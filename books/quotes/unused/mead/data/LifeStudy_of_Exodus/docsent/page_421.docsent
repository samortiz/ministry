   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE ALPHABET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR INSCRIPTION AND COMPLETION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the spiritual alphabet for inscription and also for completion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Christ whom we experience is the One who is inscribed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But even though we may have a great deal of Christ inscribed into us, we are still missing something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we realize this, we may say, I cannot have this completion in myself, but I can have it through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if you try to find this completion in the church, you will not be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church itself also needs this completion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, even if you have the church, you still need Christ as your completion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fact that Christ is the alphabet for inscription and completion indicates that He is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may have Him as the letters for inscription, but we still need Him as the letters for completion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can never exhaust Christ, for although we may enjoy His inscription, there is still something more of Him that we need for completion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, I have been experiencing Christ for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I went to Shanghai the first time, I was helped to experience Christ in a way I had not experienced Him in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After that visit to Shanghai, I returned to the north, where I held a conference and gave messages on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I learned that no matter what my experience of Christ had been, while I was giving those messages, I realized that I had actually experienced very little of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regarding the experience of Christ, I then tried to receive help from the saints and from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, I discovered that others were even more poor than I in experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Shanghai I thought that I had experienced Christ to a great degree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when I returned to the north and gave messages on Christ, I learned that I had not experienced Him very much at all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That was when I discovered what a great shortage there was among us with respect to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some saints had very little experience, and other saints had virtually no experience at all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE SHORTAGE OF THE INSCRIPTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you carefully examine the situation of Christians today, you will find out what poverty there is concerning the inscription of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A certain believer may be very good, but he may still be opaque, lacking both in transformation and in the inscribing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although such a believer has truly been saved, he has not yet been inscribed with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day Brother Nee, referring to certain persons, asked me if I thought they had been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I knew those persons rather well and answered that it seemed to me that they had been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee, somewhat in a joking way, replied, Perhaps they have been saved, but not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I asked him how it was possible for someone to be saved without being regenerated, he answered, Doctrinally, there is no such thing as a person who is saved but not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But according to actual experience, it seems that certain ones have been saved without being regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No doubt, they have been redeemed by the blood, but although we have known them for years, we have never met their regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no question that they have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, but there is no indication of the Spirit that they have a regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They just don t know to exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was surely the case that with these ones there was no inscription of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A particular saint may be a good brother or a nice sister, but how much of Christ has been inscribed into that one?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How much of Christ has been inscribed into you?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may have to admit that little of Christ has been inscribed into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because this is the situation with so many saints, in recent years my burden has become more and more heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is possible to have thousands of local churches with tens of thousands of saints, but with little experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How much have the saints in your locality been experiencing Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How much inscription of Christ do they have?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we consider our situation in this way, we may be somewhat disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At this point I would say a word to those who live in a brothers house or in a sisters house.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How much of Christ has been inscribed into those with whom you live?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have seen that each of the twelve precious stones on the breastplate was inscribed with one of the names of the tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if you consider those with whom you live in a brothers or sisters house, you may find that no one has even one complete word inscribed on him or her.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In some cases, only a part of a letter may be inscribed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers and sisters may be very good, but it is difficult to see in them the clear and definite inscription of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is one thing to be a good brother or a nice sister; it is a very different matter to have the definite experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE PROPER EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Consider once again the precious stones in the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Each stone was transparent, and each had been inscribed properly and definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, the name of the tribe of Judah had been inscribed into one of the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But, with many saints today there is a shortage of the clear and definite inscription of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, with some saints there are the definite experiences of Christ and the clear inscription of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These saints have experienced Christ as the spiritual alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The situation of most of today s Christians is far short of what God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The experience of Christ has been almost completely neglected by Christians throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many have received edification, but few have had Christ inscribed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before you came into the church life, you may have been edified in certain ways, but how much of the inscription of Christ did you have?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may have to admit that, although you were saved and regenerated, you did not have anything of Christ inscribed into you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some among us were missionaries before they came into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But although they labored on the mission field for years, they still did not have the clear and definite experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, their experience was vague and indefinite.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before I went to Shanghai in 1933, I spent more than seven years with the Brethren, from whom I learned a great deal about typology and prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But after spending a number of weeks in Shanghai, I realized that during those years I had very little experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many of us have been in a similar situation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We gained knowledge about the Bible, but not very much of Christ was inscribed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For this reason, I am deeply concerned that the saints in all the churches have the proper experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even if we are like the twelve precious stones on the breastplate transformed, transparent, and inscribed we still are not complete or perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, we need to humble ourselves and say, Lord Jesus, we are not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because we are still imperfect, Lord, we need You to be our addition and completion.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Lord, as an individual member of the church, I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Not only so, Lord, the whole church needs You.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even if as the church we are rich in experiencing You, we are yet missing something of You.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Lord, we still need You to be added to us.</S>
