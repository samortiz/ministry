<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE CHURCH<br />
INTO THE PRACTICAL BUILDING</h2>
<p>The brothers have expressed a desire to lead the church into the practical building and to send workers to propagate overseas. I wish to fellowship some practical steps concerning this.</p>
<p>I am burdened to spend several weeks to help the churches in Taiwan. During this time we may focus on perfecting the saints responsible for the district meetings. In the larger localities we need to perfect the saints and focus on the practice of building. During a recent elders&rsquo; meeting some elders suggested that we use this time to have a life-study of the books of the Prophets in the Old Testament. Even though I want to study these books, I feel we should focus on the practice of building.</p>
<p>I have considered the building up of the church, and I hope to learn something during this time. In particular, I want to learn how to administrate a large local church. Before I went overseas, I said to the brothers that I wanted to see how the Brethren administrate the church. While we were overseas, we contacted the Brethren several times but did not receive much help from them. The closed Brethren continue to be closed, and the open Brethren are so open that they want their young people to study in seminaries. Brother Sparks was also discouraged by the present condition of the Brethren. Even some brothers in America said that they visited the Brethren, and their meetings are desolate. Therefore, since we clearly see the building, we have to spend time to find a practical way to have the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPECTING SOME TO PROPAGATE OVERSEAS</h2>
<p>From the fellowship in the last two meetings and from fellowship with some of the saints, I have the assurance that some brothers and sisters have a burden to go overseas for the propagation and that we need to strengthen the testimony here. The testimony here is not to make a display of ourselves but to have a place with a strong testimony so that we can render help to others. Then saints from different places abroad can come and stay for some time to obtain practical help. We can also call a large meeting for saints from different places to come and participate, and we can have a time of training. I believe that this will render much help.</p>
<p>The service the Lord is leading us into is not something that we can put in writing and send out in printed form for other believers to read and understand. Printed messages cannot meet this need. There are many skills for us to learn in our service, even if we do not feel that this is our need. It is difficult to understand something that is described only in printed material. In order to receive the proper knowledge, it is best to see a practical demonstration. In secular terms, we need to send people out as &ldquo;technical personnel,&rdquo; who can live in a place for two to three years to help the local church there and then move to another place. The &ldquo;technical personnel&rdquo; go out to instruct people. The church here also needs to serve as a &ldquo;factory&rdquo; where believers can come to learn and to do an &ldquo;internship.&rdquo; In principle, this should be our future situation. We should send saints out, and saints can come here to learn.</p>
<p>I do not know where we should go or how many believers should be in the city we go to. These matters depend on the burden that the brothers receive from the Lord. We should not expect anyone to push us if we do not have a burden. Do not expect me to motivate you to carry out a work for which you have no feeling. We need to see a vision and receive a burden. Then we should devote ourselves wholeheartedly to our burden. If we do this, we can receive help and be motivated. We must respond before someone can help us. Where we should go depends on the burden that we receive from the Lord.</p>
<p>It may be of the Lord that many places overseas are waiting for help from Taiwan. Japan and different places in Southeast Asia are expecting helpers to come from Taiwan. The door is wide open. If the brothers have the burden to learn some lessons and to receive a burden to labor in these places, we will receive the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. As long as we go and labor, God&rsquo;s blessing will be upon us. Of course, wherever we go to labor will not be as convenient as here. This is our home where everything is convenient. If we go abroad, we will need to learn many things. We will need to learn the lesson of faith to take risks, to meet different needs, and to deal with different problems. In all of this we should trust that the Lord&rsquo;s grace is sufficient and that His blessing will overflow.</p>
<p>We should also consider how to give practical help to the saints who visit us from overseas. We should not try to do something too large. I have been reluctant to have a training on how to practically carry out the building, because of the practical arrangements that need to be made. We do not want the training to be formal and lack flexibility. Furthermore, because the procedure for entry into Taiwan is complicated, a large number of people cannot come at the same time. If we are willing to conduct a large training and the entry procedure into Taiwan is relaxed, we might be able to have a training in the fall of next year. More saints will be able to come at that time.</p>
<p>I believe that the Lord is leading us to have some saints go out and is leading others to come here to learn. In this way the Lord will have a practical way to propagate among us.</p>
