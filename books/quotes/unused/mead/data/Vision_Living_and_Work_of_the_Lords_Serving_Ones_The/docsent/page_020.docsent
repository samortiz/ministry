   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN LEADING NEW BELIEVERS TO EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST 2 THE TRIUNE GOD BEING PROCESSED</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO BECOME THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many years ago we saw that in order to experience Christ s death we need to have the experience of the Holy Spirit, but we did not see that in the New Testament the Holy Spirit has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This life-giving Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit who passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through the process that the Triune God went through, various elements were added to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit of God had only the element of divinity, but through the Lord s incarnation, the element of humanity was added to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, and the element of human living was added to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Humanity was added to the Spirit through the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, and human living was added through His living as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the elements of death and resurrection were also added to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we dare not consider resurrection and ascension as two separate elements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection are four elements.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we do not consider ascension as another element, because ascension is a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His ascension Christ entered into a new position; hence, ascension is not a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>EXPERIENCING THE HUMAN LIVING OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IN THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT Being under Brother Nee s Big Umbrella</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have all experienced joys and sorrows in our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These experiences have added many elements into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The saying going through wind and frost means that a person experiences many hardships and sufferings; many elements have been added into him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am eighty years of age, and my life has been full of wind and frost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today I can say that nothing affects me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was not born into a poor family, but when I was about ten years old, my family situation had a drastic change, and we reached the point of dire poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time I began to experience hardships and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, I was saved and I loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then at the initial stage of my serving the Lord, I was under the big umbrella of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He shielded me from the rain and from the storms.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the slandering fell on him, and all the rumors were aimed at him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Under that big umbrella, I was like a favored son knowing only to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, due to the change in the political situation in China, I was brought into another situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moving to Taiwan</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In November 1948 the United States had a presidential election, and many Chinese people hoped that the candidate of the Republican Party would be elected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was in Hangchow leading a special conference concerning the migration to Yi-yang, Kiangsi Province, when I received a cable from Brother Nee asking me to drop everything and take a train immediately to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, I made arrangements for the last meeting and went to the train station with my luggage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the station I saw a newspaper reporting that Harry Truman had won the election.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Upon arriving in Shanghai, Brother Nee informed me that there would be an urgent co-workers meeting that night to deal with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After a long period of silence at the beginning of the meeting, Brother Nee said, The situation today is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to fellowship, pray, and seek the Lord s leading concerning how to deal with this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, in any case we would ask Brother Lee to go abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we had purchased a piece of land on Nanyang Road in Shanghai and were prepared to build a big meeting hall, Brother Nee charged me to oversee the building of the meeting hall and leave Shanghai upon its completion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The following year in February Brother Nee called another urgent co-workers meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the meeting he said, We still would ask Brother Lee to go abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, in April I left Shanghai for Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Taiwan my family of ten lived in a room that was about two hundred eighty square feet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every day I lay in my bed and stared at the ceiling, asking what I was doing in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day the Lord spoke to me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said that I should go and visit the brothers and sisters who had come to Taiwan from mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, I traveled along the main north-south railway visiting the saints at every stop.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the visiting, I picked up a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After returning to Taipei, I fellowshipped with a few brothers and told them that there were about three to four hundred brothers and sisters in Taiwan who had come from the mainland and that they would be the base of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, we began the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once we began, the work advanced with overwhelming momentum.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the first year the number of people increased thirtyfold.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Within five to six years there was a hundredfold increase; that is, the original four hundred grew to about forty thousand.</S>
