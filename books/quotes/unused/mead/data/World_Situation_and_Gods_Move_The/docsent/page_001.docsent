   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The events of world history have been sovereignly arranged by God for Him to carry out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As Acts 17:26 says, He "hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The rise and fall of the kingdoms of earth and the boundaries of all the nations have been predetermined by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these messages, given in Anaheim, California in the spring of 1981, we have tried to present a view of world events from this perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the church comes out of mankind, we as His chosen ones need to have this view of man's history.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's move among men is wrapped up with the course of history.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether we speak of His becoming flesh through the incarnation, or of the spread of the gospel, or of the raising up of the church life, or of the preparation of the bride, all these aspects of His move require the proper environment, as far as the world situation is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We trust that these messages will make the reader more aware of God's arrangement of world affairs, more concerned about the crucial time in which we live, and more burdened for His ultimate move in what might be the ultimate world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Witness Lee</S>
