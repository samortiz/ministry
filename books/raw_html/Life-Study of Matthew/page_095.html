<h2 class="head2">D. Two Kinds of Building<br />upon Two Kinds of Foundation</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Building on the Rock<br />according to the Lord&rsquo;s Words</h2><p>In verse 24 the King said, &ldquo;Every one therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to a prudent man, who built his house on the rock.&rdquo; The rock here does not refer to Christ, but to His wise word, the word that reveals the will of His Father who is in the heavens. The kingdom people&rsquo;s living and work must be founded on the word of the new King for the accomplishment of the will of the heavenly Father. This is to enter the narrow gate and walk the constricted way which leads to life.</p><p>Verse 25 says, &ldquo;And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and fell on that house; and it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.&rdquo; The rain is of God, descending from the heavens; the rivers are of man, coming from the earth; and the winds are of Satan, blowing from the air. All these will test the living and work of the kingdom people. Although the rain may descend, the rivers may come, and the winds may blow, the house built upon the rock will not fall because it is built according to the constricted way, the way of doing the will of the Father. The house built on the rock which does not fall is like the building work of gold, silver, and precious stones, which can stand the testing fire (1 Cor. 3:12-13).</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Building on the Sand<br />Not according to the Lord&rsquo;s Words</h2><p>Verse 26 says, &ldquo;And every one who hears these words of Mine and does not do them shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.&rdquo; Sand here refers to human concepts and natural ways. If we live and work according to our human concepts and natural ways, our living and work will be founded on sinking sand. This is to enter the wide gate and walk on the broad way that leads to destruction. Verse 27 says, &ldquo;And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat against that house; and it fell, and the fall of it was great.&rdquo; The house built on the sand which falls is like the building work of wood, hay, and stubble, which will be burned by the testing fire. However, the builder himself will be saved (1 Cor. 3:12-15). To build our house upon our opinion and concept is to build the house upon sinking sand. When the rain, the rivers, and the winds test the house built upon the sand, the house, not having a solid foundation, will fall. This is the Lord&rsquo;s conclusion of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>The basic concept of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is that the kingdom people should be righteously strict with themselves, mercifully kind toward others, and secretly pure toward God.</p><p>I cannot tell you how much this constitution has controlled me throughout the years. I can testify that my living, my walk, and my work are under this constitution. I hope that all of us will be ushered into this constricted way to build a house upon the solid rock according to the will of our heavenly Father.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. AUTHORITY IN SPEAKING</h2><p>Verses 28 and 29 say, &ldquo;And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these words, the crowds were astounded at His teaching, for He was teaching them as One having authority, and not as their scribes.&rdquo; Christ, as the new King of the kingdom of the heavens, spoke with authority in decreeing the new law of the kingdom.</p>
