   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There have been erroneous teachings concerning sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Catholicism only special "holy" people are called saints, meaning sanctified ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this second step, the function which follows regeneration, means the increase of God's element in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Consider the behavior of those who are of the world, those you see at work or at school or among your relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their way of living is blind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They follow whatever others do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If it is convenient to tell a lie, they have no hesitation about doing so; if they might be caught, then they do not.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is little difference among them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What characterizes those in the world should not characterize us who have the Lord's life within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There should be a separation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not to say that we should wear a sign, saying that we are Christians and different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nor should we try to give the impression that we are superior to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sanctification does not refer to any such artificial distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is simply the adding of God to us, as day by day we open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the time we are saved and His Spirit comes into us, there should be a continual increase of His life, making us different from those around us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This change can be observed by our parents or teachers; they will see that we are not the way we used to be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not need a label saying we are separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is an inward work going on, something growing up and living out of us, that makes us different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are being "sanctified in the Holy Spirit" Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What we are talking about is not moral improvement but a renewing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not laboring to be better behaved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The change others see comes because we have a life and a Spirit within that produces this fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose there is a tree which seems dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no foliage, and the branches are dry and brittle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The root, though, is still intact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You begin to supply fertilizer and water to it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In time signs of life appear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some tender buds sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The trees around it may be withered and lifeless, but this one is showing evidence of life by its newness and freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is life in this tree; that is what makes it different from the other ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sanctification is the adding of God's element into us, making us different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The third process is the metabolic change that takes place in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As God's element is being added into us, the old elements are flushed out and replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our physical body the process of metabolism never ceases.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It regulates the assimilation of our food, the discharge of the dead cells, and their replacement with healthy, new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Scripture tells us, "Be transformed" Rom 12:2 , it does not mean that we should try to make ourselves different in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If my metabolism is poor, I may look pale and ill.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The answer does not lie in using artificial coloring so that I seem healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What I need is nourishing food, adequate rest, and proper exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then, after a few months, my skin color will improve, as a result of the metabolic changes that have taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As Christians, we do not care for outward pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The transformation that we experience happens metabolically, as God's element is added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are being inwardly transformed, not outwardly improved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The work in a mortuary is to make dead people look well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The pallid skin is masked with rosy coloring.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some messages in Christianity in effect do the work of a mortician.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The object is to make lifeless ones look healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What a contrast this is to the Lord's way!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He cleanses away all that is false.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He puts His life into us, so that we can be changed in our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He provides us with nourishing food and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Transformation is the result.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On our part, we need to be sure to get the proper nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without eating, we cannot have the metabolic process operate properly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is as we nourish the divine life in us that we are transformed.</S>
