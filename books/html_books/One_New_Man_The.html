The known world at that time was not as big as it is today. When people spoke concerning the world, they referred mainly to the world around the Mediterranean Sea under the Roman Empire. But in God&#8217;s intention, the world was not that small. The world includes the entire globe. Two thousand years ago the world was considered to be flat. At that time no one realized that the world was a sphere. However, today in a conference we may see saints who come from all the six continents. To see brothers and sisters who represent so many nations of the world stirs up my burden to minister on the one new man. This is the right time for us to see the one new man.<h2 class=head1>THE ASSEMBLY</h2><p>We all have to admit that since the time of the apostles until at least the sixteenth century the church was going downward. By the sixteenth century the church had fallen to the bottom, into the dark ages. It could not go any lower. At this time the Lord came in to start His recovery. He started the recovery from the very base of the biblical truth, justification by faith. Luther did see something concerning the church as well, but he did not have much time to care for this matter. He saw something of the church, yet he did not see enough.<p>A little more than two centuries later Count Zinzendorf, with so many other brothers, the so-called Moravian brothers, saw something more concerning the church. In Bohemia, on the land owned by Zinzendorf, they started to have the practice of the church. That was the first step of the Lord&#8217;s recovery of the church practice. By reading church history, you could realize that before Zinzendorf, no one was so clear concerning the church practice. Their practice was good, yet it was not complete.<p>One century later, in the early 1800s, the Lord went on from Bohemia to England, raising up a group of seekers, including John Nelson Darby and other brothers. They began to practice the church life. Their practice was a great improvement over that which was practiced under the leadership of Zinzendorf at Bohemia. These brothers began to see that the church is the assembly of God&#8217;s called out ones (Eph. 1:22; 1 Cor. 1:2). The church is the gathering of all the dear saints who have been called in Christ out of this world. Thus, they began to drop the English term &#8220;church,&#8221; because they realized that it had been damaged through wrong usage. At that time fallen Christianity considered the church to be a physical building, perhaps with a &#8220;high tower&#8221; and a bell. Even today, many parents say to their children on Sunday morning, &#8220;Let us go to church,&#8221; referring to the wood, the stone, the brick, and the glass. How pitiful that was, and how pitiful it still is today. The Brethren dropped this wrong concept, and they even dropped the term church. They began to use the word &#8220;assembly.&#8221; After this the Assembly of God followed them to use the word assembly.<p>I agree with the word assembly. The word assembly is better than the word church. The Greek word for church is ekklesia. The ekklesia is a gathering of the called ones. The root and basic element of the word ekklesia is the word for calling. Ek means out, and kaleo means call. The church is the called out ones coming together, being gathered or assembled together. The Brethren saw this and they made this very clear in their teachings. Even today you can see this in their books. How we thank God for this. The Brethren did have a good start in dropping the wrong usage and wrong concept of the term church and in using the right word for the church, that is, the assembly. Although the English word assembly does not convey the thought of being called out, in the Greek, as I mentioned already, the basic thought is the gathering of the called out ones.<h2 class=head1>THE HOUSEHOLD</h2><p>Beginning also with the Brethren, the saints began to see that the church is God&#8217;s household, God&#8217;s family. This is clearly revealed in Ephesians 2:19 which says, &#8220;So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God.&#8221; The very God is our Father and we all are His children. Being His children, we are the folks of God&#8217;s family. The Greek word for household refers both to the house, the dwelling place, and to the household, the family. You can translate the same word with these two meanings. The end of Ephesians 2 reveals the household as the habitation of God. Verse 19 mentions the household, while verse 22 says that we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. The household is the dwelling place, the habitation.<p>Today, physically speaking, the household can never be the dwelling place of a father. However, spiritually speaking, all of God&#8217;s children at the same time are both God&#8217;s family and also God&#8217;s dwelling place. God&#8217;s habitation is built with His children. Therefore, His children are both His family and His dwelling place. The family is the dwelling place. We can declare to the whole universe that we are both God&#8217;s family and God&#8217;s house. We are His children, and at the same time we are His dwelling place. The Brethren, in their teachings, have made this very clear. From the assembly, the gathering of God&#8217;s called ones, they went on to the family of God, the household, and to the habitation of God.<h2 class=head1>THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>The Brethren also saw that the church, which is the family, the household of God, is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23; 1 Cor. 10:17; 12:27). Some Christian teachers say that the Body of Christ is merely a parable illustrating how close we are to Christ. According to this teaching, we are close to Christ just like the members of the body are close to the head. We must correct this wrong teaching. The Body of Christ is not a parable but a fact. It would be terrible to say that my body is a parable. My body is not an illustration; it is a fact. Likewise, the church as the Body of Christ is a fact, not a parable. You may consider the vine tree in John 15 as a parable, but you cannot say that the church being the Body of Christ is a parable.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW MAN</h2><p>The church is first the assembly, second the household, third the Body, and finally the new man. In the one book of Ephesians all these points are there. The ekklesia is in chapter one (v. 22), the household is in chapter two (v. 19), the Body is in chapters one, two, three, four, and five (1:23; 2:16; 3:6; 4:4, 12, 16; 5:23, 30), and the new man is in chapters two and four (2:15; 4:24). The new man is the highest aspect of the church.<p>Those who translated the Revised Standard Version of the Bible made a great mistake when they translated the new man in Ephesians 4:24 into &#8220;the new nature.&#8221; In the Greek text, the new man here is the same phrase that is used in 2:15-&#8220;that He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&#8221; To translate the same phrase in 4:24 as the new nature is a mistake. The word for man in 4:24 is also used in 4:13, which says, &#8220;Until we all arrive...at a full-grown man.&#8221; This verse cannot be translated, &#8220;until we all arrive at a full-grown nature.&#8221; In the same chapter, chapter four of Ephesians, this word is used at least twice-a full-grown man and a new man. From the Body we must go on to see that the church is the new man.<h2 class=head1>HAVING NO CHOICE IN THE BODY</h2><p>At the beginning level, the church is an assembly, a gathering of God&#8217;s called ones. The household is a higher aspect of the church than the assembly. Do you prefer the assembly or the household? An assembly may be a group of people having different lives, but a household is a number of persons having the same life of one father. The household is much better than the assembly. To say that the church is an assembly is good, but not that sweet. In the United Nations, there is an assembly. Every session in the United Nations is an assembly-an assembly of debaters and opposers. We do not care for this kind of assembly. However, in the New Testament the assembly means the gathering of the called out ones. It is wonderful to be called out. But simply to be called out, without having the Father&#8217;s life, is not so wonderful. To be called out does not indicate that you have the life of the calling one. The assembly does not indicate any life, but the household does.<p>The Body is a higher aspect of the church than the household. In the household are the &#8220;folks,&#8221; but in the Body are the members. When the members of a family are happy, they stay together, but when they are unhappy they may fight and depart from one another. However, in the body the arm cannot say to the shoulder, &#8220;I do not feel so good about you; I would like to leave you.&#8221; The arm cannot leave because it is under the shoulder. Whether it likes the shoulder or not, its destiny is to be with this shoulder. In my early days I was under the &#8220;shoulder.&#8221; Many times I did not feel so good being there, but I realized that as an &#8220;arm&#8221; I could do nothing about it. It was neither the shoulder&#8217;s mistake nor my mistake; it was the Head&#8217;s arrangement. It was the Creator&#8217;s arrangement to put me, the arm, under that big shoulder.<p>Not only was I put under a big shoulder, but I was also arranged to be above so many &#8220;small fingers.&#8221; You do not know how much trouble all these little ones gave me. I wanted to go one way, but they liked to do things in another way. If I liked to be quiet, they would talk all the time. But if I cut off all the fingers, what could I do? I would be an arm without a hand. The Body of Christ is more binding to us than the household.<p>If you have seen that the church is the Body, you could never turn away from the church. If you have only seen that the church is an assembly, when you are happy you will stay but when you do not feel happy, you will leave. Even in the household it is the same; once you are unhappy with another member of the family, you may decide to leave. If you have only seen that the church is God&#8217;s household, you will not be so steadfast. When you feel happy with the brothers, you will stay, but when you do not feel happy, you will stay away. However, if you have seen that you are a member of the Body, you have no choice. Today many Christians are talking about the Body, but what they are speaking may not be real in their practice. Today they are in one &#8220;body,&#8221; but after two weeks they will be in another &#8220;body.&#8221; Then after two months they will be in a third &#8220;body.&#8221; They have many &#8220;bodies.&#8221; When you have many &#8220;bodies,&#8221;  none of these is the Body. The Body is uniquely one. Ephesians 4:4 says, &#8220;One Body and one Spirit.&#8221; There are not many &#8220;bodies.&#8221; If you are a member in the Body, you could never leave. If you would say that you cannot be here because this is not the Body, either you are wrong or the group with which you meet is wrong.<p>I am not fellowshipping with you something that I have never experienced. I have been experiencing and am still experiencing the Body. Whether the people here love me or whether they mistreat me, my destiny is to be a member of the Body. I have no choice. The Lord Jesus told us that He gave us a new commandment, that we all love one another (John 13:34), but we may talk about loving one another in a natural way. In our natural mind we all understand how we need to love one another. To love one another could be applied both to the assembly and to the household. In a family the parents always charge the children to love one another. You may also say that the members of the Body need to love one another. But in the Body to love one another is a little different from loving one another in the assembly and in the household. As I mentioned already, in an assembly if I feel happy with you I will stay with you, but if I do not feel happy with you, I may simply leave. Even in a household, if I feel happy with you, I will talk to you, but if I do not feel happy with you, I may stay in my room and close the door. But you can never stay away from the Body. You have no choice. Many times my eyes were filled with tears, but I was happy. On the one hand, we should be happy because we are in the Body. On the other hand, do not think the Body life is so happy.<p>Many times I have considered in this way. First, I am a man because God created me. I have to be a man; I had no choice regarding my being born. Being a man, I also have no choice but to be a Christian. Third, being a Christian, I have to be in the church. If I am not in the church, it is meaningless for me to be a Christian, and if I am not a Christian, it is meaningless for me to be a man. I have to be a man, I have to be a Christian, and I have to be in the church. Eventually, I am a member in the Body.<p>Throughout the years I have realized that a number of the saints are ambitious, desiring to have a position. Once a brother becomes an elder, it is very difficult for him not to be an elder. Once he loses the eldership he may be troubled. Although others do not trouble him, he may be troubled by his ambition. A number were troubled because they did not have a chance to be a leader. If they could not be an elder in the church, at least they wanted to be a leader of a service group. However, if you do have the burden to serve and you do see what the church is, you will have the desire to participate in the church service. Whether there is a service group or no service group, you will simply come to serve. The problem here is the impure motive.<p>My point is that, in the Body, such ambitious persons who choose to be somebody cannot have any peace. As a man I have to be a Christian, as a Christian I have to be in the proper church life, and as one in the proper church life, I have to submit myself to the Body. I have no choice. Do you have the choice? If you feel that you do, then you do not know what the Body is. In the Body to love one another means that we have no choice. You may not care to be a member of the Body, a Christian, or even a man. If so, you will be a very miserable person. We should simply behave ourselves in the Body.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH AS A MAN WITH A UNIQUE PERSON</h2><p>The church is not only the assembly, the household, and the Body. The church is a man. Nothing could be higher than this item. The new man is the highest aspect of the church. As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; whereas as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person. Fifty years ago I was always trying to love others, but one day I saw that the church is the new man. That terminated my trying because in the new man there is only one Person.<p>Colossians 3:10 and 11 have never been so clear as they are today. These verses say, &#8220;And having put on the new man...where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; You do not have any place in the new man, and neither do I. We do not have any place to hate anyone. We do not have any place even to love anyone. You may charge me to love others, but in the new man I have no place. You may charge me to be so kind to others and so nice and gentle. But I have seen that the church is the new man, and in this new man I have no place. In this new man Christ is all.<p>In verse 11 &#8220;all&#8221; does not refer to all things or matters but to persons. In the new man Christ is all the persons. Christ is you and Christ is me; Christ is all and in all. He is all the members of the new man and in all the members. Many misinterpret this word all. They understand this to mean that Christ is all things to me. The word all in this verse is the same as in Ephesians 4:6, where it says, &#8220;One God and Father of all.&#8221; All there does not refer to all matters or all things, but to all persons. God the Father is not the Father of all matters or of all things, but of all persons, the believers. It is the same in Colossians 3:11.<p>In this new man you have no place. In other words, in this new man the Jew has no place, and neither does the Greek. The American has no place, and neither does the British. The Japanese has no place, and neither does the Chinese. In this new man the natural man has no place. The hating ones have no place. Neither do the loving ones have any place. We all have no place in this man. The quick one has no place. The slow one also has no place. Circumcision refers to the religious ones and uncircumcision to the unreligious ones. The religious ones and the unreligious ones all have no place in this new man. The civilized or the barbarian have no place. The slaves and the freemen have no place because Christ in this new man is all the persons. Christ becomes you and Christ becomes me. Christ becomes every one of us. Christ is all the persons and Christ is in all the persons. In this new man it is not a matter of being humble, kind, gentle, or loving. It is altogether a matter of a person living in us. In this new man it is not a matter of morality, ethics, or goodness. In this new man there is only one person.<p>The church in its uttermost aspect is a new man to accomplish God&#8217;s eternal purpose. God needs a man, a corporate man. I do look to the Lord that we all may be brought into the highest vision, that we would see that the church is not only the gathering, the assembly of God&#8217;s called ones, not only the folks of God&#8217;s household, and not only the Body of Christ, but also the new man, created according to the image of God-Christ. The new man is created according to Christ, having Christ as his person. This new man can accomplish what God intends to fulfill on this earth.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>WORLD HISTORY IN THE LIGHT OF GOD&#8217;S PURPOSE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26-28; 10:5, 20, 31, 32; 11:7-9; Acts 2:5-11; Rev. 5:9-10; Eph. 2:13-15; 4:22-24; Col. 3:10-11</h1><p>The Bible is a record of two men, the old man and the new man. The record of the Old Testament is a record of the old man, and the record of the New Testament is the record of the new man. According to the entire revelation of the Bible, God&#8217;s intention is to have a man for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. For God to accomplish His eternal purpose, He needs a man. God&#8217;s eternal purpose is to express Himself. For this reason God created man in His own image (Gen. 1:26). God is invisible, yet the invisible God has a visible image. His purpose is to make Himself, the invisible One, visible through a man.<p>Man was created for the purpose of expressing God. God could only be expressed in man and through man. The angels are wonderful, but the angels cannot express God. Some of the Chinese give their daughters the name of a bird. That means they have a high appreciation for birds. In Europe and America it is a high compliment to a woman if someone says, &#8220;She is just like an angel.&#8221; The term angel is a term of appreciation. People may highly regard the birds and the angels, but God&#8217;s intention is to have a man. Angels were not made in God&#8217;s image. Only man was made in the image of God.<p>What is the image of God? Colossians 1:15 and 2 Corinthians 4:4 tell us that Christ is the image of God. Therefore, when God created man in His own image, He made man according to Christ. Furthermore, according to Genesis 1:26, where God&#8217;s image is, God&#8217;s dominion follows. Wherever God is expressed, there is the reign, the ruling of God. God&#8217;s authority, God&#8217;s kingdom, and God&#8217;s dominion always follow God&#8217;s image. If we have God&#8217;s image and God is expressed, we surely also have God&#8217;s kingdom, God&#8217;s dominion.<h2 class=head1>A RECORD OF THE DIVIDED MAN</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention in creating man was to have a vessel to express Himself and to exercise His dominion. However, not long after man was created, he fell. The verses at the beginning of this chapter should help you to see the real significance of man&#8217;s fall. It was the intention of God&#8217;s enemy that, through man&#8217;s fall, man would be divided and scattered. Chapter three of Genesis begins to speak of the fall of man, but it does not show us the significance of man&#8217;s fall. The significance of man&#8217;s fall is revealed in chapters ten and eleven. There we can see clearly what Satan&#8217;s intention was in causing man to fall. It was to make man useless in God&#8217;s purpose by dividing and scattering mankind.<p>After the flood, mankind was divided into nations and was also scattered in different directions to different lands. Around the time of the building up of Babel, mankind was divided according to their families, their genealogies, their languages, their lands, and eventually, according to the nations (Gen. 10:5, 20, 31). Different families, different genealogies, different languages, and different lands eventually issued in different nations (v. 32). All were divided and scattered. Then mankind was no more one. God did not create men; rather, God created man. Man in Genesis 1 refers to mankind. The whole of mankind was intended to be one man.<p>The function of any vessel, when it is divided and scattered, is annulled and voided. A vessel should not be broken; a vessel should not be divided and scattered. Man, as a vessel to contain God, to express God, and to exercise God&#8217;s dominion, should be one. He should not be divided or scattered. However, in chapters ten and eleven of Genesis this vessel was shattered into pieces and was scattered. The entire Old Testament is simply a record of the divided mankind.<h2 class=head1>THE CREATION OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p>From Genesis chapters ten and eleven we must go on to Acts 2. By the time of Acts 2 the Triune God had passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The God-man Jesus had been enthroned in the heavens to be the Lord of lords. Now something further happened in Acts 2. After creation and the fall of man this wonderful One who was incarnated, who was God living a life in humanity on this earth, and who was crucified, resurrected, ascended, and enthroned, came down. His coming down was a wonder among all wonders. This coming down of such a wonderful One brought forth the church.<p>The church was brought forth not just with one people, but with many peoples. In Acts 2:9-11 at least fifteen nationalities speaking at least fifteen dialects are represented. Although all these were Jews (v. 5), under God&#8217;s sovereignty all these Jews were not of one language. They were people of many different dialects. They were Jews, but they were divided and scattered. However, when the time came for the church to be brought forth, they were all gathered together, and in that gathering the church was produced. This indicates that what was divided and scattered in the old man was fully recovered in the new man. In the old man, man was divided and scattered, but in the new man, man is gathered and made one.<p>Without Paul&#8217;s Epistles, we could not see the light concerning the one new man. Ephesians 2:13 says, &#8220;But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ.&#8221; To become near is to become near not only to God but near to the believers. Verse 14 says, &#8220;For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity.&#8221; The middle wall of partition is the division, the dividing factor between different peoples. This factor was torn down by Christ on the cross. By this, Christ has created one new man of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles. Ephesians 4:22 says, &#8220;That you have put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.&#8221; To put off the old man is to put off the divided and scattered man. To put on the new man (v. 24) is to put on the gathered and one new man, &#8220;which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth&#8221; (v. 24).<p>Colossians 3:10-11 reveals something further. In this new man the Greek and the Jew, the circumcision (the religious ones) and the uncircumcision (the unreligious ones), the barbarian and the Scythian, and the slave and the freeman all have no place. Christ is all the members and in all the members (v. 11). God&#8217;s eternal purpose is to have this one new man for His full expression.<p>Paul saw this vision and wrote the two Epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians. However, he could not have realized that a part of the globe was still undiscovered. He did not realize that at that time there were Indians in America. Acts 2:5 refers to &#8220;men from every nation under heaven.&#8221; However, the &#8220;heaven&#8221; was only that which covered the Mediterranean and Mesopotamian area. It did not even cover China, India, or Japan. We, however, are not in the first century but in the twentieth century. Now we can realize God&#8217;s purpose to a further extent. At that time Paul did not know of America, but now we are in America. His heaven only covered the Mediterranean and Mesopotamian lands; our heaven today covers all the continents, the entire globe.<h2 class=head1>FOUR MAJOR EVENTS OF HISTORY</h2><p>Human history spans almost six thousand years-four thousand years before Christ and two thousand years after Christ. In the last two thousand years there have been four great events. To accomplish His purpose on this earth, God needs to direct the political situation. The entire political situation on this earth is under God&#8217;s sovereignty.<h2 class=head2>The Establishment of the Roman Empire</h2><p>The first major event of history in the last two thousand years was the founding and establishment of the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire was established by Caesar Augustus around 31 B.C., a little over thirty years before Christ was born. This came into being for the spreading, the propagation, of the gospel. Before Christ was born, the Roman Empire was founded to prepare the way for the gospel to be spread to all the peoples under heaven. Before the establishment of the Roman Empire, the peoples around the Mediterranean were fully divided. It was the Roman Empire that made the Greek language the international language of all the peoples around the Mediterranean Sea. When the time came that the gospel should be preached, all the peoples around the Mediterranean were prepared to understand one language. One language, Greek, was sufficient for the preaching of the gospel. Wherever the apostles went, there was no problem of language because the Roman Empire had done this wonderful thing for the preaching of the gospel.<p>The Apostle Paul could freely visit other countries because the Roman Empire had unified all the different nations around the Mediterranean under one empire. This made it so convenient for the spreading of the gospel. One citizenship was good enough. In Acts 22, when Paul was about to be beaten, he appealed on the grounds of his Roman citizenship (v. 25). The Roman Empire also built highways throughout Europe and Asia-Minor, from Spain to Jerusalem. Not only was there the traffic on the Mediterranean Sea, but also there were the highways built on the land by the Roman Empire. This also was so convenient for the spreading of the gospel. Furthermore, the Roman Empire was strong to keep a peaceful order among all the peoples around the Mediterranean Sea.<p>The Roman Empire accomplished these four things. They made Greek the international language, they unified all the nations into one empire, they built highways, and they kept a very peaceful order for the spreading of the gospel. The Roman Empire was founded only about thirty years before Christ, and about thirty years after Christ&#8217;s birth, the gospel was accomplished and was ready to be preached. By that time the language was ready, the empire was unified, the highways were built, and the peaceful order was maintained. Everything was in favor of the spreading of the gospel. This was the first major thing that happened in these last two thousand years for the spreading of the gospel. Within less than fifty years the gospel was preached to all the nations under the heaven around the Mediterranean Sea.<h2 class=head2>The Reformation and the Discovery of the New World Liberating Man&#8217;s Mentality</h2><p>After the church was brought forth, it began to decline and degrade, eventually reaching the dark ages. At this time Martin Luther was raised up to recover the truth concerning justification by faith. It was sovereign of God that also around that time Columbus discovered America. The reformation of the church and the discovery of the new land liberated man&#8217;s mentality which had been imprisoned under Catholicism. Since that time also science was improved and industry was increased. Through science and industry &#8220;isms&#8221; such as capitalism, socialism, and, eventually due to overproduction, imperialism came into being. All these isms are wrong things, but we must realize that they were sovereignly used by God to open the doors of the divided and closed people. This was the second major item of history-the liberation of the imprisoned mentality under Catholicism through the Reformation under Martin Luther and the discovery of the new world. History tells us that these events brought in a great change in man&#8217;s thinking.<h2 class=head2>Britain&#8217;s Defeat of Spain</h2><p>The third great item of history was the defeat of Spain by Britain. After Columbus&#8217;s discovery of the new land, Spain became the dominant power of the whole world. For this reason Central America and South America are Spanish speaking. The so-called Latin Americas are actually the Spanish Americas. Since Spain was fully for Catholicism, God raised up Britain to defeat Spain. Merely by a short battle on the sea, Spain was defeated. From that time on, Britain became the major power over the whole world. It was said that the sun never set on the British Empire. Britain became such a wide-spread power over the world, and this was used by God to spread His gospel, not by Catholicism, but by the Protestant missionaries. It was through this third major item of history that the gospel was brought to every corner of all the continents, especially to Asia, Africa, and Australasia. Catholicism is not so prevailing on these continents. This was God&#8217;s sovereign doing to bring the gospel to all the nations.<h2 class=head2>The Raising Up of the United States</h2><p>However, this is not all, because the new man has not yet come into fullness. Years ago, I met some dear missionaries who happily told me that the gospel had been brought to every continent and every corner of the earth. However, God cannot be so happy because He still has not reached His goal. God&#8217;s goal is not that the gospel be preached in every corner of the earth. His goal is to have the new man. The new man is a replacement of the old man. For the replacement of the old man, the new man must be constituted with every people, every tribe, and every nation. In this sense, it was not possible to have the new man to the extent that it is possible today.<p>One hundred fifty years ago the Americans and Europeans who went to China were considered by the Chinese to be foreign devils. Likewise, one hundred fifty years ago some unlearned Chinese came to this country and were looked down upon by the white people. There was no understanding between the two peoples. At that time for an American missionary to go to China required that he sail the Pacific for six months. In one year he could only travel there and come back. Some missionaries, after six months of sailing, arrived at China sick and exhausted. The communication and the transportation were awkward, and the understanding between the peoples was terrible.<p>God used the first and second world wars to change the situation. For the purpose of warfare, there were many new inventions, especially in the field of transportation. The first world war was resolved after the United States entered into it. This country was much used by God. President Wilson, after the victory in the first world war, proposed to the other two major powers, Britain and France, that an international organization be formed to oversee the relations between the different peoples of the world. Britain and France instead took the lead to form the League of Nations in Geneva. That League of Nations was not proper, however, and was brought to nought after the Japanese invasion of China from 1931 to 1937, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, and the German invasion of Bohemia in 1939. These three invasions buried the League of Nations and ushered in World War II. Eventually God again used the United States to help resolve the situation. This time the United States had the full ground to take the lead to form the United Nations in New York. Through these two wars God raised up the United States to be the leading nation and the number one power on the earth. This was the fourth great item of history, and was not for the sake of the United States, but was for God&#8217;s purpose to gain the new man.<p>Nearly every nation is formed with its own race. Japan was formed with the Japanese race, and China was formed with the Chinese race. But the United States is not a country of race, but a country of different peoples &#8220;melted&#8221; together. This country also has always had the policy to conduct international exchange in science, medicine, mathematics, and in many cultural matters. This cultural exchange has done much to bring different nations and different people into one understanding.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S SOVEREIGNTY FOR THE PERFECTION OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p>In addition to this, due to modern inventions, transportation and communication have been greatly improved. Today we have jet airlines, radio, television, satellites, and telephones not just for domestic calls but also for international calls. Whatever happens in America can be seen or heard in Taiwan. We have all these things to bring people together. These modern inventions have condensed the whole globe.<p>Forty years ago I was in the Lord&#8217;s ministry primarily in Chefoo in the north of China and Shanghai in central China. By plane today the trip between these cities is very quick, but at that time we had no other way but to take a steamboat. I had to be in the boat for about forty hours to get from Chefoo to Shanghai. I suffered sea sickness very much due to that trip. However, today one can fly from Los Angeles to Taipei in only thirteen hours. Through modern education people have also learned to speak other languages. There is a mingling of many different peoples.<p>Today the situation on the earth has been very much improved and made ready and ripe to have the new man. At the time of the Apostle Paul it was not like this. Paul did not have a brother among the American Indians, but in the new man today we do have brothers and sisters from among the Indians. Eventually, I believe that among the Indian reservations there will be some churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The world situation has been raised up for the one goal of the new man. Now we have different peoples all mingled together in the one new man.<p>God&#8217;s purpose is to have a man to express Him and to exercise His dominion. The old man failed God, but God has raised up a new man to replace the old man. Still even today we could not see a perfect new man on the earth to replace the fallen old man. However, our God can never be defeated. Now is the very time for Him to accomplish His purpose to perfect the new man. This new man will come into full existence on the earth. God needs such a man to express Himself and to exercise His dominion. When this new man is perfected, that will be the time of the Lord&#8217;s coming, and the perfected new man will be the bride. We need such a vision.<p>If we would see the vision of the new man, all the ordinances, rituals, different opinions, and all differences will be gone. Today in certain parts of this country the white people and black people cannot come together in one church, but if both the white brothers and the black brothers saw the new man, they would realize that both white and black have no place in the new man, but Christ is all and in all. In the same way, if Christians with differing practices see the new man, they will say that none of them has a place in this new man, but Christ is all and in all. Sometimes certain ones among us may not like the way the church is practiced in their locality, or perhaps they do not like the elders or some of the sisters. But if we all saw the new man, we would all realize that in the new man all these things have no place, and Christ is all and in all.<p>Such a vision will not only keep us in oneness, but also will deliver us and rescue us from all things other than Christ. We need such a vision. Throughout the years some have said in a narrow way that each local church must have its own jurisdiction and its own autonomy, but we need to see that all the local churches in the different countries are one new man.<p>Human culture began with two rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris, which formed the valley of Mesopotamia. Human culture then went on from these two rivers to the Mediterranean Sea. Before the time of Columbus, human culture was merely around the Mediterranean Sea, but from this sea, human culture expanded to the ocean. From Columbus until the time of the end of the second world war was the period of the culture of the oceans. The United States became and still is the leading country on this earth because it borders on the two oceans. The Atlantic and the Pacific are like the two wings of the &#8220;eagle.&#8221; For this reason the United States maintains a fleet in the Mediterranean to protect the Atlantic, and a fleet in the Far East to protect the Pacific. Since the second world war, however, human culture is not only a culture of the oceans but a culture of space.<p>According to history and according to the Bible, culture always goes along with God&#8217;s intention. Even though the fallen human culture is not of God, God is sovereign over all these things. God has brought human culture from the sea to the ocean and above the ocean to the skies for the purpose of perfecting the new man. Everything on this earth is for the perfection of the new man. Today with the world politics, scientific inventions, modern transportation and communication, and our understanding of languages, the world has been condensed into a small sphere. There is nearly no hindrance for the new man to be perfected. Today everything is ripe, ready, and prepared for the new man to come forth. We all have to see where we are. We are at the end time, and this is the most golden time. This is the right time for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Our view must be broadened. There is only one new man, and nothing and no one has any place in this new man, but Christ is all and in all.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AND THE ONENESS OF THE NEW MAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:14-15; 4:22-24; Col. 3:10-11; John 19:19-22</h1><h2 class=head1>A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING THE FOUR MAJOR EVENTS OF HISTORY</h2><p>Throughout all the centuries, God has been sovereign over human culture on the earth. The history of the human race is divided by the birth of Christ. Before Christ there were four thousand years, and after Christ until now there have been almost two thousand years. The incarnation of God in humanity became the very dividing line of human history. Although we can see God&#8217;s sovereignty over human culture in the first four thousand years, it is even more apparent in these last two thousand years.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Sovereignty for the Formation and Spread of the Gospel</h2><p>The rise of the Roman Empire was not an accident; it was sovereignly arranged by God&#8217;s authority. Only about thirty years before Christ was born, the Roman Empire was founded. The Roman Empire not only prepared the way for the spreading of the gospel, but it also helped in the formation of the gospel. The gospel was formed and accomplished by Christ&#8217;s death, and Christ&#8217;s death was through the crucifixion carried out by the Roman Empire. In this way the Roman Empire was used by God, not only for the spreading of the gospel, but also for the formation of the gospel. The professors in the universities know the historical facts, but they may not have this heavenly vision. We need to have the heavenly sight with which to see human history, not from the human point of view but from the divine point of view.<p>Western culture is composed and constituted with three elements: the Hebrew religion, the Greek culture and philosophy, and the Roman politics and law. When Pilate was executing the Lord Jesus by crucifying Him, he wrote a title above the cross in three languages-in Hebrew, representing the Hebrew religion; in Greek, representing the Greek philosophy, the Greek culture; and in Latin, representing Roman government, Roman politics, and Roman law (John 19:19-22). This signifies that the combined western culture helped in the formation of the gospel.<p>That these three languages were used together shows that the Roman Empire had been unified. It had unified the Jewish world, the Greek world, and the Roman world altogether into one empire. The known world first included Mesopotamia, the river culture, before the time of Abraham. When Abraham was called and moved to Canaan on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, culture went on from the two rivers to the sea. This may be called the sea culture. Then the Greeks came and under Alexander the Great invaded Palestine. Later, Julius Caesar conquered all the nations around the great sea and prepared the way for the Roman Empire. Jesus was born under the reign of the grandnephew and adopted son of Caesar-Augustus (Luke 2:1).<p>It was through God&#8217;s sovereignty that the Roman Empire was prepared for the purpose of the gospel. Firstly, God used the Roman Empire in the formation of the gospel, and afterwards, God used the Roman Empire for the spreading of the glad tidings. Within less than a half century the gospel was spread to &#8220;every nation under heaven&#8221; (Acts 2:5), the countries around the Mediterranean Sea. By the formation and propagation of the gospel the church was brought forth. Even after the decline of the church, it still had its center in Rome. Rome was the center of the &#8220;gospel world.&#8221; Although the Roman Empire was actually against God, it was unknowingly used by God for the formation and spreading of the gospel. We have to thank God for the Roman Empire. We need the heavenly view to see this.<h2 class=head2>The Reformation and the Discovery of the New Land</h2><p>Following the formation and spread of the gospel, the church declined until it fell into the Dark Ages. Then in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, God was sovereign over two great events-the reformation of the church and the discovery of the new land. These should be considered as the second major step in the history of the last two thousand years. These events first served to liberate the human mentality which had been imprisoned under Catholicism. Second, it was through these two accomplishments that the European culture was carried to other continents, including America and Asia. However, this culture was too much related to Catholicism. The spreading of the European culture was very much under the influence of Catholicism. This is the reason why the Central and South American countries are primarily Catholic. Wherever Catholicism went, there was darkness. Even today so many Central American and South American countries are still under the darkness of Catholicism.<h2 class=head2>The Raising Up of Great Britain for the Spread of the Gospel</h2><p>For fulfilling His purpose to spread the gospel to the whole world, God needed to defeat Spain. For this, God raised up Britain. From the time that the British navy defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, Britain became the leading power on the earth. Britain became Great Britain, and was called the nation without sunset, for throughout the whole earth there were British colonies. Great Britain maintained a peaceful order over the world for the spreading of the gospel in the way of Protestantism. By God&#8217;s sovereignty, world influence shifted from Catholicism to Protestantism. God raised up Britain for His purpose, to send His gospel to Asia, Africa, and many other places, without the dark influence of Catholicism. If China had been too much influenced by Catholicism, the Lord&#8217;s recovery could not have had such a start there. However, Christianity in China was not under Catholicism but under Protestantism. The pure situation there was used by God. By this it is clear that Britain was used by God for spreading the gospel to every corner of the world.<h2 class=head2>The Raising Up of the United States for the New Man</h2><p>By the beginning of this century the gospel had been spread to every corner of the earth. However, God&#8217;s purpose was not only gospel preaching but the perfection of the one new man. Britain was not so useful for this end, so through the two world wars, God somewhat put Britain down and raised up the United States. It was through the United States that these two wars were ended. The first world war was ended through the intervention of the United States, and in the second world war the United States was crucial in defeating the axis powers both in Europe and in Asia. All this happened under God&#8217;s sovereignty. Through these two wars the United States was raised up for the perfection of the new man. Today this country is at the geographic center, the crossroads, of the whole earth, and is like a giant eagle with the two biggest oceans as its two wings.<p>The Roman Empire was raised up for the formation and propagation of the gospel. Then Spain was raised up temporarily for the spreading of western culture, even though it was under the influence of Catholicism, which was unsuitable for God&#8217;s economy. Britain defeated Spain and became the leading power of the world for the spreading of the gospel to every corner of this earth. Fourth and last, the United States was raised up as the center of the inhabited earth for the purpose of the new man. This new man is not of any one race; it is of all the races. Because of this, one country had to be raised up by God in the very center of the populated earth.<p>The United States is not composed with a single race. It is a nation composed with many peoples, a &#8220;melting pot.&#8221; According to recent immigration laws, this country may receive 300,000 immigrants yearly-130,000 from the Western Hemisphere and another 170,000 from outside this hemisphere. Regardless of race or country of origin, anyone may apply for entry. Since the new immigration law, many thousands have come from China, Italy, Greece, the Philippines, India, and other nations.<p>Second, this country conducts much cultural exchange. The United States does not like to remain private; it shares many of its good things with other peoples. There are many exchange students in the United States for the blending of the human races. In this way the United States is working for God, and this country is being used by God. Also, in all of history there has never been such a country that helped other nations as this one does. Billions of dollars in American economic and military aid go out to many countries. Fourth, the American dollar is the standard among the world&#8217;s currencies. Neither German marks or Japanese yen are the standard today. Even in Japan, wealth is counted by the accumulation of American dollars. The whole world spends American money. By this we may realize the sovereignty of our Father for the purpose of the new man. All these things indicate that we are surely near the end of this age. If God perfects the new man at this time, there will be nothing more for Him to do in this age.<p>Geographically speaking, the Lord has raised up a country for His purpose in the very center of the whole inhabited earth. As an American citizen holding an American passport, you may travel throughout the whole world, in the same way that Paul, as a Jew with Roman citizenship, could travel throughout the Roman Empire (cf. Acts 22:25-29). When mainland China was lost to the Communists in 1949, I could not sleep or eat well. I was very sorrowful over the loss of that country and hundreds of churches. But now, since I have realized the situation today, I am happy that I am here in the United States. To be here is much better than to be in my hometown in mainland China. We all have to give thanks to the Lord that we are in the United States, in the center of the inhabited earth for the perfection of the new man that God intends to have in His economy.<p>Throughout all the centuries the Lord has blockaded Russia and confined it to the cold region. The Russian czars tried their best to get out of the Black Sea and into the Mediterranean, but God used Britain to close the outlet from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic. Russia tried as well to use the Suez Canal to get into the Indian Ocean, but God again used Britain and Egypt to close the way. Later, the czars attempted to build the Siberian railway to provide access to the Pacific Ocean, but were not able to. Instead, they invaded Manchuria, the territory of China, to get the right to build the Manchurian Railroad. The czars were happy because they had gained access to the Pacific, but they were later driven out of Manchuria in the Russo-Japanese War. Although today the Russian fleet is in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, they will still not have convenient access to the Suez Canal due to the relationship between Egypt and Israel. Our God has blockaded and confined Russia to the &#8220;refrigerator&#8221; in the north. He would not tolerate Russia gaining any part of the two major oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific. God is sovereign in keeping the world really free for the new man.<p>Now we are right in the center of the world. We must grasp the opportunity. Within a short time the new man will be perfected. To be a Christian in the Lord&#8217;s recovery for the new man is marvelous! We all have to forget about today&#8217;s religion and see the vision of the new man. God has done everything to bring all the peoples together, especially in the United States. Everything is for the new man.<h2 class=head1>THE ONENESS OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p>The new man is not a new organization or a new &#8220;United Nations.&#8221; This new man is just Christ-Christ spreading and Christ enlarged. Colossians 3:11 says, &#8220;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; All persons have no place in the new man; it is not another kind of United Nations. You have no place in the new man, and neither do I. We all have no place in the new man, but Christ is all and in all.<p>If you are not in Christ, you are through with this new man. If you are not in Christ you have no share, no part, in this new man. Even if you are in Christ, yet you do not live by Christ, you have a problem related to this new man. We may be American, Chinese, or Japanese, but we are not here living Americans, Chinese, or Japanese. We are here living Christ. Even if you are a typical Chinese, what is in you now is not Chinese; rather Christ is in you. Christ is our life, Christ is our nature, and Christ is our person.<p>Since we have such a Christ as our content, we do not merely need unity. The word unity is not so scriptural. Ephesians 4:3 refers to the oneness, not the unity, of the Spirit. Because Christ is one, He does not need to be united. Anything that is one does not need unity. Unity implies that before being united the various components were separated and divided. We do not have unity in this sense; rather we have oneness. Christ is not divided; Christ is only one.<p>The ecumenical movement in Christianity strives for unity. Any ecumenical movement is not according to the truth. Colossians 3:11 says that no one has any place in this new man, but in the unity of ecumenism everything and everyone is there. The monk has a place, the priest has a place, and everyone has a place there. Therefore, that is not the oneness, but the unity of the ecumenical movement. To be ecumenical is to include everything, to be universal, catholic. All manner of things and persons are united together. It is broad-minded, yet it is too broad. It includes too many things. The great harlot of Revelation 17, &#8220;The Mother of the Prostitutes&#8221; (v. 5), is the apostate Roman church, and the prostitutes, her daughters, should be all the different sects and groups in Christianity who hold to some extent the teaching, practices, and traditions of the apostate Roman church. The ecumenical movement is a situation where these &#8220;daughters&#8221; are going back to &#8220;the mother.&#8221; The pure church life has no evil transmitted from the apostate church.<p>The new man is not ecumenical. The new man is uniquely one, one with Christ and one in Christ. No one has any place in the new man, neither Jew, Greek, circumcision, uncircumcision, Scythian, barbarian, slave or free, but Christ is all and in all. We are not an ecumenical movement; we are in the new man. We are one not by our niceness, gentleness, or humility, but by and through Christ, because Christ is in you and Christ is in me. Christ is in all the brothers from China and all the brothers from Japan. We all have Christ, and Christ is our oneness. What we have is not a unity or an ecumenical movement. What we have is simply Christ. This does not mean that you tolerate me and I tolerate you, but that you have Christ and I have Christ. I love Him and you love Him; you live by Him and I live by Him. We all have Christ, so we are one in the unique Christ. If we do not have Christ and live Christ, we are through with the new man. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is not a movement. It is altogether the life of Christ, Christ as our life and our person. We all have to see this in a crystal clear way.<h2 class=head1>ONENESS IN THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2><p>However, this is still in the realm of doctrine. To have the practice of the new man we must know who Christ is and where Christ is. Christ today is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17) and He is in our spirit (Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). The life-giving Spirit, Christ, is now in our spirit, and these two spirits mingle together to form the spirit of the mind (Eph. 4:23). Ephesians 4:23 says that we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind. Our minds are being renewed through our realization that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is mingled with our human spirit.<p>It is uncommon today to hear a message concerning the mingled spirit or on being renewed in the spirit of the mind. Some who have never heard of the mingled spirit may teach that it is sufficient for us to read the Bible, win souls, and glorify God by our good behavior. However, Ephesians 4:23 is vital and crucial to us. The key to putting off the old man (4:22) and putting on the new man (4:24) is in being renewed in the spirit of our mind.<p>Brothers who live together could not always be happy with each other. In 1935 I was placed with some other co-workers who stayed together with me. After only two or three hours I became unhappy with one of them. Although I would have reacted in a wrong way, the Spirit within constrained me. Even when I was unable to be pleasant, the Spirit within me was able. We do have such a wonderful Spirit in our spirit. We are all one only because Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in our spirit. We love Him and we live by Him. When we live by Him, we are happy with all the brothers. After this incident, I praised the Lord and gave Him all the thanks for these wonderful co-workers. They all became lovely and pleasant to me because I was in the spirit.<p>It is in the spirit that we are one, and it is in the spirit that we are in the new man. The Lord desires to show His lovers that He does not care that we have anything but Himself. He is our life, He is our person, and He is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit. What He wants is that we would live by Him. In this we will have the oneness. In every nation there will be so many small groups living together by Christ. These will be the local churches which are composed into the new man. When the new man is brought into full existence, we will not speak of the differences between the churches or of the jurisdiction and autonomy of the local churches. At that time we will all be living Christ. Only Christ will be among us and only Christ will be manifested.<p>If you go to Brazil, you will see Christ. If you go to Britain, you will see Christ. If you go to Italy, France, Japan, China, Korea, or the Philippines, you will see nothing but Christ. There will be no need to say that we all are one-Christ will be each one of us. Christ is with you, Christ is with me, Christ is with every believer, and Christ is with every local church. There will be no need to merely speak about oneness. We will simply live out Christ. This will be the ultimate church life, a universal new man living out Christ. This will conclude this age, usher in the kingdom, and bring Christ back. Eventually this new man will become the loving bride to Christ. Some will take the ecumenical way, tolerating each other amidst many differences, but at the same time the Lord will be working out everything to gain the new man. All the saints in many countries throughout the world will speak the same thing (1 Cor. 1:10), the unique Christ. We will only speak Christ because we will be living Him out. He is our life, and He is our person. He is the life-giving Spirit within our spirit, and all the time, in everything, we are turning to our spirit and growing into this unique Christ.<p>What is here in the Lord&#8217;s recovery is nothing but Christ, and this Christ is all and in all. You cannot be an individual believer, and you cannot keep your local church separate from all the others. Today is the day to have a new man constituted with all the local churches, including all the saints as one in Christ, who is all and in all. This vision will rescue us from all things other than Christ. If you have seen this vision, you will count all things as refuse compared with Christ (Phil. 3:8). You could not care for anything other than Christ. As we all live Him out, we will see the perfection of the new man on the earth.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST-THE LIFE AND PERSON OF THE NEW MAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:10-13a; Rom. 15:5-6; Eph. 3:16, 17a, 19b; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11</h1><h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S INTENTION TO HAVE THE NEW MAN</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention in His New Testament economy is to have a new man to replace the old man. What the Lord has shown us is something new to our concept, but it is so clear in the New Testament. Ephesians 4:22-24 says, &#8220;That you have put off...the old man...and have put on the new man.&#8221; Such a view of the new man has been covered by our natural and religious concept. Even certain Bible translators, who were scholars, were veiled in their understanding by the natural and religious concept. The New American Standard Version says in Ephesians 4:24 that we need to put on &#8220;the new self.&#8221; To speak of the &#8220;new self&#8221; as being created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth is not proper, according to the context of Ephesians (cf. 2:15). However, in the natural concept of the translators there was not such a thing as to put off the old man and to put on the new man. They only knew of the old nature and the new self. We must drop the natural concepts which we picked up in our background; these become frustrations, veils, to our understanding of the Bible. We must be here with an unveiled face.<p>Ephesians 4:22 and 24 speak of the old man and the new man, but according to chapter two, verse 15 of the same book, the new man is corporate. Ephesians 2:15 says, &#8220;Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.&#8221; &#8220;The two&#8221; refers to two peoples, the Jewish people and the Gentile people. Of these two peoples, one new man was created. Surely this one new man is a corporate man. In the same principle, the old man must also be the corporate old man. We have to put off the corporate old man and put on the corporate new man. God&#8217;s intention is not merely that we be saved, learn to be spiritual, or even that we grow in Christ. It is also not merely that we have the proper church life, the local church established according to the New Testament economy. All these are proper, but God&#8217;s intention in His New Testament economy is to have a new man to replace the old man.<h2 class=head1>THE BRINGING FORTH OF THE NEW MAN IN THE END TIME</h2><p>Humanly speaking, according to the situation in the world and in Christianity today, it seems that it is not possible for God to have the one new man. It is possible for God to save many souls and for many Christians to attain to a certain level of spirituality. It is possible for us to have a proper church life according to the New Testament with elders and deacons, but do you believe that it is possible for God to have the one new man? Although we may see the vision that God desires to have a new man to replace the old man, when we view the situation around us, we may feel that it is not possible. Among the believers there are many negative, disappointing, and discouraging elements, and almost no genuine oneness. But I am fully convinced and have the full assurance that God will have the new man. Some day God will point to us and say, &#8220;Look at the new man, Satan. See My masterpiece, the new man.&#8221; According to the Bible, according to prophecy, and according to history, whatever God says becomes so. The Lord said that He would come quickly (Rev. 22:20), but with Him a thousand years is as one day (2 Pet. 3:8).<p>In the past two thousand years the Lord has accomplished so much, including the raising up of the Roman Empire, the reformation of Christianity, the discovery of the new land, the defeat of Spain by Britain, and the raising up of the United States. It is a great thing that such a country as America is right at the center of the inhabited earth. Five hundred years ago this entire continent was not yet discovered by the Europeans, but within such a short time this country has become the leading nation on earth. God has done this, and this is a strong confirmation to me. If there could be such a nation as this on this earth, I do believe that within a short time there will also be the new man. It is almost a miracle that such a country could be here. Who put this country here, and who selected its location at the center of the globe? If you have the vision that God has miraculously raised up such a country on this earth, then you must also believe that within a short time the new man will be on the earth.<p>The Lord&#8217;s recovery today is not an ordinary Christian work. Rather, it is something particular and uncommon. This is the space age. Human culture has come from the river to the sea, from the sea to the ocean, and from the ocean into space. After this, where shall human culture go? This space age is the end time. At this end time the Lord is going to bring forth the new man. The Lord today is going to raise up His believers throughout all the world, in so many countries, to seek after Him. When we seek after Him, we will see that what He wants is such a new man.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE LIFE AND PERSON OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p>The new man is not a movement, such as the ecumenical movement, and is not an organization but a man. As a man, the new man must have life and he must have a person. The life of this new man must be Christ, and the person of this new man must also be Christ. In this new man there is no place for anyone else. The Jew, the Greek, the circumcised, the uncircumcised, the barbarian, the Scythian, the slave, and the freeman all have no place, but Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11). For one to say that Christ is his life and Christ is his person is not good enough. We must say in the plural that Christ is our life and Christ is our person. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is here to bring forth the new man. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery the Lord does not care for a movement or an organization. What He has been doing, and what He is now doing, is bringing forth the new man with Himself as the life and person.<p>Many among us will pick up the burden to move to other localities to start the church life. This is marvelous. But at the same time, none of us should take this as an opportunity to be a leader. No doubt many leaders will be raised up because in every small church there should be some leading ones. But we should all be willing, once a church is established, to follow the Lord&#8217;s leading to go to still another place. We should not desire to be a leader, and we should not desire to have a &#8220;nation.&#8221; This is a great snare in Christianity. Every Christian denomination is a &#8220;nation.&#8221; Even every free group is a nation, an empire. In this situation there could never be the oneness. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, among all the local churches, there should be no &#8220;nations.&#8221; On the whole earth all the local churches are not &#8220;nations,&#8221; but one new man. If we have many &#8220;nations,&#8221; spontaneously there will be organization. But if we do not have such nations, we will be simply, singly, and uniquely the one new man. We do not care for the leadership, but we care to bear the burden. We do not care to have an empire, a little nation, in which we can be a little king. Rather, we are all in the one new man.<h2 class=head1>TAKING THE SUBJECTIVE CHRIST AS OUR LIFE AND OUR PERSON</h2><p>Practically, we all have to learn how to take Christ as our life and our person. This very Christ who is our life and our person is the life-giving Spirit. This is a crucial point. According to traditional teaching, Christ is merely objective and in the heavens to be worshipped, adored, and praised. However, according to the New Testament, our Christ is the life-giving Spirit, who indwells our spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:16). He is not merely objective but altogether subjective to us. He is the Spirit dwelling in our spirit, making our spirit one with Him. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; Today we are not simply worshipping an objective Christ in the third heavens. We are experiencing, enjoying, and partaking of a very subjective Christ who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. We all must learn to say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, since You are such a Spirit, I surrender myself and my all to You. I surrender all my knowledge, ordinances, practices, rituals, works, doings, and everything to You. I do not care for these things. Lord Jesus, I would simply take You as my life and my person. Lord Jesus, it is not I, but You who live in me. I do not like to do anything, be anything, or say anything that You would not do, be, or say. Lord Jesus, You are my life and You are my person.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>SPEAKING AND EXPRESSING THE SAME THING</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:10 says, &#8220;That you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.&#8221; Similarly, Romans 15:5-6 says, &#8220;Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus, that you may with one accord and with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; Years ago these verses bothered me. How could tens of thousands of believers speak the same thing with one mind and one mouth? Today I have the full assurance, not merely doctrinally but experientially, that we all can speak the same thing because the same thing which we speak is the all-inclusive Christ. What we speak is not concerning baptisms, head covering, or foot-washing. We speak one thing-the all-inclusive Christ and His church. If we only take Christ as our life and Christ as our person, spontaneously we will all speak the same thing. Then practically we will be the new man. When you go to another country, a saint there will meet you, speaking the same thing. Wherever you go on this earth, regardless of what kind of people or what kind of language is there, you will hear the same thing. We all can speak the same thing, and we can all be attuned in the same opinion. We would only have one concept, Christ and the church.<p>Many have been distracted from Christ to other things, including scriptural, fundamental, and so-called spiritual things. Many believers are fighting concerning certain ordinances. Some may oppose how we practice baptism without a formal ceremony. We should not be caught in the snare of opinions. God does not care for this. What God cares for is whether or not we live by Christ and take Christ as our person. We should forget about all the opinions, and simply take Christ as our life and our person. Spend your time, your energy, and your being on Christ, and let others have their freedom.<p>Wherever we go we should not care for a way, an ordinance, or a ritual. We only care for Christ being ministered to us and our ministering something of Christ to others. The churches will progress in the divine life to such an extent that eventually we all will be absolutely the same. This means that we all will be reduced to taking our dear Lord Jesus as our life and as our person. We do not care for long hair or for short hair, but eventually we will all be the same, even in our cutting of our hair. A brother will know how long his hair should be, not by following another brother, but by fellowshipping with Christ who is his life. The day will come in which all the tribes, races, peoples, nations, and languages, the tens of thousands of believers, will all be the same, not by teaching, regulation, or ordinances, but by taking our living Christ as our life and as our person. We will express the same thing, we will speak the same thing, and we will have one mind and one mouth, glorifying our God and Father. This will be the time in which the new man will be perfected throughout the entire earth, and we will usher in God&#8217;s kingdom to bring Christ back. Then Christ will set up His kingdom on this earth. We will be there with Him to rule over the earth to express our Father, the very God, and to exercise His dominion. This is the new man replacing the old one. This is not a movement, this is not an organization, and this is not a denomination or a sect. This is the living of such a new man.<h2 class=head1>THE NEW MAN AS THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2><p>We as the new man will bear the image of our Father who created us. The invisible God has a visible image. The image of God is not physical; it is visible yet intangible. Our physical body is visible and tangible, but besides our physical form we have an image. This image may be considered as a composition of our human virtues. As human beings we may be kind, loving, and righteous. These virtues constitute our intangible but visible image. As a physical person we have two images; one is the physical image, and the other is the intangible, but visible image.<p>God, as the divine Being, has His virtues. Through the Ten Commandments, God revealed Himself as the righteous God, as the holy God, as the loving God, and as the God full of light. Righteousness, holiness, love, and light are God&#8217;s divine virtues which constitute the image of God. Ephesians 4:24 says that the new man &#8220;according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth,&#8221; while Colossians 3:10 says that the new man &#8220;is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.&#8221; The image of God in Colossians 3:10 is the righteousness and holiness of the truth in Ephesians 4:24. Christ is the image of God and He is the very embodiment of God (Col. 1:15). Colossians 2:9 says, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; Christ bears the image of God and expresses God. What He expressed of God was mainly righteousness, holiness, love, and light. When He was on this earth, He was a Man who was righteous, holy, loving, and full of light. This was God&#8217;s image expressed in a man.<p>Today as the new man the church bears the image of God, that is, God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, love, and light. If we would drop all the things we picked up from our background and come back to this one Person, the living One, Jesus Christ, taking Him as our life and our person, day by day we will express righteousness, holiness, love, and light. We do not need to try to be righteous and holy, or to love others. Neither do we need to try to enlighten others. As long as we live Christ out, taking Him as our person, we are expressing righteousness, holiness, love, and light. This is the expression of God. All the fullness of God is embodied in Christ, and this Christ is wrought into our being to be our righteousness, our holiness, our love, and our light. This is the new man with the new man&#8217;s expression. Such a new man with such an expression will usher in the kingdom of God and will bring Christ, the King, back to this earth. The goal of the Lord&#8217;s recovery is to become such a new man which is the very expression of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WAY THE NEW MAN COMES INTO EXISTENCE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:14-16; 4:22-24; Col. 3:10-11; Gal. 3:27-28; 1 Cor. 12:13; 1:10; Rom. 15:5-6; 12:2</h1><h2 class=head1>THE CREATION AND EXISTENCE OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h2><p>After everything in the universe had been prepared by God within six days, God created man in His own image (Gen. 1:26). God&#8217;s intention was to be expressed through this man, and this man is not an individual, but a corporate man. God needs a corporate man to be a corporate vessel to contain Him and to express Him. This is clearly revealed in the holy Word.<p>God created such a man, but this man fell into the hand of Satan, the enemy of God. As a result, man was divided and scattered. He was no longer a complete and perfect corporate vessel to God. Rather, this corporate vessel was shattered into pieces mainly by racial differences. Man was divided according to his families, his languages, and according to his land into many nations (Gen. 10:5, 20, 31-32). Thus, man became old in the eyes of God. Anything that becomes old in God&#8217;s eyes is through with His purpose. In other words, the man created by God to fulfill His purpose was absolutely destroyed, thus becoming useless in the hands of God. But in the Bible we can see one principle-no one can stop God&#8217;s intention. God would not change His mind related to His purpose. Since He has made up His mind, He will surely get what He desires.<p>Man became a failure, but because God would not give up His original intention, He came to be a man (John 1:1, 14). This Man, who is God incarnated, is called in the Bible the second Man (1 Cor. 15:47). He lived on this earth and died an all-inclusive death on the cross to deal with every negative thing in the universe. He was willing to die on the cross, and He had no choice but to die for the carrying out of His intention. His death for our redemption took away sin and sins (John 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:3), crucified our old man and the entire old creation (Rom. 6:6; Col. 1:20), and destroyed Satan and judged the world (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31). Ephesians 2:14-15 tells us that Christ dealt with another negative item. In His death on the cross He abolished the enmity between the races, the forms or ways of living and worship, the ordinances. The different ways of living or ordinances became a strong enmity between the races, especially between the Jews and the Gentiles. Christ has abolished sins, sin, the old man including the flesh and the self, the entire old creation, Satan and the world, and also the ordinances that divide the human race.<p>God&#8217;s purpose cannot be fulfilled simply by taking away sin and sins, releasing us from our old man, liberating us from Satan, and sanctifying us by separating us from the world. God&#8217;s purpose can only be fulfilled by a man. God needs a man. On the cross Christ not only accomplished redemption, release, liberation, and sanctification, but He also created one new man of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles. To do this He needed to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances.<p>Ordinances are mainly the ways of living. Each culture on this earth has its own way to live. Every race is proud of its way of living. All the different ordinances existing among the human race are dividing factors. We have to realize the good news that Christ through His death on the cross abolished all the ordinances. The Bible calls these ordinances &#8220;the enmity&#8221; (Eph. 2:14). History has proven that Germany, France, and Britain could never be one. The different ways of living among the races on this earth have made it impossible for man to be one. But the good news is that all these differences have been abolished on the cross. Even the differences, the enmity, between China and Japan have been crossed out. This is a part of the perfect and complete gospel. Not only our sin, sins, our old man, Satan, and the world have been dealt with, but also all the different ways of living among the nations have been abolished on the cross. Christ did this in order to create of the two peoples one new man.<p>God created the one new man on the cross, but practically speaking this one new man has not come into existence. Our redemption was accomplished on the cross before we were born, but according to our experience, redemption was not realized by us until we repented and believed in the One who died for us. Until we believed in the Lord Jesus, redemption did not come into existence with us in our experience. This is the principle of the New Testament economy. Christ accomplished so much on the cross, including the creation of the one new man, yet many of these things have still not come into existence in our experience. In this chapter we want to see the steps that need to be accomplished for the new man to come into existence.<h2 class=head1>THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p>The baptism in the Spirit is the first step needed for the one new man, which has already been created, to come into existence. The creation of the one new man was accomplished on the cross prior to the day of Pentecost. Ephesians 2:15 makes this point very clear. But that was the creation of the new man, not the existence of the one new man with us. For the one new man to come into existence with us, there is the need of the baptism in the Spirit. After Christ created the one new man, He was resurrected from the dead. Then He ascended into heaven and was enthroned there, being made the Lord of all (Acts 2:36; 10:36), not only with His divinity but also with His humanity. After His ascension, there is a Man in the heavens as the Lord of all (Acts 7:56; 10:36). On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius He poured Himself out upon God&#8217;s chosen ones (Acts 2:4; 10:44). That was the baptism in the Spirit.<p>First Corinthians 12:13 says, &#8220;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&#8221; As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, be this one Body. Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. It is in this one Spirit that we were all baptized into this one living Body to express Christ.<p>The Jews, the Greeks, the slaves, and the free have all been put into the one Spirit. Before this baptism all the differences between the races and the ranks in human society still existed. But through the baptism in the Spirit these different peoples were put into the one Spirit. We may have seen that our baptism into Christ Jesus was also our burial with Him into death (Rom. 6:3-4), but we need to see also that it was not only we ourselves that were buried. Our race, our rank in society, our natural background, and our natural position were all buried when we were baptized in the Spirit. The new man was created on the cross, but for the new man to come into existence there is the need of the baptism in the Spirit, which is to baptize the Jews, the Greeks, the slaves, and the free in one Spirit into one Body.<p>We may talk about the Body, yet the Body may only be a term to us. Have we ever seen the Body? As long as the racial differences, the different ways of living, exist with us, there is no Body. To have the Body in experience, we must trade in our racial backgrounds. Through the baptism in the Spirit all of us become one Body, and our races, nationalities, and social ranks are over.<h2 class=head1>DRINKING THE ONE SPIRIT</h2><p>The second way that the new man comes into existence is also in 1 Corinthians 12:13. After being baptized into one Body, we were all given to drink one Spirit. The baptism in the Spirit was the first step for the created new man to come into existence. Now our drinking of the one Spirit is the second step. The baptism in the Holy Spirit has already been accomplished. The verb in 1 Corinthians 12:13 is in the past tense-&#8220;were all baptized.&#8221; The baptism of the whole Body of Christ in the Holy Spirit is something which is already accomplished and still exists. This baptism was accomplished on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius upon the Body of Christ. The baptism in the Holy Spirit is ours because we are members of this baptized Body. Many times when I speak, I get excited in the Lord because I am in the baptism in the Holy Spirit. We are enjoying the baptism in the Spirit and we are in the Spirit, but to drink of the Spirit is another matter. We all were baptized in one Spirit, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. Baptism is to put us into the water; then after being baptized, we have to get the water into us continuously all the time.<p>The Chinese who lived around Nanking and Shanghai along the Yangtze River had a slogan. They said that in the evening they had the practice of getting themselves enveloped in water. This meant that they took a bath and became immersed in water. Then in the morning their skin needed to envelop the water. This meant that they needed to drink much tea to get filled with water inwardly. In order to be healthy, in the evening the water should envelop the skin, and in the morning the skin should envelop the water. They said that if you would do this every day, you would be a most healthy person. To be baptized is to have the water enveloping us. To drink is for us to envelop the water. This means we have the water without and within. For the created one new man to come into existence there is the need of these two steps-to become enveloped in water and to envelop the water. If a person were to stay in a bathtub full of water for thirty days and never drink any water, he would be in serious trouble. This shows how much we need to drink. Medical doctors will tell you that it is healthy to drink much water every day.<p>To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and be lost in Him; to drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and have our being saturated with Him. By these two procedures we are mingled with the Spirit. To be baptized in the Spirit is the initiation of the mingling and is once for all. To drink the Spirit is the continuation and accomplishment of the mingling and is perpetual, forever. We should drink of the Spirit daily and even hourly.<h2 class=head1>BEING RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR MIND</h2><p>The third step for the created new man to come into existence is that he needs to be renewed (Col. 3:10). As long as we have the baptism in the Spirit and the constant drinking, we will also have a thorough renewal. Whatever we drink saturates, refreshes, and renews our physical body. In like manner, when we drink the Spirit, He saturates every part of our inner being. Just to have the baptism in the Spirit is not adequate. We need the inward saturation, so we need to drink of the Spirit. If we drink of the Spirit, we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind (Eph. 4:23). We do not just need an outward baptism, but an inward, constant, and instant drinking of the Spirit into our very inward being. When we drink of the one Spirit, this Spirit saturates our inward being. The leading and central part of our inward being is the mind. Thus, when the Spirit has been drunk into us, it first saturates our mind.<p>When the Spirit spreads into our mind, it becomes the spirit of our mind. It is in such a Spirit that we are renewed for our transformation. The Spirit renews, reconstructs, rearranges our mind. Man is absolutely under the control and direction of his mind. What his mind thinks, he does. What his mind thinks, he follows. What his mind thinks, he carries out. The director of our being is our mind. Even after you have been regenerated and are loving the Lord, you are still under the direction of your mind.<p>Since we were born, we were always taught, raised up, and educated to be in our mind. Our being raised up, our education, and our makeup are altogether a matter in our mind. All the schools are intent on building up our mind. The classes in schools have nothing to do with building up our spirit. This kind of natural education builds up the mind mostly according to the different races. Different domestic teachings build up different racial characters. If you were born and raised up in Germany, you will have a German mentality. If you were born and raised up in China, you will have a Chinese mentality. It is so hard to pass on the gospel to those of the Arab culture because of the way they were raised up and educated. When the missionaries first went to China, it was hard for them to change the mentality of the Chinese. It was not so hard to tell the Chinese that they were sinners and that they needed the Lord Jesus. But if you touch the mentality of the Chinese, you are in danger of becoming their enemy. Even in the United States there are many different cultures with many different mentalities. With all these different mentalities, how could we practically have the new man? The Americans are noted for their quick disposition, while the Chinese are very considerate and cautious in what they do. The British are noted for their politics, their &#8220;politeness.&#8221; This is why all the members need to be renewed.<p>We need to drink of the one Spirit so that the Spirit can saturate our mind. The renewal of the mind is for the real practice of the new man. The British, the Chinese, and the Americans all have different ordinances related to their culture. This is why we need to have our national mentality renewed. Our national and even natural mentality was educated and built up according to our racial and cultural background. This is the top hindrance to the existence of the new man. Brother Hudson Taylor went to China with a burden to bring the gospel to the Chinese. He was so burdened that he even dressed the way the Chinese did. This was very commendable, but we must go further to see that it is necessary to be renewed in our mentality. Merely to change in an outward way could be a kind of performance and not the renewal in our mind.<p>We have seen that in this modern age the entire earth has become small. We believe that this is the age for the new man to be perfected and to come into existence in a full way. The Lord has arranged the outward environment and situation for the new man to come into being, but the outward situation has to match the inward reality. There is the need of the inward reality in the members of the Body of Christ. Due to the scientific inventions and the political situations on this earth, the many nationalities and cultures have been brought together. Now there is the need of the inward reality, which is the renewal of our mind. Our national, racial mentality which has been built up through our entire life must be renewed.<p>From the very first day that I came to the United States, the Lord showed me that I had to give up my Chinese mentality. I wanted a mind that only cared for the Lord&#8217;s recovery and not for my Chinese way of living. We need the Lord&#8217;s mercy and grace for Him to renew our mind. The Lord is going to perform something to bring this one new man into full existence. The Lord is going to do such a marvelous thing with all different cultures and races. The tendency of this age is pointed toward the Lord&#8217;s work for the one new man. But in order for this to happen we must have a thorough, proper, and adequate renewal of our mind which has been built up by our nationality. This is why we have to drink of the Spirit. Then our entire being, especially our mind, will be saturated by the Spirit.<p>In America the young people are trained and educated to act independently and also to be ambitious to attain to the highest position. This may be good for the United States, but this is absolutely not good for the new man. I have seen a number of American brothers who desired to be leaders in the church. If some are not elders, at least they would like to be service group leaders. This kind of mentality tears down the new man. We need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind for the new man. For the new man to come into full existence there is the need of a situation or condition where no one desires to be a leader. On the other hand, everyone should be fully burdened for the building up of the church. We should have the attitude that we would spend and be utterly spent for the building up of the church in our locality but have no ambition or desire to be a leader there. If the real situation needs you to take the lead, that is not up to you. That is up to the Lord according to the situation and the need. We all should desire to bear the burden to meet the Lord&#8217;s need and not care for rank or position.<p>We should have the attitude that if we are needed for a certain burden today, we want to bear it. After two months, it may be that there is someone more qualified and capable to bear this burden. Our attitude should be that this brother should replace us to bear this particular burden. You may not need to be an elder because there is someone who could bear the burden for the church in this capacity better than you. Two years ago you might have been the best one to bear a certain burden, but after two years there may be someone who has been raised up by the Lord to bear this burden in a more capable and excellent way. You should have the attitude that this is the Lord&#8217;s recovery and that the burden you are bearing is not your position. We all want to see the Lord go on in His recovery and all the members functioning in the Body according to His pleasure. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery it is a shame to have any thought concerning position. We need a real renewal.<p>Our mind needs to be renewed not just for our spiritual conduct, but for the very existence of the new man. We need to be baptized, we need to drink of the one Spirit, and we need to be saturated with the Spirit in our mind that we may have a full renewal in our mentality. We need to be renewed until all the cultural and natural makeup is over. Colossians 3:10 tells us that the new man is &#8220;being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.&#8221; Because the new man was created with us, who belong to the old creation (Eph. 2:15), he needs to be renewed. This renewing takes place mainly in our mind, as indicated by the phrase &#8220;unto full knowledge.&#8221; The new man has been created in our spirit and is being renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to Christ who is the image, the expression of God. Such a mind influences our emotion to love the Lord, and the loving emotion effects our will to choose the Lord.<p>Colossians 3:11 goes on to tell us that in the new man &#8220;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person. In the new man there is only room for Christ. He is all the members of the new man and in all the members. He is everything in the new man. Actually He is the new man, His Body (1 Cor. 12:12). In the new man He is the centrality and universality.<p>The only possibility of the Lord&#8217;s eternal purpose being fulfilled in this age is that we would all be willing to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. This means that we have to open up ourselves and drink of the Spirit that the Spirit may get into our being, saturating our natural mentality so that we can have a metabolic change in our way of life. Then there is much possibility for the new man to come into full existence.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RENEWAL OF THE MIND FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:14-15; 4:22-24; Gal. 3:27-28; 1 Cor. 12:13; Col. 3:10-11; Rom. 12:2; 15:5-6; 1 Cor. 1:10, 13a</h1><p>Every truth in the Bible has two aspects. It is the same with the one new man. The first aspect concerning this one new man is that Christ through His death on the cross in the flesh has completed the creation of this one new man. Ephesians 2:15 is one verse in the whole Bible which is so strong to tell us that this one new man has been created- &#8220;Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.&#8221; In the eyes of God, the one new man was created two thousand years ago on the cross, in Christ, of two peoples-the Jews and the Gentiles. Ephesians 2:15 covers nearly every aspect of this one new man, yet this verse still leaves out a major point. This major point is the existence of the one new man. The creation of the one new man was completed on the cross, but before Pentecost this one new man had still not come into existence. The existence of the one new man began on the day of Pentecost, but that was not the completion. That was the beginning of the existence of the one new man. Even today the existence of the new man is still going on to be perfected.<p>Due to the degradation of the church and due to many frustrations from the natural, fallen, and religious mind through the nearly two thousand years of church history, the existence of the one new man has not been realized to a full extent. Where is this one new man today? The vision of this one new man has been nearly missed. Some teachers have said that this new man is the reborn new nature. I was taught in this way, and I believed it. One day the Lord showed me that this one new man could not be our regenerated new nature because it is a man created of two peoples. It is not only a man but also a corporate man. Christ on the cross created this one corporate man. In this chapter we want to see something further concerning how the existence of this created one new man can be realized.<h2 class=head1>THE BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p>In the last chapter we saw that the first step needed for the existence of the one new man is the baptism in the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4) and in the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:34-48), Christ as the Head of the Body baptized all the members in one Spirit into one Body. First Corinthians 12:13 says that we were all baptized into one Body. This verse refers to Jews, Greeks, slaves, and free. These are different races and different ranks in society. All the different races and people with all different ranks have been put into the Spirit that they all may be one Body.<p>God&#8217;s chosen people are not only from one race. Revelation 5:9 tells us that Christ has purchased to God by His blood &#8220;men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation.&#8221; On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, Christ as the Head of the Body put all these chosen and called ones into one Body. This was the first step needed for the existence of the one new man, which had already been created on the cross. We just need to accept this divine fact by faith. The accomplishment of this first step is included in the perfect and all-inclusive gospel. This gospel includes the baptism in the Spirit by the Head, Christ. Christ has accomplished incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and the baptism of His many members in one Spirit into one Body.<h2 class=head1>DRINKING ONE SPIRIT</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:13 also tells us that we were all given to drink one Spirit. The baptism in the Spirit was accomplished once for all, but the daily drinking of the one Spirit is still going on. We need to drink of the one Spirit day by day and hour by hour. We should thank the Lord that He has accomplished the first step. Now we have to carry out the second step by drinking of the Spirit.<p>Spiritual things are very mysterious and abstract. This is why it helps to have something physical as an illustration. I drink a great amount of water every day. Every morning after I arise, the first thing I do is to drink a cup of water. At breakfast I drink three cups of water. Then around 10:30 a.m. I take a break and have another cup of water. At lunch time I take two cups of water. Around 3:30 p.m. I also drink one cup of water. At dinnertime I drink two cups and before going to bed I drink one cup. I drink about twelve cups of water daily with little fluctuation. This drinking of water is good for my health. This is an illustration of my spiritual drinking. We need to drink spiritually in the same way. Some of the saints are frustrated in their spiritual drinking. Their drinking of the Spirit fluctuates. At times they will drink a lot and at other times they will not drink for a week. If our drinking of the Spirit is inconsistent and irregular, we cannot have a healthy spiritual situation. Without drinking, it is hard to be healthy. The more that we drink, the more we bring in the existence of the one new man.<h2 class=head1>PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN BY BEING RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR MIND</h2><p>Ephesians 2:15 tells us that the new man was created on the cross, yet Ephesians 4:22 tells us that we have to put off the old man. Because the new man in Ephesians is corporate, the old man, in the same principle, must also be a corporate man. We need to put off the old man, not by being taught, corrected, trained, educated, or instructed but by being renewed in the spirit of our mind (4:23). When we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind, we do not only put off the old man but also put on the new man &#8220;which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth&#8221; (4:24). The one new man was created in Christ, but on you nothing of the new man may exist. Thus, we have to put on, to wear, the new man which has already been created in Christ. The way we put on the new man is by being renewed in the spirit of our mind.<p>Man is a tripartite being, composed of spirit and soul and body (1 Thes. 5:23). The soul is composed of the mind (Psa. 13:2; 139:14; Lam. 3:20), the emotion (1 Sam. 18:1; 2 Sam. 5:8; Psa. 86:4), and the will (Job 7:15; 6:7; 1 Chron. 22:19). When we were regenerated, the Spirit of God came into our spirit. Romans 8:16 tells us that the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God. This verse strongly testifies that the regenerating Spirit indwells our spirit. The divine Spirit dwells in our human spirit and now &#8220;he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17). This indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. The more that we pray, fellowship with the Lord, call on His dear name, and open our entire being to Him, the more such a mingled spirit spreads into our mind, thus becoming the spirit of our mind. It is in such a spirit that we are renewed for our transformation.<h2 class=head1>BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT BY DRINKING THE SPIRIT  FOR THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</h2><p>Ephesians 5:18 tells us to be filled in spirit. To be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, whereas to be filled in the spirit (our regenerated spirit, not God&#8217;s Spirit) is to be filled with Christ (Eph. 1:23) unto the fullness of God (3:19). The Lord wants to spread from our spirit first into our mind and then into our emotion and will. Our regenerated spirit mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God spreads into our mind. It is in this mingled spirit of our mind that we are renewed. To drink of the Spirit is to open ourselves to the Lord by praying to Him, calling upon His name, and fellowshipping with Him. The Spirit of God today is the drinking water. The more we drink of the Spirit, the more He fills us with Himself, and the more He saturates our mind to renew it for transformation.<h2 class=head1>THE RENEWING OF THE MIND FOR THE ONE NEW MAN</h2><p>When I was a young believer I thought that the renewing in the spirit of our mind was just for our Christian behavior. We can get our mind renewed by allowing it to be filled, possessed, and taken over by the Spirit of God. We have to pray, to fellowship with the Lord, to call on His name, and even to make a thorough confession of our sins. Then we will be transformed, and our behavior will be changed. Although this is true, the focal point of being renewed in the spirit of our mind is for the one new man.<p>Colossians 3:10-11 tells us that we need to &#8220;put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him; where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; In the new man Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, and freeman have no place. The renewal is not merely for our behavior. The renewal is even more to get rid of our racial ordinances and to get rid of the natural persons. Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person. In the new man there is only room for Christ. The new man is not Chinese, Japanese, French, English, German, or American. The new man is Christ. Christ is all and in all with the new man. In the new man there cannot be any Jew or Greek. There cannot be any Chinese or any Japanese. In the new man there cannot be any white or any black. We all need to be renewed for the existence of the one new man.<p>In Colossians 3:10 are the creation of the new man and his renewal. The creation was completed on the cross, but the renewal needs to go on. We need to have our mind renewed for the existence of the new man. God has created the new man, but the new man has not fully come into existence because of our unrenewed mind. Our mind is the problem. By God&#8217;s sovereignty I have been in many countries and have seen many different ordinances, many different ways of living. For people from different races and cultures to get saved is much easier than being renewed concerning their way of living. The ordinances in Japan are absolutely different from the ordinances in the United States. Everywhere I traveled I had to adjust to the particular ordinances of the people I visited. These different ordinances usually create a problem for us because our mind needs more renewing.<p>We all have to realize that God created one corporate man. God needed that man to fulfill His heart&#8217;s desire, but man fell and became divided and scattered. By being divided and scattered, man became useless in the hands of God. Look at today&#8217;s situation. The whole world is a divided and scattered world. In nearly every session of the United Nations, there is debating and even fighting. The real situation of the world is that the nations of this earth are not united but divided. In every level of society there is division. Today on this earth division is everywhere.<p>Romans 12:2 exhorts us not to be conformed to this age. This does not only mean that we should not be worldly in our dress and our way of living. To not be conformed to this age means even more that we should not follow the way of divisions. Romans 12:2 and Ephesians 4:23 are concerning the matter of renewing, and both verses are for the Body life. Romans 12:2 says, &#8220;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is.&#8221; If you look into the context of Romans 12, you can see that the will of God is to have the Body. The renewing of the mind is for the Body life. The problems in the Body life are related to the different ordinances.<p>Paul was all-inclusive when he listed the types of natural persons for which there is no room in the new man. Greeks are for philosophical wisdom; the Jews, for miraculous signs (1 Cor. 1:22). Circumcision refers to the observers of the Jewish religious rituals; uncircumcision to those who do not care for the Jewish religion. A barbarian is an uncultured person. Scythians were considered the most barbarous. A slave was one who had been sold into slavery, and a freeman was one who was free from slavery. Christians today have been divided by race, by nationality, by language, and also by religious matters. Some Christians are for baptism by immersion, while others are for sprinkling. This is no different than being for circumcision or uncircumcision. Religious matters can divide Christians. Others have divided over the way a Christian meeting should be held. Religious opinions always divide the members of the Body.<p>We need to be renewed in our natural mind, which means that our mind needs to be filled up and saturated with the Spirit. The Spirit needs to permeate every fiber of our mentality. According to our natural concept, the worship of God should be very quiet and solemn. Even the Moslems and the Hindus will agree with this concept. But when the Lord was entering into Jerusalem, &#8220;all the multitude of the disciples began, as they were rejoicing, to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen, saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&#8221; (Luke 19:37-38). When some of the Pharisees heard the disciples praising the Lord with a loud voice in such a way, they asked the Lord to rebuke them (v. 39). The Lord responded to them, &#8220;I tell you, if these shall be silent, the stones will cry out!&#8221; (v. 40). The worship from the disciples in this particular passage was not something quiet and solemn but loud and rejoicing.<p>One day Brother Watchman Nee and I went to a Pentecostal meeting where the people were jumping, rolling, laughing, crying, and shouting. This meeting was too wild. All Brother Nee said to me concerning the meeting was that in the New Testament we are not told the way to meet. Brother Nee was not for such a wild meeting, but he was even the more against the deadness evidenced in many other Christian meetings.<p>We must see that in the new man there is no place for religious ordinances. When we began to meet in the early sixties in Los Angeles to have the church life, some people complained to me that in our meetings we did not have the gifts. I told them that our meetings were full of the gifts. First Corinthians 12 tells us that the top gift to the church is the word of wisdom and the second is the word of knowledge (v. 8). Another dear brother who loved the Lord very much came to me and said that he appreciated our meetings. His only problem was that he could not tolerate the sisters speaking in the meetings. He highly appraised me for my knowledge of the Bible, but he said I was mistaken in allowing the sisters to speak in the meeting. I asked him whether or not the sisters sang hymns in the meetings that he attended. When he responded that they did, I told him that even in his meetings the sisters were not silent because they sang the hymns. According to the truth of the Scriptures, women can pray and prophesy in the meetings (1 Cor. 11:5), but they are not permitted to teach as an authority, defining doctrine (1 Tim. 2:12).<p>These examples will help to show us that religious matters can divide Christians. One particular group was even divided over whether to have a piano or an organ in their meetings. Eventually one group was a piano assembly, and the other group was an organ assembly. All these are in the same category as circumcision and uncircumcision, religious or nonreligious. I am not for a piano assembly or for an organ assembly. I am for the new man.<p>We need to be renewed in our mind not just for our personal, ethical behavior, but for the one new man. Many Christians today still hold on to their natural, religious, and individual concepts because they will not let the Spirit spread into their mind. They do not let the Spirit take over their mind. We all need to open ourselves up to the Lord and pray, &#8220;Lord, I am here. I want my mind to be fully opened to You. Come in and fill me up. Permeate, saturate, and possess my entire inward being.&#8221; I believe if we would pray to the Lord in such a way, the Spirit would have a way to permeate our mind. When the Spirit permeates our mind, the ordinances are over. When the Spirit has possessed and saturated our mind, we will not care for black, white, Chinese, Japanese, American, British, German, French, Italian, or Spanish. We will not care whether the meeting is noisy or quiet. We will only care for the one new man.<p>By the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty, due to this modern scientific age and the political situation, the globe has been made small. Many different peoples have been brought together. This is the Lord&#8217;s doing. Despite the Lord&#8217;s bringing so many cultures and races together, there is still so much division in religion. In the United States, it is possible to see a Chinese Presbyterian Church and a Korean Presbyterian Church. It is also possible to see the Anglican Church in the United States. We must realize, however, that the church is the new man. Even though in this modern era so many races and peoples have been brought together, people still like to keep themselves divided. To keep ourselves divided from other Christians because of religious ordinances is to be conformed to this age because this age is one of division. To cause division is to be conformed to this age. We need to interpret Romans 12:2 in the way of not being conformed to this age of division. We Christians are one. Whether we are American, British, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, or Japanese, the Lord has made us one. No natural person has any place in the one new man.<p>The only way the one new man can be realized practically is by our minds being renewed. The one new man cannot be realized by our being corrected or taught but by the Spirit of God permeating our mentality. When the element of God gets into our mentality, we will think as He thinks; we will see things the way He does; and we will consider the situation as He does. It is then that the one new man will come into existence. There will be no races, no social ranks, and no religious differences. Christ will truly be all and in all. I believe that this is the up-to-date vision of the Lord&#8217;s move on this earth. The Lord is moving on to get the one new man.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S MOVE TO USHER IN THE PRACTICAL EXISTENCE OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p>The Lord prophesied in Matthew 16:18 that He would build His church. Whatever the Lord has prophesied must be fulfilled. Without the practical existence of the new man, the building up of the church may be vain talk. The building of the church depends upon the existence of the new man. If the new man comes into existence, no doubt, the builded church is here. Regardless of the present situation of division, the Lord is going to get the new man. Everything that the Lord is doing in this present age is to usher in the practical existence of the one new man. To drop our natural, religious concepts, our mind needs to be saturated, permeated, possessed, and taken over by our mingled spirit. Then our concepts will be fully revolutionized and we will no longer have any ordinances. The new man will then come into existence. This is the Lord&#8217;s move on the earth today.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RENEWING OF OUR MIND IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:14-15; 4:22-24; Rom. 12:2; Acts 10:9-20; Rev. 5:9-10</h1><h2 class=head1>THE GOAL OF GOD&#8217;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2><p>The goal of God&#8217;s New Testament economy is to gain the new man. The old man failed God, so in His New Testament economy God is going to get a new man. For this purpose Christ died on the cross not only to take away our sins, to crucify our old man, to destroy Satan, and to judge the world, but also to abolish the ordinances, the different ways of living among different peoples, so that He could create in Himself a new man. All the different ways of living and worship were abolished on the cross. We may have realized that sin, sins, the old man, Satan, and the world have been dealt with by Christ on the cross. But not many of us have ever been taught that on the cross Christ has abolished all the ordinances of human living. The Jews, the Greeks, the Japanese, the Chinese, the French, and the British all have their ordinances, their particular ways of living. The British, the Germans, and the French are Europeans, but their ways of living are entirely different, and world history shows us that they have always been fighting with one another.<p>In 1958 I traveled throughout Europe and visited nearly all the leading nations. When I stayed in England some sisters told me that the British way is the best way to cook fresh, green vegetables. They liked to boil their vegetables until they were very soft. When I went to Denmark, some sisters there told me that their way to cook vegetables was the best. They did not boil their green vegetables into such a soft condition as the British did. This shows us that even in a small matter like cooking green vegetables, the British and the Danish could not be one. These particular sisters were separated by their cooking ordinances. The Chinese and the Japanese would have a hard time accepting one another&#8217;s cooking. All different cultures have their particular way to cook, which is related to their way of living, to their ordinances. But we need to praise the Lord that we have heard the good news that Christ on the cross has abolished all the ordinances.<p>Ordinances do not only create problems between the saints but also between a husband and a wife. A sister from Peking might marry a brother who is Cantonese. After the marriage, they may quarrel over the different types of cooking. The husband may not like the kind of cooking from Northern China, and the sister may not like Cantonese cooking. Our mind needs to be renewed to realize that Christ has abolished all the ordinances, not for us to be forgiven or redeemed, but in order to create in Himself, of two peoples, one new man.<p>It is not only hard to have the real oneness between two peoples, but even between a man and a wife it is difficult. This is because the husband has his way, and the wife has her way. The male way and the female way are many times entirely different. On this earth among the human race there is much division. One group is divided from another group, neighbors are divided, and even husbands and wives are divided. Today&#8217;s trend is one of division. In the world the more different and individualistic a person is, the better. But this is altogether against God&#8217;s economy. God&#8217;s economy is to gather, to unite, and to make one.<p>The church is the Body of Christ. No one&#8217;s body can be divided or separated. The shoulders of a person&#8217;s body cannot divorce the arms. His body is not only gathered or united, but also made one. In like manner, the Body of Christ itself is oneness. The Bible tells us that God does not only want a Body for Christ, but He also wants a new man. The church, which is the Body of Christ, is a new man for God. It is impossible for a man to be divided. Many Christians do not realize that the Body of Christ, the new man, is God&#8217;s heart&#8217;s desire. This truth needs to be released to all the Lord&#8217;s children. Praise the Lord for Ephesians 2:15 which unveils Christ&#8217;s abolishing of the ordinances in order to create in Himself, of two peoples, one new man. This is glad tidings, and this is the truth from God&#8217;s Word.<h2 class=head1>THE FISHING MINISTRY, THE BUILDING MINISTRY,  AND THE MENDING MINISTRY</h2><p>According to the New Testament record, there were three prominent and leading apostles: Peter, Paul, and John. With all of these apostles, we can see the Lord&#8217;s heart&#8217;s desire to have the one new man. Peter played a prominent part in the initial record of the New Testament. In the Epistles, the Apostle Paul occupies a very prominent position. John&#8217;s writings are the conclusion and finalization of the New Testament. We can say that the New Testament began with Peter, was somewhat completed with Paul, and was fully touched by the Apostle John.<p>When Peter was called by the Lord, he and Andrew were &#8220;casting a net into the sea&#8221; (Matt. 4:18). They were made fishers of men (v. 19). Eventually, Peter became the first great fisher for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:37-42; 4:4). Peter&#8217;s ministry may be considered as a fishing ministry, the ministry that brings in the material. On the day of Pentecost, the Lord used Peter to bring in many Jewish believers, and he was also used by the Lord to bring in the first group of Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:44-46). According to the record of the New Testament, Peter caught the fish, gathered the materials, for the building up of the church. Paul was a tentmaker (Acts 18:3). His trade was a building trade, and his ministry was a building ministry. When John was called by the Lord, he and James were mending their nets in the boat (Matt. 4:21). Eventually, John became a real mender, mending the breakages in the church by his ministry of life. (See his three Epistles and Revelation 2 and 3.) Thus, in the New Testament we see the fishing ministry, the building ministry, and the mending ministry. With all three of these leading ministries, the light was shining strongly on the new man.<h2 class=head2>Peter and the One New Man</h2><p>God used Peter to bring in many Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost. Under the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty, many of them were from different cultures and spoke different languages (Acts 2:8-11). This implied something of God&#8217;s desire to gather together different peoples with different languages into one. After the day of Pentecost, Peter probably still held on to the concept that only the Jews as God&#8217;s chosen people could be saved for the church. In Acts 10 while Peter was keeping his hour of prayer, he received a vision concerning God&#8217;s plan and move. When Peter was praying, he was, no doubt, in the spirit. When he was in the spirit, he saw a vision. Acts tells us that &#8220;a trance came upon him&#8221; (10:10). A trance refers to a state in which a man passes out of himself and from which he comes to himself (12:11), as in a dream, but without sleep. In this trance, Peter saw a vessel like a great sheet descending onto the earth, in which were all manner of unclean animals.<p>The Word tells us that when Peter was praying &#8220;he became very hungry and desired to eat&#8221; (10:10). Then the trance came upon him and a voice said to him, &#8220;Rise up, Peter, slay and eat!&#8221; (v. 13). Peter&#8217;s response was, &#8220;By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean&#8221; (v. 14). His response indicated that he went back to his religious mentality. In the spirit while he was praying, a trance came upon him and he saw a wonderful vision. But when he heard the voice, he immediately returned to his Jewish, religious mentality.<p>When we read this story concerning Peter in Acts 10, we need to apply it to ourselves. In listening to a message or in our prayer we may see the vision of the new man. Then the Lord will come to us and tell us to rise, kill, and eat. For us to rise, kill, and eat means to take in what we do not like, digesting and assimilating it into our being. When we eat something, what we eat becomes us. There is a saying that says, &#8220;We are what we eat.&#8221; The four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds in the great sheet that Peter saw symbolized men of all kinds. To eat, in this sign, is to associate with people (10:28), to have fellowship with the Gentiles. For a Jew to associate with Gentiles was like eating unclean things. To eat something is to take that thing into us and make it one with us. Peter&#8217;s refusing to eat the unclean things contained in the great vessel that descended from the heavens is a portrait of the Jews&#8217; unwillingness to take in the Gentiles and to be one with them. Any Jew who would go to the Gentiles and become one with them would be like a person who eats unclean things.<p>We need to apply this vision to ourselves. The Japanese brothers need to take in the Chinese brothers and be one with them. The Chinese brothers also need to take in the Japanese brothers and be one with them. Both the Japanese brothers and the Chinese brothers need to rise, kill, and eat. Some of us may respond the way Peter did and tell the Lord that we would not eat anything unclean. In your prayer and in listening to a message you may say, &#8220;Hallelujah for the one new man!&#8221; But in your practice you may not want to take in something that is unclean to you.<p>Peter received an exceedingly clear vision from the heavens concerning fellowship with the Gentiles, and he took the lead to practice it in Acts 10. But in Galatians 2 Peter shrunk back from eating with the Gentile believers out of fear of those of the circumcision. In order to be faithful to the truth of the gospel, Paul rebuked Peter to his face (Gal. 2:11-14). We have to believe that, at least to some extent, Peter was renewed in the spirit of his mind. In Galatians 2 Paul tells us that Peter was eating with the Gentiles (v. 12). This was altogether against the Jewish ordinance. Although Peter was renewed, he was afraid of being criticized by those of the circumcision. As a result, he pretended that he would not eat with the Gentiles.<h2 class=head2>Paul and the One New Man</h2><p>Paul was much deeper and stronger in Judaism than Peter was. Peter was a fisherman from Galilee, but Paul was a scholar in the Jewish religion. He was taught at the feet of Gamaliel, the great Jewish teacher (Acts 22:3). In Galatians 1 Paul told us that he &#8220;advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race&#8221; (v. 14). Paul was greatly zealous for the Jewish religion with its traditions and ordinances. Despite Paul&#8217;s strong Jewish background, he was able to tell us in 1 Corinthians 12:13 that we were all baptized into one Body, &#8220;whether Jews or Greeks.&#8221; In Galatians 3:27-28 Paul told us that those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and &#8220;there cannot be Jew nor Greek.&#8221; In Colossians 3:10-11 Paul told us that the Jew and the Greek have no place in the new man. For you and me to say such a word might be easy. But for Paul to speak in such a way with his deep and strong Jewish education, shows the marvelous renewing in his mentality.<p>Even the Apostle Paul, however, made a great mistake due to the influence of Judaism. The leading ones in the church in Jerusalem with James taking the lead told Paul to observe &#8220;how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous for the law&#8221; (Acts 21:20). These Jews were believers in Christ, yet they all still kept the ordinances. The brothers in Jerusalem were concerned because these Jews had been instructed concerning Paul that he was &#8220;teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs&#8221; (v. 21). These Jews were typical believers in Christ, yet they still kept the ordinances, and they heard that Paul was breaking the ordinances. As a result of this, the brothers suggested that Paul participate in a Nazarite vow with four other men. They instructed Paul to do this so that all would know concerning Paul that &#8220;there is nothing to the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law&#8221; (v. 24). Paul was convinced by the brothers and entered into the temple to participate in the Nazarite vow.<p>Paul was surely clear that such a practice was of the out-of-date dispensation, which, according to the principle of his teaching in the New Testament ministry, especially in Romans and Galatians, should be repudiated in God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Yet Paul still went through with it. Paul went back to the temple, and the Lord would not allow it. When the seven days of the vow were about to be concluded, the Lord intervened in His sovereignty. He allowed Paul to be arrested by the Jews and imprisoned by the Romans. After that, in A.D. 70, the Lord sent the Roman army under Titus to completely destroy Jerusalem with the temple. This fulfilled the Lord&#8217;s prophecy in Matthew 24 when He said concerning the temple that &#8220;a stone shall by no means be left upon a stone which shall not be thrown down&#8221; (v. 2). Paul was clear when he came to Jerusalem, but the atmosphere and the environment there forced him to take the compromising proposal which would bring in a mixture that could devastate God&#8217;s New Testament economy concerning the church.<h2 class=head2>John and the One New Man</h2><p>In the Apostle John&#8217;s writings, we cannot see any kind of defect. No one can deny that both Peter and Paul had failures with respect to the new man. With the Apostle John, however, we cannot see these kinds of mistakes. In the book of Revelation John told us that the Lord purchased by His blood &#8220;men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation&#8221; (5:9). We should not forget that John was also Jewish, but this word indicates that his mind was greatly renewed. He confirmed that Christ died on the cross to redeem men from different tribes, tongues, peoples, and nations. Through John we also see that the churches are the golden lampstands (Rev. 1:11-12) and consummately these lampstands become the New Jerusalem. In the lampstands and in the New Jerusalem we can see no differences in peoples.<h2 class=head1>THE RENEWING OF THE MIND IN OUR DAILY LIFE FOR THE ONE NEW MAN</h2><p>About twenty centuries have passed since the Lord&#8217;s death on the cross, but we must ask ourselves where the builded church is. The Lord said that He would build His church (Matt. 16:18), and Paul told us that we are &#8220;being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit&#8221; (Eph. 2:22), but where is the building? We need to ask even furthermore where the new man is on the earth today. Many Christians do not even have any kind of concept concerning the new man.<p>I studied at an American Presbyterian school. The American missionaries there held their conferences absolutely separate from the native Chinese pastors. Even the Christians of this one group were divided because of racial differences. In the United States there are some denominational congregations who will not allow blacks to worship with them. Where is the new man? The new man was created on the cross but does not exist among the Christians today. As we have seen, for the existence of the new man to be realized, there is the need of three steps after Christ&#8217;s death on the cross: the baptism in the Spirit, the constant drinking of the one Spirit, and the renewing in the spirit of our mind. In order to have the Body life and in order to have the new man, we must be renewed in the spirit of our mind. We need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. Formerly, we may have thought that this kind of renewing was mostly for our personal behavior. But we have seen that this renewing is even more for the Body life and for the new man. If our mentality remains in the same condition, there is no possibility of having the one new man. If we remain in our natural mentality, we cannot even have the proper church life in our locality.<p>Every race has its own character, its own disposition. When I went to Scotland, I noticed that nearly every little village and home was very well kept. Their lawns, trees, and flowers were landscaped beautifully. The Chinese are much different from the Scottish people. Because I am Chinese, I have the ground to say something concerning them. Generally speaking, they will spend a lot of time in their cooking, but hardly any time to take care of their lawn, flowers, and trees. What if a typical Scottish brother and his family were to live next to a typical Chinese brother and his family? The Scottish character would become a problem to the Chinese, and the Chinese character would become a problem to the Scot. They may not criticize one another directly, but in their hearts there would be much criticism. The Chinese brother might even say to his wife that the Scottish brother does not love the church as much as he loves his front yard. He might ask concerning the Scottish brother, &#8220;Does he spend as much time in his Bible as he does to arrange his flowers? He is altogether worldly.&#8221; The Scottish brother may say to his wife, &#8220;That Chinese brother loves the Lord, but he is so sloppy and lazy. He rarely cuts his lawn.&#8221; The Scottish and Chinese families are in the church. In the morning they criticize one another, not openly but secretly. Then in the evening they come to the Lord&#8217;s table. You can see how the ordinances can be a great frustration to the proper church life. Both families need their minds renewed.<p>Humanly speaking, there is no possibility of getting rid of the differences between the races. In addition to our national character, each one of us has a particular character and disposition since we were raised in different environments and come from different backgrounds. Without the Lord&#8217;s grace and without the Spirit, no one could be one with anyone else. We may have the doctrine. We may have listened to a message concerning the one new man. We may have received and accepted the vision of the one new man. But what about our practical, daily living? Are we day by day really under the renewing in the spirit of our mind? The matter of renewing is very practical. If you are really renewed, this will be seen in your practical, daily life. When the Lord saved us, we began to love Him. Now we realize we have to practice the proper church life in putting on the one new man. This is why we need to ask the Lord to renew our mind and transform our inward being. In our prayer we must have a desire to get into the practicality of the new man. We need to ask the Lord to show us what the real practical problem is in our daily living for our fellowship with all the saints, for our church life. I believe that if we ask the Lord to shine on us in this way, He will point out many things.<p>The Scottish brother&#8217;s disposition cannot be justified nor can the Chinese brother&#8217;s disposition. Both brothers need to be transformed. They need to be renewed in the spirit of their mind. If a person is sloppy in his disposition, he should exercise his spirit to clean his front yard, perhaps once a week. On the other hand, we should not spend more time taking care of our lawn and our yard than we do on the Bible. Our mind has to be renewed, and we still have to be proper human beings. Everything about us, especially in our homes, should be in a good order. Our natural disposition must be renewed so that we can be transformed into the image of Christ.<p>Many of the brothers who are Chinese have graduated from college and can speak English. But when they talk to one another, they speak in Chinese. This may be according to their habit and not according to Christ. The renewing of our minds is to make us renewed persons, not habitual persons. When a Chinese brother speaks in Chinese around some American brothers, the American brothers may think that he wants to keep something confidential. As a result, the American brothers may be offended. This again shows how we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind for the church life as the one new man. On the other hand, the American brothers should not be offended by this. Instead, they should sympathize with the Chinese brothers. Our attitude toward one another needs to be renewed. The attitude, the spirit, and the atmosphere in the church life could be one of division instead of oneness. Even the language barrier can cause an attitude of division. I was in a situation where some American and Chinese brothers were having some fellowship. When the Chinese brothers began to speak in Chinese, the Americans got offended and the fellowship was terminated. This illustrates how language can bring the practical church life to an end.<p>Although you may have seen the new man, you need to take care of the renewing in your mind. If I still behave habitually in my national character, this will kill the church life. If we have seen the vision of the one new man, by His mercy we need to keep ourselves in the spirit. The new man has been created and all the ordinances are abolished. Now we need to practice to put on the one new man. If I behave habitually in my Chinese character, and the American brothers behave habitually in their American character, we cannot have the new man. We cannot have the church life. All we will have is a society where some Chinese and some Americans are gathered together. This is not the church but a social club.<p>I believe that the Lord&#8217;s grace will work in us and upon us to such an extent that we are not only renewed in our prayer, but also in our daily life we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind. When we pray ourselves into the spirit, we are being renewed. Peter was renewed in the trance that he had, but in practice Peter had a problem. Today it is the same with us. When we pray, we pray ourselves into the spirit, but we have to keep ourselves all the time in our spirit in our daily life. Do not let yourself come out of the spirit.<p>Through this fellowship, we can see how much renewal we need in all the matters of our daily life. The husbands need to be renewed in their relationships with their wives. Do not be what you have habitually been. You have to be renewed in the spirit of your mind actually and daily in your living. Otherwise, there is no way for the Lord to have the Body, and no way for Him to have the new man. This is not a matter of adjusting our behavior but a matter of being transformed by being renewed in the spirit of our mind to make us another person. Daily we need to put off the old man and put on the new man. For this we need to drink of the one Spirit that we may be renewed in the spirit of our mind in every area of our practical, daily life.</body></html>
