There are also artificial flowers and trees, some of which are so skillfully made that it is difficult to tell whether or not they are real
They replied that the only thing missing in a dead person is life; all the elements that were in him when he was alive remain intact
In the universe life truly exists, but even until today scientists are still not able to give an accurate definition of life
Even though our existence lies in life and our meaning also lies in life, no one understands life or the mystery of life
We are human beings because we have the human life, which enables us to do human things and have a human living
The mind is used for considering matters, the emotion is related to preferences, and the will is related to decisions
The other half of his time might be spent thinking about bad things, loving bad things, and choosing bad things
What kind of life enables a person to do good things as well as bad things and to have good thoughts as well as bad thoughts?
All human beings have life, but this life has problems, because sometimes it leans toward good things and at other times toward bad things
Previously we said that a decent person spends half his time on good things and the other half on bad things, but this is not truly accurate
It is more accurate to say that a person spends ninety percent of his time on bad things and ten percent on good things
We are bad more often than we are good because we can appear to be good on the surface but not be good inwardly
In itself love is good; however, in our love there are pride, selfishness, greed, and self-interest, all of which are not good
Your gentleness is good, but in your gentleness there is a 'worm' of pride that grows and surrounds your gentleness
If we use a knife to cut out the rotten portion, the deeper we cut into the fruit, the more we need to throw away
Fruit may look good, but after all the cutting is done, nothing good is left, and the entire fruit has to be discarded
Similarly, you may appear to be a good person, but if you investigate, you will find that your so-called good part is not really good
You may say that you are an honest person, but eventually you will discover that there are problems in your honesty
We should never think the reason we are not good is simply that we were influenced by others or because we picked up a bad habit
We must realize that the reason we can be influenced by others or pick up a bad habit is because of the nature of our life
If he is good at taking advantage of others, you might become more skillful than he is in taking advantage of others
If two young people have evil intentions, when they come together, they will incite each other to do bad things
Before a young man gets together with a classmate, he may not know too much, and he cannot do too many wicked things
Please remember this sign, this miracle, this evidence, this manifestation, so that you may know yourself and realize that you are corrupt
If you would receive His mercy and allow Him to enlighten you, in His light you will discover that you are entirely corrupt
You must know that there is nothing good in human life; the inner being of every human being is full of deceit
Because human life is exceedingly corrupt, weak, and temporary, it is impossible for us to live a good human life with eternal value
We must realize that human life is corrupt and weak, that we need a higher life, and that this higher life is in the Lord Jesus
At this point life had not yet been generated; there was only light shining into the darkness and separating the darkness from the light
On the second day God 'separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse
On the first day He separated light from darkness, and on the second day He separated the waters under the expanse from the waters above
On the third day 'God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so
God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good
God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them
Since the life of most plants is contained in the seed, the story of life begins with the bringing forth of grass, herbs, and trees
We must remember that it was not until the third day, after the three steps of separation, that life came forth
On the fifth day 'God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed
It is wonderful that according to the record of Genesis 1, God did not focus on the various items which He had created
On the first day light was brought in, and subsequently there were three steps of separation to generate the lowest forms of life
The living animals were created: 'cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind'
Cattle refers to cows and sheep, and animals of the earth refer to other creatures, such as lions, tigers, and elephants
These animals possess consciousness and feelings that are much higher than the consciousness and feelings of fish and birds
God gave all that He had created in the sea, on the land, and in the air to man for man to exercise authority over them
In the universe, in addition to these forms of life, which are all created, there is still another life, the uncreated life
According to its literal meaning, the prefix re means to do something again; hence, regeneration means 'to generate again'
If Adam had eaten the fruit from the tree of life, he would have received God's life into him; he would have been regenerated
He said, 'He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me' , and 'He who believes into the Son has eternal life'
If Adam had eaten the tree of life, it would have been equivalent to Adam receiving the Lord of life into himself to be his life
We should never think that only fallen men need to be born again, or that a person who is not fallen would not need to be born again
Regeneration means that in addition to our life we obtain another life Gods life which is a second life the eternal life the highest life
In other words, the life of the tree of life would have entered into man; the tree of life would have been planted into man
Someone may come to him and say, 'You should not be bothered when the sisters are praised, because brothers are different from sisters
A person with dirty clothes and messy hair can be given clean clothes and a comb, but this would improve only his outward appearance
The Lord told Nicodemus that teaching and improvement availed nothing; Nicodemus needed to obtain another life
We have something more than Adam had; in the beginning in the garden of Eden, Adam was sinless, but we are sinful
Whenever sin is mentioned, these three aspects are involved: one is outside of us, another is inside of us, and the third is before God
Satan, through his word and through the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, entered into Adam
From that time Adam was no longer pure, because within Adam there was not only the element of man but also the element of Satan, the devil
One day Satan, through his word and the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, injected his element and thoughts into Adam
The Chinese refer to gamblers as gambling demons, drunkards as drinking demons, and opium-smokers as opium demons
Those who drink, smoke, or gamble will invariably discover that there is an evil force compelling them to do these things
Regrettably, Adam was tempted by Satan to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was corrupted
It is therefore not as simple for us to obtain God's life as it was for the created man, Adam, in the beginning
On the one hand, we have a sinful nature within us, and on the other hand, we have many sinful deeds outside of us
God can give us His life only when these three aspects of sin-the sinful deeds, the sinful nature, and the record of sin-are solved
For fallen and corrupted people to obtain God as life, God also had to pass through death to accomplish redemption
He stood in the position of a sinner; hence, He was forsaken by God, judged by God, stricken by God, and put to death by God
He became the same as we, who have flesh; that is, He became the same as we are by putting on the body of flesh
Numbers 21:4-9 says that the people of Israel spoke against God in the wilderness and that fiery serpents came to bite them
He was the serpent lifted up on the pole, but He had only the form of the serpent without the serpent's poison
Before the Lord Jesus was crucified, He said, 'Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out,' and 'the ruler of this world has been judged'
Through incarnation the Word, who is God, became flesh, in the likeness of the flesh of sin, that is, the likeness of a fallen man
Although Christ was a fallen man only in likeness, when He was on the cross, God counted that likeness as real
When the Lord Jesus was on the cross not only did He stand in the position of a sinner and bear all our sins but He also bore us the sinners
He judged Satan in man, He condemned sin in the flesh, and He judged sin, which is Satan's nature, Satan himself
The Lord stood in the position of a sinner, bore the sins of man, and had the likeness of the flesh of sin when He died on the cross
He shed His blood to end sin, to terminate Satan, and to redeem man, thereby accomplishing redemption before God
Formerly, we were those who were bitten by the serpent and were under the pole on which the bronze serpent was set
The second half of verse 3 says, 'He cannot see the kingdom of God,' and verse 5 explains that 'seeing' is 'entering'
To see the kingdom of God is to enter into the kingdom of God, and to enter into the kingdom of God is to see the kingdom of God
You do not have to memorize the Scriptures chapter by chapter; however, you must memorize the important and precious verses
Christianity gives people the impression that they need salvation because they are sinful and destined to perish
Most of the books said that water denotes the Word and that to be born of water and the Spirit means to be born of the Word and the Spirit
When John came preaching the word of repentance, he was saying that all had sinned against God and were corrupt, even incorrigibly corrupt
John told the people who came to listen to his preaching that they were sinful, utterly wicked, and that they were worthy only of death
John told people that his baptizing them in water could only put them into death, bury them, and terminate them
John could not cause people to have life; he was sent by the Lord merely to put people into death, to bury them and terminate them
In order to be born of water and the Spirit a person needs to confess before God that he opposes and rebels against God
When a person believes in the Lord and confesses his sins, the Holy Spirit enters into him to enliven his human spirit
We must realize that there is not only the ministry of John the Baptist but also the ministry of the Lord Jesus
John's ministry is a ministry of condemnation and death, but the ministry of the Lord Jesus is an enlivening ministry
If man wants to understand the things in God's realm and be able to submit to the authority in God's kingdom, man must have God's life
Through regeneration we have Gods life are in Gods world know the things in Gods world and can submit to the authority of Gods kingdom
In John 3:6 the Lord said, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
Since he was born of the flesh, he had only the natural life; that is, he had man's original life, which is now a corrupt life
If you close your eyes and use your ears, which are for hearing, you will not be able to tell whether a color is white or green
All our physical organs need to be brought to a stop so that we can use our inner organ, our spirit, to contact God
The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes'
Sometimes when we are walking on the street, the wind blows so strongly that it becomes difficult for us to walk
Although we cannot see or touch the Spirit, He is blowing in us, and sometimes He causes us to be beside ourselves
A violent wind came and blew upon Peter and John, making them look like they were drunk with wine; they were crazy and fearless
When some Christians experience an adverse situation or encounter difficulty, other people cannot tell that they are in any kind of turmoil
We have also seen some Christians who love the Lord, are living, and are often joyful but who are unable to handle any difficulty
Even though a person who allows the Lord to make home in his heart is full of feeling, he is calm in any circumstance he encounters
When Peter was brought before the magistrate, he did not panic when he spoke, and when he was locked up in prison, he was also secure
Not only did Peter have the Lord within him and not only did he have the Lords appearing but even more the Lord was making His home in Peter
Since the church is the dwelling place of God, the building up of the church will be frustrated if Christ cannot make home in the saints
They also allow Christ to be their life until Christ occupies every corner of their heart, and they become His dwelling place
If we are at rest and cannot be disturbed, having a calmness that cannot be shaken, the Lord is making His home in us
If we still reserve legal rights to ourselves, that is, if we do not have the throne of God in us, He has not yet made home in our heart
If we read the Scriptures concerning the New Jerusalem carefully, we will see that the New Jerusalem is entirely a manifestation of life
Such a rich manifestation of life is the issue of the river of water of life, which flows continuously without any obstruction
The light in the city is not the light from the sun or from the moon, but God Himself is the light-God's glory shines as the light
Not only will we feel bright, but when other people contact us, they will immediately sense that we are transparent and bright persons
His whole being is like a wall made of iron or steel, which no light can penetrate and out of which no light can shine
Whenever and wherever we run into him, we will feel that he is as fresh as the morning and is full of vigor like the dawning of the sun
Not only does such a saint make us feel fresh living secure at peace and bright but when we touch him we sense that we are touching light
Our whole being will be occupied and filled with God so that we become His dwelling place and so that He makes His home in us
We must learn to live by Him and cooperate with Him, letting Him appear to us regularly so that He may make His home in us
If after we are saved we love the Lord follow Him and keep His commandments the Lord will manifest Himself to us and make an abode with us
Most people who read John 14 think that this is a reference to the Lord's bringing us to heaven because He is in heaven
Verse 16 says, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
For this reason, some theologians have attempted repeatedly to use analogies to explain this three-one reality
The theologians who use this analogy say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are just like ice, water, and vapor
According to the revelation of the Bible the Father continued to exist when He was incarnated in the Son that is when the Word became flesh
One day the disciples asked the Lord to show them the Father, and the Lord answered, 'He who has seen Me has seen the Father'
The substance of God's salvation is the Triune God being mingled with man and man being mingled with the Triune God
If we tell a child that there is water in the air or that there is vapor in the air, he may not understand or believe us
He felt that there must be something special about Christians; otherwise, how could this woman sing and rejoice instead of fearing death
He said, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
We know that the Lord is in us, and that we are in the Lord, but we need to ask whether we have the Lord's manifestation
Our being in the Lord is different from the Lord's manifesting Himself to us, which is also different from His making an abode with us
We praise God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and we give thanks to God in the name of the Lord Jesus
Whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him'
Ephesians says that we should be filled with the Holy Spirit, whereas Colossians says that we should be filled with the Lord's word
In other words, the result mentioned in both portions is the same-praising and giving thanks; however, the cause is different
In Ephesians the cause is our being filled with the Holy Spirit, and the result is that we praise and thank the Lord
In Colossians the cause is our being filled with the Lord's word, and the result is that we praise and thank the Lord
John 15:7 says, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you'
We need to abide in the Lord and let His words abide in us, then we can ask whatever we will, and it shall be done for us
Not only so, since He is one with God and is mingled with God, He will cause us also to be one with God and mingled with God
According to 14:21 and 23 two conditions must be met: one is that we love Him, and the other is that we keep His word
These verses show that in order to have the Lords manifestation and His making an abode with us we need to properly deal with the Lords word
Whether we can have the Lord's manifestation and His making an abode with us depends on how we deal with the word
According to the Bible, there are several matters that should not be neglected when dealing with the Lord's word
If we neglect these matters, we will not properly deal with the word, and there will be a problem between the word and us
We compared these two portions and saw that while these two portions show the same result, they have different causes
They can be likened to twin sisters who have similar facial features but who, if you look at them closely, are actually different
Being filled with the word and being filled with the Spirit are not two different types of filling but two aspects of one filling
John 1:1 says that the Word was God, 4:24 says that God is Spirit, and 6:63 says that the Lord's words are spirit
If we would have a proper attitude toward the Lord and His word, we must see that the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God
When we have the words of the Bible in us, we will have the Holy Spirit, because these two are one-they are God
We may also say that the word of the Scripture is the Spirit, because God is Spirit and what He breathes out is also Spirit
We know that the liquid that we pour out of this glass must be grape juice because it came from a glass that contains grape juice
If we would understand the relationship between God, His word, and the Holy Spirit, we need a proper attitude toward the words in the Bible
In order to have a proper attitude toward the Lord's word, we must have a proper relationship with the Holy Spirit
If we are not filled with the Holy Spirit within, it will be difficult for us to have a proper attitude toward the word
If the Holy Spirit does not have the ground within us, it will not be easy for the word to have the ground within us
When a person breathes, he is neither in water nor in fire; rather, he is in the air, and consequently he inhales air
On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down, and the one hundred twenty disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit
They prayed and prayed until they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit-the outward filling of the Holy Spirit
In order to deal with the Holy Spirit properly and be filled with the Holy Spirit, we must be a person of prayer
Since the Holy Spirit and the word are one, when the Holy Spirit enters into us and fills us, He brings the word into us
Whenever we pray, the Spirit will operate and move within us, and the Spirit's moving and operating is the Lord's speaking
Once we receive the Lords word into us we immediately have the Lords presence His manifestation and the Lord will make His abode with us
The more we have the word, the more we will have His presence in us, and the more we have His presence, the easier it will be to pray
If we want the word in the Scriptures to enter into us, we must be persons of prayer; we must pray in the Holy Spirit
Without the realization that the word and the Holy Spirit are one, our attitude toward the word will not be proper
Similarly, if we are not persons who regularly pray in the Holy Spirit, even if the word comes into us, there will be no ground in us for it
The more we pray, the more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, and the more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more we have the word
We must pay attention to one thing: we must exercise to live in the Lord and to have His genuine manifestation, that is, His presence
To this end we must be persons of prayer who learn to pray diligently, and we must also be persons who read the Word and study it
Suppose you have an argument with your sister at home; she says that you are wrong, and you say that she is wrong
As you continue to say that she is wrong and that you are right, in the deepest part of your being there is a sense that you are wrong
If we do not read the Bible in this way, the Bible will be like any other book, which can be understood by reading and reciting
These are done outside of the Holy Spirit and cannot help us touch God nor help us 'eat' the Lord and 'drink' the Lord
If we would touch the Lord, eat the Lord, and drink the Lord, we must pray in the Spirit and read the Bible in the Spirit
The Lord in us, the Holy Spirit in us, and the word in us will enable us to pray in the Lord's feeling and according to His desire
If we are willing to learn, this message can give us a way that will enable us to touch the source of unlimited blessing
Such a living far surpasses listening to messages, attending meetings, or participating in various kinds of Christian activities
We must all see that to pray in the spirit and to read the Lord's Word in the spirit are precious, practical, and intimate
There are two aspects of the significance of breaking the bread, and both aspects are related to life and building
The first aspect of the significance of the bread-breaking meeting is that the Lord wants us to receive Him as the bread of life
When the Lord established His supper, He said, 'This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me'
When we receive the bread with our hand, we should also use our spirit to contact the Lord Jesus as the bread of life
When we take the bread into us, we should also use our spirit to receive the Lord Jesus as the bread of life into us
We can use our spirit to receive, absorb, and enjoy the Lord, and we can have sweet fellowship with Him in our spirit
The second aspect of the significance of breaking bread does not concern what the Lord is to us or what we are to the Lord
The bread that we take during the bread-breaking meeting is produced from many grains that have been ground into powder and blended together
In John 1224 the Lord said Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
The second significance concerns the joining of every believer to be the one mystical Body of Christ, the church
The Lord Jesus gave up His own body on the cross so that He could impart Himself into us to produce His mystical Body
His physical body is His alone by birth; His mystical Body is composed of the believers, thousands of saved ones
Through death He gave up His physical body on the cross; through life in resurrection He gained a mystical Body
On the one hand this bread speaks of the physical body that was given up for us that is the Lord Jesus gave up His body on the cross for us
Ephesians 41112 shows that the apostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers are gifts for the building up the Body of Christ
We should also sense that after we eat and drink the Lord, we are being built up together with the saints to become one bread, one Body
Even if we focus on remembering the Lord and enjoying the Lord, this is only the first half of the significance of breaking the bread
Often, we pay attention only to the relationship between us and the Lord but neglect the relationship between us and all the saints
The second aspect of the significance of breaking the bread speaks of the relationship between us and all the believers
Paul's intention was to remind the Corinthians not to forget that the bread they touched signifies the mystical Body of Christ
In the eyes of the Lord, what you are doing cannot be considered as breaking the bread or eating the Lord's supper
In many places, when the children of God come together to break the bread, they stress only the first aspect of remembering the Lord
They stress the relationship between them and the Lord, but neglect the second aspect, which is the relationship among all the saints
Although the saints harbor a grudge against each other, when they come to the Lord's table, they conduct themselves as if nothing is amiss
The younger ones despise the older ones and the older ones are dissatisfied with the younger ones both privately spread many words of death
On the Lords Day they sit at the Lords table with those whom they have criticized and are unwilling to forgive and they take the same bread
We must exercise until we are at peace and in harmony with the other saints, and there is no separation or problem among us
Only then will we not merely remember the Lord when we break bread; rather, we will also have fellowship with all the saints in His Body
The bread also signifies the Lord's mystical Body, the church, which He obtained through regenerating us with His resurrection life
Not only so, every time we take the bread, we remember that the bread is made of many grains that were blended together
When we take the bread, we have fellowship with all those who belong to the Lord, and we declare that we enjoy all the saints
On the first day of every week, we come to the Lord's table to declare the way that we will live for the upcoming week
At the same time, we also declare that as those who have the Lord's life and live by this life, we have become one Body
The life we have within is the Lord, and the church life that we live out is the mutual coordination of all the members
At the beginning of every week, which is the start of a new course of our journey, we come together to make a declaration
We see this in the next verse which says Seeing that there is one bread we who are many are one Body for we all partake of the one bread
Please remember that the proper way to break the bread is to enjoy the Lord and at the same time to enjoy the saints
In a physical body each member enjoys the supply from the head and at the same time enjoys the supply from all the other members
No member can have an exclusive relationship with the head, and no member can receive and enjoy an exclusive supply from the head by itself
If any member becomes isolated, it loses the supply not only from all the other members but also from the head
In order to maintain a relationship with the head, a member must maintain a relationship with all the other members
When we break bread, we remember and enjoy the Lord, and we also fellowship with all the saints and enjoy them
The saints can be a greater supply to us because ninety percent of the supply that the Lord gives us is through the saints
Some may say that they always receive their supply from the Lord and do not feel that they receive much supply from the brothers and sisters
When we go to a brother, it seems as if he does not have much with which to supply us, and he has many problems
Concerning the co-workers, elders, and deacons, some saints say, 'The co-workers in our locality are in a poor condition
Some saints have replied, 'There is no doubt that the saints are saved and that they all have the Lord's life in them
If this is the case, we must see that all the co-workers, whether they are brothers or sisters, are earthen vessels
The elders are earthen vessels, the deacons are earthen vessels, every brother is an earthen vessel, and every sister is an earthen vessel
The co-workers, elders, deacons, and the brothers and sisters have this treasure in them, but they are still earthen vessels
The co-workers, elders, deacons, and the brothers and sisters all have weaknesses because they are earthen vessels
If we look at the saints from this point of view, we will immediately see that they have a portion of Christ for us to enjoy
There may be a brother who is confused and weak, who does not have our insight, ability, intelligence, or boldness
As soon as we speak with him concerning the preciousness of Christ, we sense that the fragrance of Christ is coming forth from within him
We all must see that every believer is an earthen vessel with weaknesses, but he also contains Christ, the treasure
When He was living in the flesh, He did not have any weaknesses or wrongdoings, but the flesh He put on was a lowly and weak body
They knew Him according to the flesh and said Is not this the carpenter the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon
In John 8:15-19 and 28 through 29 the Lord Jesus seemed to say, 'You know people according to their appearance, their flesh
The apostle Paul says, 'Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer'
From that day onward, Paul knew the Lord not outwardly according to the flesh but inwardly according to the spirit
After he wrote his first Epistle to the Corinthians, some of the believers in Corinth said that Paul's letters were 'weighty and strong'
If we compare ourselves with others, we are comparing one earthen vessel with another, and we will think that our earthen vessel is better
When we consider others, we should not consider their strong or weak points, we should consider only the portion of Christ in them
Another brother's relationship with the Lord has brought him to a point of being broken by God, but we do not have this portion
In other words, the pointing of a finger, the finding of fault, the speaking of wickedness, and the spreading of death are done in darkness
When we consider others more excellent than ourselves by treasuring the portion of Christ in them, our inner being becomes bright
If we want to look at shortcomings, we should first look at our own shortcomings before we look at others' shortcomings
The Lord's presence will make up for whatever shortcomings we have, and His presence will rescue us from our mistakes
Whenever we take the bread, we should deal with any barrier between us and the Lord and any barrier between us and the saints
In these verses the Lord said that after He resurrected from the dead, He would regenerate us by entering into us to be our life
Judas, not Iscariot, said to Him, Lord, and what has happened that You are to manifest Yourself to us and not to the world?
God also assured Moses that He would bear the responsibility and that His presence, His face, would go with Moses
While Moses led the children of Israel on their journey to the land of Canaan, Moses did not lose God's presence, God's face
God did not only accompany Moses by walking with him; God also manifested Himself to Moses throughout the journey
In the New Testament age the Lord's salvation is to save us into Himself so that we are joined to Him in life and in essence
It is true that the Lord's salvation solves the problem of our sins and that there is forgiveness of our sins and deliverance from perdition
We often address believers as 'brothers and sisters in the Lord,' or when referring to a believer, we say, 'He is a person in the Lord'
When electricity is transmitted into the microphone, the microphone is in the current of electricity; it is in electricity
Similarly, those who believe in the Lord Jesus are in Him because the Lord is the Spirit, and His Spirit has come into us
After a person is saved, if his living is normal and overcoming, he should constantly have the Lord's manifestation, the Lord's face
In our inner being we were very clear that the Lord was manifesting Himself to us and that His presence was with us
There have been many times when we knew that the Lord was not manifesting Himself to us; instead, He was hidden from us
Fundamentally, being a Christian is not a matter of dealing with the world or sins, nor is it a matter of doing good or evil
Even if we do not sin, if the Lord hides His face from us, it will be difficult for us to have a good Christian life
If you contact the Lord in this way, the Lord will say, 'I will go with you,' and you will always have His manifestation, His face
Any dispute between us and the Lord in which we defeat the Lord instead of letting Him defeat us, proves that we do not love Him enough
It may not have been concerning movies, but we have many such arguments with the Lord, and it seems that we always defeat the Lord
The Lord gives us a commandment, but we receive it grudgingly, or we say that we would rather do something else
Because the child did not want to let go of the Lord, he wished that the Lord had not given him this commandment
He hoped in his heart that the Lord would change this commandment, but the Lord insisted on his giving the ten dollars away
When the Lord gives them a command that does not correspond to their preferences, they argue with the Lord and defeat Him
The most precious thing for a believer is to experience not only the Lord's manifestation but also His making an abode with him
When He is able to obtain a dwelling place in us and have rest, we are able to obtain a dwelling place in Him and have rest as well
These two matters, the Lord's manifestation and His making an abode, depend on our loving the Lord and obeying His commandments
These verses clearly show how we can experience the Lord's manifestation and His coming to make an abode with us
Both the Father and the Lord Jesus love a person who keeps the Lord's commandments, and They manifest Themselves to him
You do not have to deal with anything except whether or not the Lord manifests Himself to you and whether or not He makes an abode with you
The Lord's manifestation is something you sense within, and His making an abode with you is also something you can sense within
The only reason that you would not have joy or be secure or at peace is that there is a dispute between you and the Lord
If we love the Lord, do not argue with Him, and listen to His words and obey them, He will appear to us moment by moment
Hebrews 10:38-39 says, ''My righteous one shall live by faith; and if he shrinks back, My soul does not delight in him'
Chapter 11 speaks of what faith is and the history of faith, showing that many people in the Old Testament lived and walked by faith
In the Chinese Union Version the phrase looking away unto is translated as 'looking to'; however, looking to is inadequate
By looking away unto the Lord Jesus with undivided attention, we are separated from everything in our present and in our past
For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls'
Both 'fainting in your souls' and 'who have faith to the gaining of the soul' in 10:39 are related to the soul
The Epistle to the Hebrews is probably the only book in the New Testament that speaks of how we follow the Lord on His pathway
They do not speak concerning the source of our motivation in following the Lord or of our pathway before the Lord
In the book of Hebrews all those who have been called by God to follow the Lord are to take the way of river crossing
According to Hebrews the motivating power for Christians to take the way of faith lies in the Lord Jesus Christ
The way that we take is the way of faith, and the motivating power for us to take this way is our knowledge of the Son of God
Our mind and our emotion should be occupied with Him, and what we gaze at, observe, and look away to should be the Lord
In the initial stages of the work, we were excited and had results; however, we were not on the pathway of faith
The Lord brought the Hebrew believers into trials by which all that they had regarded as precious gradually disappeared
Paul gave the history of the witnesses of faith, beginning with the first witness of faith in the Old Testament-Abel
The apostle listed the witnesses in order to show that those in the Old Testament who followed God took the way of faith
When he finished his journey and departed from this world, he had not gained an inheritance nor had he seen anything
We have consecrated ourselves, given up the world, followed the Lord, forsaken certain things for His sake, and worked for Him
Those who are redeemed by the Lord's precious blood and are regenerated have received the salvation of their spirit and are saved eternally
In the eyes of the Lord, if they do not walk the way of the Lord, or if they shrink back, they are not saved in their souls
Some of us may feel that our life is depressing and boring, and we may also feel that we are burdened and in a difficult situation
Although other people may not have problems and may do things without difficulty, nothing seems to be easy for us
It is not that the Lord does not provide for us, but He provides for us according to His assessment of our need
If instead of learning the lesson of faith, we yearn for the past experiences, some of us will either fall or shrink back
Verse 3 says Compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself so that you may not grow weary fainting in your souls
The book of Job was written on the human level, but it also reveals God's intention for man in his adversities
At the end of the book of Job God comes in and says that all the words spoken by Job and his three friends were words without knowledge
Job responded to these words and said, 'Today also my complaint is bitter; / My stroke is heavy because of my groaning
They do not realize that at the end of the book of Job God judged the words spoken by Job and his three friends
Rather, we should consider only whether God can supply us with grace, mercy, and blessing, not whether we are strong, perfect, or capable
When we read the Bible, it is not easy for us to differentiate which words are wrapping paper and which words are snacks
On the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness
He prayed three times, asking the Lord to remove the thorn, but the Lord said, 'My grace is sufficient for you'
Even though he fell into trouble, the father received him and then gave everything he had for the prodigal son to enjoy as grace
Even though Peter experienced many failures, he stood up and enjoyed God on the day of Pentecost because of His mercy
Grace can reach only the people who have a proper standing before God, not the people who have an improper standing
If this brother makes a mistake or even offends me, any gift to him would be related to mercy because his status has changed
God's intention was to give him grace, but God could not bestow grace on him because of his piety, strength, and accomplishments
The result of David's dealing with this sin was that he obtained the site for the building of the temple-the threshing floor of Araunah
God had no alternative but to allow the inability of David's piousness and strength to accomplish His intention to be exposed
David's fall was the result of his own actions; however, God was willing to let him fail in order that he would know God's grace
In his fall, David lost confidence in everything other than God, including confidence in his piousness and strength
One day our ability to give messages, our wisdom in administrating the church, our methods in the work, and everything else will be broken
He said that he had clean hands and a pure heart before God that he walked in his integrity that he trusted God and that he would not waver
Verse 19 says, 'Then You will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, / In burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings'
If we are strong in our will, the Lord will break it, and if we are particularly good in being patient, the Lord will break it too
If we are capable in administrating the church or in giving messages, sooner or later they will be broken by the Lord
Even though we are still the ones living and serving, our eloquence will be God, our morality will be God, and our strength will also be God
As soon as the morning broke, however, they listened to the Lord's word, cast their net, and hauled in a hundred and fifty-three fish
If God does not bless, all human labor on earth is in vain; after a whole night of labor not one fish will be gained
We should never think that we are able to do anything, that we have methods, are perfect, or have a good character
If we are too strong and prevent the grace of God from being manifested through us, at the necessary time God will allow us to be broken
Our effort can bring in only temporary prosperity that does not last; rather, it will either pass away or be broken by God
We enjoy the Lord's blessing, but we hope that the blessing we enjoy will extend to other places, not only to other places in Taiwan
If the angle from which we view a physical object is important, how much more important is it with regard to spiritual things?
It is difficult to know which influence is wrong and should be rejected and which influence is right and should be received
We need to spend time to ask the Lord to cause the visiting saints, whether they are local, from Taiwan, or from the West, to receive mercy
A person who has been touched by the Holy Spirit and has a desire to pursue the Lord will be 'hot' inside and outside
We must realize that the saints who are visiting from out of town and those who are participating in the training have tender feelings
Whatever situation they are in will form an indelible impression that will affect them for the rest of their lives
They thought that they knew God, understood God's logic, and knew God's acts, ways, and principles in dealing with man
The authority of darkness will try its best to damage and to spread negative, dead, and inaccurate information
For this reason, many do not have a sense of freshness concerning spiritual matters, including their service and spiritual pursuit
They know that in their Christian life they should not commit sins, especially gross sins, and this is sufficient for them
There are also believers who think that it is not necessary to live by faith or that it is wrong to experience poverty when serving the Lord
We cannot claim any credit for our standing before the Lord, because it is only by His mercy that we are still here
After the trials we will know that our relationship with the saints also depends on the Lord's mercy, not on our leading or our labor
We may be able to encourage others to take this way through such contact, but this will not cause them to continue on this way
In the past we have not been able to help those who had problems taking this way, in spite of our attempts to help them understand
It is not enough for others to lead us on this way, nor is it enough for others to contact us, because we will still be tested
After we are tested, we will know when others have begun to take this way, how far they have gone, and whether they have been tried
They knew that God cared for them and would deliver them from the land of Egypt, but they did not know why God would deliver them
After God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea and journeyed to the foot of Mount Sinai
God seemed to be saying that He delivered the children of Israel so that He might obtain a dwelling place, a house, in their midst
Before we were saved, we felt that we were desolate and suffering in the world because our life was vain and without hope
On the first day of the first month in the second year, the tabernacle was erected, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle
He intends to build us up to be His dwelling place, His house, so that He can fill this house for His expression
We know that those experiences cannot equal the presence of God that we experience in the meetings of the church
After two or three days, we gather again for another meeting, and again we see something glorious and touch something real
Even if there are no meetings, we can still sense that the saints have been built up to be the glorious house of God
The boards were able to stand firm because each board had two tenons and under each tenon was a socket which was made of a talent of silver
If you stand by yourself, you will turn toward the east today, toward the south tomorrow, and toward the west the next day
Gold overlaying wood signifies the mingling of the human nature and the divine nature so that the human nature can express the divine nature
In order to experience the uniting rings in our human nature, we need the divine life and nature to be manifested in us
The bars were arranged such that two bars formed a line at the top, two bars formed a line below, and one bar passed through the middle
Five is four plus one, signifying the created man plus the Creator being able to bear spiritual responsibility
The hangings of fine twined linen in the outer court were held and joined by hooks and connecting rods, both of which were made of silver
In other words Christs redemption as our foundation brings us into Gods nature and mingles us with God so that we can be overlaid with gold
On the one hand, we stand on Christ's redemption as our foundation, and on the other hand, we are mingled with the divine nature
The more we live in the divine life and nature, the more we will have the atmosphere and element of gold filling our midst
