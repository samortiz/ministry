   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Revelation 14:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And I heard a voice out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harp-singers playing on their harps."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This "voice out of heaven" is the voice of the hundred and forty-four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is as melodious as "the sound of harp-singers," as majestic as "the sound of loud thunder," and as tumultuous as "the sound of many waters."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>C. Revelation 14:3</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been purchased from the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only these can sing the new song.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All Christians are purchased, but these are the first to be purchased back to home.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All Christians are redeemed, but these are the first to be redeemed back to home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. Revelation 14:4</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse says, "These are they" two times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This explains who these hundred and forty-four thousand are:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1 "These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot say that the women here are idols, because the Bible never says this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nor can we say that the women here are evil doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible often translates "women" into "wives."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, "wives" in Acts 21:5 KJV is the same word in Greek as "women" in Revelation 14:4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible not only says that these are they who have not been defiled with women, but also that they are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we see that this passage is not only about chastity, but even more, it is about virginity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This corresponds with Matthew 19:10-12.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consider Revelation 14:1 again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has only given this gift to one hundred and forty-four thousand people cf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luke 20:35; 1 Cor 7:7 ; not every Christian has this gift.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the future when Antichrist appears, one of the dangers will be the forbidding of marriage 1 Tim 4:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Daniel said that the coming Antichrist will not marry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"And he will not regard the gods of his fathers or the desire of women" 11:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is impossible that only one hundred and forty-four thousand will not worship Antichrist; otherwise, who are they that overcome by not following the evil teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, 14:4 is an explanation and must, therefore, be explicit, requiring no further interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, the words of explanation are all in the present tense.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2 "These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse does not refer to things in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It refers to the present and to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are they who are closest to the Lord; they are like the Lord's bodyguards.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>3 "These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are men, but they are different from ordinary men, for they have been purchased from among men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Leviticus there are three different matters: the firstfruits 23:17 , the harvest, and the gleanings 23:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The harvest comes when there is the maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the reaping, the harvest does not remain in the field but is collected into the barn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The rapture is not determined by God but by man; when the harvest is ripe, it is reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The firstfruits are the Christians who mature first; they are raptured first.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>E. Revelation 14:5</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"And in their mouth no lie was found; they are without blemish."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The words of their mouths expose what is in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These two expressions were originally used to describe the Lord; now they are used to describe the hundred and forty-four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This does not mean that there are no females within the hundred and forty-four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Bible only records the males.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although there were females among those who left Egypt and among those who ate manna in the wilderness, God did not consider the female as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Adam is a man, a human being, while Eve is just a female.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, although Dinah was the daughter of Jacob Gen 30:21 , Israel still had only twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This does not mean that the people in Revelation 14:1-5 are the only ones in the first group of raptured ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It merely means that among the first group of raptured ones, there are those who are like this.</S>
