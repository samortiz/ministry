<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>CRUSHING SATAN UNDER OUR FEET TO BRING IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 16:20; 5:17b; 14:17</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The enjoyment of God’s salvation in life causing God to soon crush Satan under our feet—Rom. 16:20:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>That we may enjoy the God of peace, that is, enjoy the peace of God.</li>	<li>That we may also enjoy the grace of Christ.</li>	</ol></li><li>Bringing in God’s kingdom:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Reigning in Christ’s resurrection life—Rom. 5:17b.</li>	<li>Expanding God’s kingdom in His life—Rom. 14:17.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>We must reign in life, and we must live the church life in a locality. In this way, Satan will be bound and will be crushed under our feet. The Lord said in Matthew 16 that the gates of Hades shall not overcome the built-up church (v. 18). Following this, “the kingdom of the heavens’’ (v. 19) is mentioned. The interchangeable use of “the kingdom of the heavens’’ in this verse with “the church’’ in the previous verse proves strongly that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age. Hence, the church, the kingdom of God, and the dealing with Satan are all linked together. Where the church is, Satan is overcome, and the kingdom of God is brought in.<h2 class=head1>THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD’S SALVATION IN LIFE CAUSING GOD TO SOON CRUSH SATAN UNDER OUR FEET</h2><p>To enjoy the God of peace is to enjoy the peace of God (Rom. 16:20). It enables us to also enjoy the grace of Christ. In the New Testament Epistles, grace and peace are always mentioned together as being with us. We must live in the church life so that Satan can be crushed under our feet and so that we can fully enjoy the Lord’s grace and God’s peace.<h2 class=head1>BRINGING IN GOD’S KINGDOM</h2><h2 class=head2>Reigning in the Resurrection Life of Christ</h2><p>If we live the church life in a locality, we will bring in the kingdom. The reality of this kingdom is our reigning in the resurrection life of Christ. This is not something we do by ourself, our natural being, or our own effort. This reigning and ruling is in the resurrection life of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Expanding God’s Kingdom in His Life</h2><p>By reigning and ruling, the sphere of God’s rule will be expanded, His glory will be expressed, and His eternal purpose will be fulfilled. This is the way the kingdom of God is brought in.
