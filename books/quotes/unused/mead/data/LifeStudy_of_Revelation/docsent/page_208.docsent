   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE THE MATERIAL BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the material Babylon 18:1-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals three aspects of Babylon: the literal, ancient Babylon, the religious Babylon, and the material Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The site of ancient Babylon is in today s Iraq.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I visited that region eighteen years ago and found it to be dusty and hot, like an oven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I could not stand to stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before I visited that place, I had studied the curses pronounced upon Babylon recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Old Testament, especially the book of Jeremiah, contains many curses and condemnations pronounced by God upon Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In my visit I saw that in every respect the word of the Bible concerning Babylon had been proved true.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ancient city of Babylon is also the ancient Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis 11 speaks of the tower and city of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both Babel, the Hebrew word, and Babylon, the Greek word, mean confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Babel was founded by Cush, the father of Nimrod.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to history, Nimrod invented the pagan, idolatrous system of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many centuries later, Babel was enlarged by Nebuchadnezzar and became the Babylon known in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Babylon became an evil and devilish place because under Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonians destroyed God s temple and seized the holy vessels, the vessels for the service of God in the temple Dan 1:1-2; 2 Kings 25:8-9, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, Nebuchadnezzar brought these vessels to Babylon and placed them in the temple of his idols Dan 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was an insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the time of the recovery in the Old Testament, Ezra brought these vessels back to Jerusalem and placed them in the rebuilt temple Ezra 1:7-11; 5:14; 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, Babylon became evil not only because of her idolatry, but also because she destroyed God s temple and carried away into captivity God s people and the holy vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Bible we have two important lines the line of Babel and the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The line of Babel is a counterfeit of the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before God began the line of Jerusalem, Satan began his counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, two cities, Babylon and Jerusalem, are opposed to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two lines continue to the present day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is today s Jerusalem, and the Roman Catholic Church is today s Babel, Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, the daughters of the great prostitute, the denominations and groups which still practice some of the Babylonian traditions, also belong in the category of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only the pure, genuine local churches are in the line of Jerusalem today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapters seventeen through twenty-two are the ultimate conclusion of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In these chapters we also see two cities Babylon and Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Babylon will be utterly destroyed, and Jerusalem will be completely built up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the consummation of the Bible, the ultimate issue of the line of Babel and the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The writings of G. H. Pember and Alexander Hislop s The Two Babylons say that, without exception, every pagan religion originated with Babylonianism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The religion invented by Nimrod has spread throughout the world, even to India, China, and Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nimrod, for example, originated the picture of the Madonna and her child.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The story behind this picture is an evil story of incest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, that picture has been taken into Catholicism and presented as a picture of Mary and Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a child, I saw this picture of the woman and her infant in the idol temples in China.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later I was surprised to see the same picture in a Catholic cathedral.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, through study I learned that they were both of the same origin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first Catholic missionaries to go to China found the image of the Madonna and child already in the Buddhist temples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was also found in Japan and India.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the same picture under different titles is found everywhere, its origin can be traced to Nimrod at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This example illustrates that every religion is an outgrowth of Babylonianism.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All religion comes from one devilish source the ancient city of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The second aspect of Babylon is religious Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the eyes of God the Roman Catholic Church, which perpetuates much of Judaism and has assimilated much from paganism, is Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The third aspect of Babylon is the material Babylon, the city of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At times it is difficult to distinguish these three aspects of Babylon because the Bible blends them together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, the Babylon in Revelation 18 is material Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But when I was young, I was told by some Christian teachers that it is the literal Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This chapter, however, does not refer to the literal Babylon; it refers to the city of Rome, which is Babylon in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Revelation 17 and 18 two aspects of Babylon, the religious aspect and the material aspect, are mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, the female in chapter seventeen is a prostitute signifying the apostate church; on the other hand, she is a woman signifying the city of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 1 speaks of the prostitute, and verse 18 speaks of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the female in this chapter has the aspect of the prostitute, the apostate church, and the aspect of the woman, the physical city of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not easy to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to pray over and ponder certain portions again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I do not know why the Lord in some verses mixes together the various aspects of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I only know that He has done so.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Knowing the various aspects of Babylon is like knowing the prophecies regarding the two comings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In a number of places in the Old Testament Christ s two comings are mentioned together.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is like two mountain ranges that appear to be one when they are viewed from a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But as you approach them, you realize that there is a great gap between them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In reading the prophecies regarding the coming of Christ, we must know which refer to His first coming and which refer to His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is the same with the verses regarding Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must discern which refer to ancient Babylon, which to religious Babylon, and which to material Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we are clear about this, then we shall be able to understand Revelation 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Years ago, I simply could not understand these chapters because I did not know the various aspects of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are clear about these aspects, then we have a solid foundation for understanding these two chapters, and we shall be able to discern which verses concern the religious aspect and which verses concern the material aspect.</S>
