<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISRAEL'S SIN AGAINST JEHOVAH<br>AND<br>JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT UPON ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(11)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JEHOVAH'S CONDEMNATION OF AND PUNISHMENT<br>UPON THE KINGS AND PROPHETS OF JUDAH</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Jer. 21&#151;23</H1><P>In this message we will begin to consider chapters twenty-one through twenty-three. These chapters are concerned with Jehovah's condemnation of and punishment upon the kings and prophets of Judah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEHOVAH'S CONDEMNATION OF AND PUNISHMENT UPON THE KINGS OF JUDAH WITH THEIR PEOPLE</H2><P>In 21:1&#151;23:8 we have a word regarding Jehovah's punishment upon the kings of Judah with their people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah's Condemnation<br>of the Kings of Judah with Their People</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not Listening to Jehovah's Warning<br>to Execute Judgment and Righteousness</H2><P>Jeremiah 22:21 says, "I spoke to you in your prosperity; / But you said, I will not listen. / This has been your way from your youth, / That you have not listened to My voice." Here we see that the kings with their people did not listen to Jehovah's voice. In particular, they did not listen to the warning to execute judgment and righteousness, to deliver him who has been robbed from the hand of the oppressor, and not to mistreat, not to do violence to, the sojourner, the orphan, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in their land (21:12; 22:3, 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Forsaking the Covenant of Jehovah Their God</H2><P>According to 22:9, the kings of Judah with their people forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God and worshipped other gods and served them.</P>
