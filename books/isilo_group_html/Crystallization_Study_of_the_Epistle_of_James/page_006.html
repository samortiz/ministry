Being Justified by Works, Not by Dead Faith,<br>in Supplying the Daily Necessities of the Needy Ones, as Both Abraham and Rahab Were Justified by Their Works After Being Justified by Faith</H2><P>Being justified by our works is a virtue. James said that we need to have the works after we have the faith, just as Abraham and Rahab did (2:14-26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Not Stumbling in Word by Bridling the Tongue</H2><P>James also exhorted the believers not to stumble in word by bridling the tongue (3:1-12). Who can avoid stumbling in word? Often we regret that we spoke some words that stumbled others. The less we speak, the less mistakes we make. The more we speak, the more mistakes we make.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Not Cursing Man, Whom God<br>Made according to His Likeness, by<br>the Mouth with Which One Blesses the Lord</H2><P>James tells us not to curse any man. Even if a man is very bad, very poor, we should not curse him, because he bears the likeness of God (3:9). But often after we bless the Lord, we may curse certain persons. If we honor God, we would not despise one who was made according to God's likeness. This is a virtue.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Behaving in Wisdom</H2><P>James exhorts us to behave in wisdom, showing a good manner of life in meekness, purity, peace, forbearance, compliance, mercy, impartiality, without jealousy, selfish ambition, boasting, lying, and hypocrisy (3:13-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Dealing with Pleasures, the World,<br>and the Devil by Loving God,<br>by the Indwelling Spirit Given by God,<br>and by the Grace Given to the Humble</H2><P>We deal with pleasures, the world, and the devil by three things: by loving God, by the indwelling Spirit given by God, and by the grace given to the humble (James 4:1-10). No doubt, we can do this by the new man not by the old man.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Epistle of James &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
