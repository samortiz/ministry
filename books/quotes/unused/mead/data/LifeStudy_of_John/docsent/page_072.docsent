   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Becoming the Son of Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This great I Am, God Himself in relation to man, became the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For Jehovah to become the Son of Man means that He had to humble Himself, to lower Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was more than necessary due to all the negative problems that are in man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sin is in man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The serpent, the devil, is also in man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man is the focus of every problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God was going to solve all the basic problems of man, He had to become a man Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan knows the importance of this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan was not afraid of the Lord Jesus being the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was afraid of the Lord Jesus being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, Jehovah God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Lifted Up on the Cross for Man</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>to Cast Out the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a man, He was willing to be lifted up 3:14 as was the brass serpent in the wilderness Num 21:4-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we say that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, we mean primarily that He died there for our redemption and removed our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what does the Bible mean when it says that Christ was lifted up?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It mainly refers to His dealing with the serpent, the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When most people read the words lifted up, they lack the understanding of them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Son of Man was lifted up as was the brass serpent not only to deal with sin, but also to deal with the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 12:31-32 indicates that when the Son of Man was lifted up, the ruler of this world, the devil, was judged and cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ was not only crucified He was lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His being lifted up, the serpent was exposed, judged, and cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The serpent, the devil, was judged and cast out by Jesus being lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who was there on the pole?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the flesh of Jesus, God put the serpent on the pole and made a universal display that all the universe might see that His enemy, the serpent, was on the pole.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, Jesus was lifted up for the judging and casting out of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE ASPECTS RELATED TO SIN A. No Man without Sin</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The religionists were trying their best to find fault with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After chapters five and seven they attempted to put Jesus into a difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They caught a sinful woman and brought her to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the law, such a sinful woman had to be stoned to death, but the religionists did not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They brought her to the Lord in an attempt to trap Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They said, Teacher, this woman has been caught committing adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moses commanded us to stone such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What do You say?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The religionists were quite bold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They asked the Lord a very tricky question.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If He had said that they had to stone her to death, then He would have lost His position as the Savior and Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Could a Savior say that such a sinner must be stoned to death?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, the Lord, as the Redeemer and Savior, could not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But, on the other hand, if He said that they should not stone her to death, then they would have said that He was breaking the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This question was a subtle trick of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The religionists thought that they were very wise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually they were stupid.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They thought that the Lord Jesus would find it difficult to answer and that they had an excellent opportunity to catch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Lord was asked this question, He did not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The wisest way to answer a question is not to answer, to answer later on, or to answer slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord s first reaction to their question was not to answer it quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We also must learn this wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When people come to you with an urgent question, you must learn from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He simply stooped to write on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Silence cools people down, like cold water cools boiling water.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Lord stooped to write, He was cooling down the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the same time, by cooling down the hot situation, the sinful woman was comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I believe that by stooping to write on the ground the Lord Jesus was indicating to the religionists that they should not be so proud, that they had to humble themselves a little.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They had to realize that they were as sinful as that woman.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I was young, I tried to discover what it was that the Lord Jesus wrote on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Throughout many generations no one has been able to tell what He wrote.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I would guess that the Lord might have written, Who is without sin among you?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>While the Pharisees were asking what should be done with such a woman, the Lord Jesus might have written in big letters, Who is without sin?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everyone was staring at the Lord as He stooped to write on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then the Lord stood up and said, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her 8:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord seemed to be saying, You may stone her to death, but someone must take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No one is qualified to take the lead in this except the one who is without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Let the one who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This word pierced their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I believe that even before the Lord spoke these words, while He was still writing on the ground, their conscience was touched.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What did the religionists do?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Beginning with the older ones and up until the youngest, they went out one by one 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The oldest, being the wisest, went away first.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They knew that they were not qualified to take the lead in stoning the woman to death.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But they were qualified to take the lead to run away.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All the younger ones followed them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Who is without sin?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No one.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do not condemn others, for while you condemn others you are the same as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You are not qualified to condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You are birds of the same feather.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you condemn another bird, you simply condemn yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only the great I Am is without sin, and only He is qualified to condemn sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What wisdom the Lord Jesus has!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>After the religionists left, notice how lovingly and gently the Lord expressed Himself to the sinful woman.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He asked her if anyone condemned her, and she said, No one, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>That was music to the woman s terrified soul.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This incident manifests the Lord s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The people came to condemn the sinful woman, but the Lord s question convicted them of their own sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When people come to you with questions, you should be careful and turn the question upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You should answer them by asking them about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then you will strike their conscience and convince them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Eventually they will be convicted and run away.</S>
