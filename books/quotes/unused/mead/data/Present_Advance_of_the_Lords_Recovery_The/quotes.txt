[1]  The Present Advance of the Lord s Recovery CONTENTS
[2]  Beginning in August of 1988, the Lord has been speaking to us concerning His organic Body and the organic building up of His Body.
[3]  In this book we want to see the Lord s advanced recovery according to His present speaking.
[4]  We have seen that the divine revelation was completed within the first century, but the truths of the divine revelation were soon lost as the church degraded throughout its history.
[5]  We call the scriptural way to practice the Lord s present recovery the new way because it is new to us, but in fact it is the ancient way to which we must return.
[6]  If only a small percentage of the saints in a local church are able to speak a word for the Lord and serve Him organically, this is a strong sign that this local church is short of the perfecting of the saints.
[7]  I have been in the Lord s recovery for fifty-six years, and I have seen, done, passed through, and experienced many things, yet I must admit that we are short of the organic building of the Body of Christ and short of the perfecting of the saints that they all may share the work of the ministry.
[8]  The Lord wants to recover the perfecting of the saints so that each one part of the Body of Christ may do the work of the New Testament ministry by operating in its measure for the purpose of building up the organic Body of Christ vv.
[9]  In the present advance of the Lord s recovery, He is also moving to recover the church meeting in mutuality 1 Cor 14:23a, 26 .
[10]  The recovery of the organic building up of the Body of Christ, of the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ, and of the church meeting in mutuality fulfills the words in Matthew 16:18, Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26 concerning the building up, in three levels, of the church as the Body of Christ.
[11]  The three levels of building up are as follows: the Head builds up His Body by giving the gifted persons as the joints to His Body Eph 4:11 ; the gifted persons perfect each one part of the Body of Christ v. 12 ; and each one part operates in its measure to build up the Body directly v. 16 . Without the fulfillment of Matthew 16:18, Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26, the Lord cannot come back.
[12]  Today the Lord desires to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ, the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ, and the church meeting in mutuality.
[13]  In order to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes, we have to devote ourselves to the Lord.
[14]  First, we need to devote ourselves to the Lord.
[15]  After coming into the Lord s recovery, we appreciated and treasured the church life.
[16]  When we are living an overcoming life, we abide, remain, stay, in the fellowship with the Lord 1 John 1:6 .
[17]  When we are abiding in fellowship with the Lord, we will speak Christ and function in all kinds of meetings.
[18]  THE LORD S PRESENT RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; Luke 10:3, 5-6; John 15:5, 16a; Acts 5:42; Eph 6:18a; Rom 10:12b; Heb 10:25; Acts 2:46; 12:12; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:3-5, 24, 26
[19]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for all Your divine provisions.
[20]  We have seen the Lord recovering the organic building up of His Body, and we have seen the perfecting of the saints by the gifted persons that all the saints may do the same kind of work that the gifted persons do.
[21]  To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is not to predict but to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into others, which is to dispense the rich Christ into all those attending the meeting.
[22]  Just a short time ago we did not even know him nor did he know us, but now we have imparted Christ into him and he has become a new man, our brother.
[23]  Before people receive the Lord s salvation, their home may be like hell, but when we come to them, bringing them God, God s Word, and God s redemption, that home will become like heaven.
[24]  To save sinners by contacting them where they are and to cherish and nourish the new believers in their homes are the initiation, the beginning, of the way to practice the Lord s present recovery.
[25]  With these three items saving sinners, home meetings, and group meetings there is a building up, yet we still need something more.
[26]  We need all the perfected saints to come together on a larger scale to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, in the church meetings of mutuality 1 Cor 14:26 .
[27]  If a local church has one hundred saints that meet on the Lord s Day, the wisest way for encouraging all the saints to prophesy is to divide these one hundred into two groups of fifty.
[28]  In 1 Corinthians 16, Paul directed the saints to separate a certain amount of their income and offer it to God as a gift on the Lord s Day v. 2 . Paul charged the saints to do this on the first day of the week, not on other days.
[29]  The saints have home meetings and group meetings during the week, but on the Lord s Day morning, they come together to do two things: to remember the Lord, to have the Lord s table, for at most one hour and to have a prophesying meeting.
[30]  When we fully enter into the scriptural way to practice the Lord s present recovery, the entire church with all the believers will be engaged in the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, the home meetings to nourish the young ones, the small group meetings to carry out the practical church life, and the church meetings of mutuality for the worship of God, the remembrance of the Lord, and the organic prophesying.
[31]  CHAPTER FOUR DESIRING AND LEARNING TO PROPHESY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:31, 24, 1, 39,12, 32; Isa 12:2-5; Lam 3:22-26; Luke 1:46-55, 67-79
[32]  The first step in practicing the Lord s present recovery is to get sinners saved for the Lord.
[33]  Following this we need to have home meetings with the newly baptized ones, and then we need to group them together to teach them, to perfect them, to equip them, to furnish them, so that they can do the same work that the gifted persons do to build up the Body of Christ.
[34]  For the sake of the Lord s present move, we all need to make a budget of our time.
[35]  We have to separate certain hours and devote these hours to the Lord.
[36]  Many of us have free time on the weekends, so this may be the proper time that we can devote to the Lord for the present advance of His recovery.
[37]  In Matthew 25 the Lord told us the parable of the talents.
[38]  The Lord has given us a talent, and now we have to use this talent to make some interest for the Lord.
[39]  When we go out to knock on doors and we see the people, we should say, Praise the Lord!
[40]  For the Lord to gain the organic building up of His Body, we need to pursue and desire to prophesy, seeking to be rich in this excelling gift for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.
[41]  The conclusion of the scriptural way to build up the Body of Christ is that we all have to learn to prophesy.
[42]  He is recovering the organic building up of His Body, the perfecting by the gifts of all the saints that they may do the same work of the New Testament ministry that the gifted ones do to build up the Body of Christ, and the church meeting in mutuality.
[43]  The patterns of prophesying can be seen with Isaiah and Jeremiah in the Old Testament and with Mary and Zachariah in the New Testament.
[44]  He speaks the Lord in these verses: Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.
[45]  In this portion of the Word, Isaiah speaks the Lord, speaks forth the Lord, and speaks the Lord into all of us.
[46]  In this chapter and the next chapter, we shall fellowship concerning the Lord s move and the present need of the Lord s recovery.
[47]  First, in this chapter we shall see our need for prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[48]  The Lord s move today, the new way, consummates in the building up of the Body of Christ, and the way to build up the Body is by prophesying.
[49]  God has a plan, an eternal purpose, which He made in eternity past for eternity future Eph 3:11 .
[50]  God s dispensation is His arrangement, His plan, for dispensing the riches of Christ into God s people.
[51]  God s family plan, God s family administration, is to distribute, to dispense, all the divine riches in Christ into His saved ones for their nourishment and feeding, resulting in the building up of the Body of Christ.
[52]  Prophesying is the unique way, the best way, the excelling way, to dispense all the riches of Christ into God s people for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.
[53]  In the fall of 1986, we started to have a formal training in Taipei because there were at least three or four hundred college graduates who desired to give their time to serve the Lord.
[54]  We discovered that four things are crucial for the new way: the preaching of the gospel, the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the church meetings.
[55]  The book of 1 Corinthians begins with the enjoyment of Christ as our portion 1:9 and consummates with prophesying.
[56]  As we have mentioned before, verse 3 says that to prophesy is to speak the building up of the Body of Christ, encouragement for the divine goal, and consolation for the saints.
[57]  Paul taught many things, but all his teachings consummate in his word that we can all speak for God, we can all prophesy one by one v. 31 . Paul wrote fourteen Epistles, and by God s sovereignty they have been preserved for many centuries.
[58]  If we exercise a sober mind and a very clear spirit, we will be qualified to learn to prophesy, that is, to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak Christ into people, to minister and dispense the Christ whom we enjoy into others.
[59]  As I mentioned in the previous chapter, a burden came to me in October of 1984 concerning the situation in the Lord s recovery at that time.
[60]  I knew that preaching the gospel by going to people where they are was the first step for the new way, but I was not yet enlightened to fully see the following steps.
[61]  In the summer of 1988, though, I began to see that after the preaching of the gospel, we must have meetings in mutuality by prophesying 1 Cor 14 through the perfecting by the gifted persons Eph 4:11-16 .
[62]  The stress and emphasis of 1 Corinthians 14 is not simply on meeting but on prophesying, on every member of the Body of Christ speaking for the Lord.
[63]  Every member of the Body can speak for the Lord.
[64]  Certain saints had been under my ministry for over thirty-five years, but they still could not speak even a short word to save sinners.
[65]  Our practice in the past, the old way, was mainly to build up a congregation.
[66]  The old way can never build up the organic Body of Christ.
[67]  We can now see the two ends of the new way.
[68]  The new way begins with visiting people for the preaching of the gospel to gain sinners for the increase, and it culminates with building them up through meetings of mutuality in which everyone speaks forth the Lord.
[69]  We must learn to practice to preach the gospel by visiting people, to have home meetings to nourish the babes, to have group meetings to teach them the truths, and then to have the church meetings to build them up by the mutual speaking forth of Christ.
[70]  This is accomplished by the wide spreading of the gospel of Christ by visiting people for the producing of the new believers, by home meetings to nourish the new believers, by group meetings to take care of the saints and teach them the truth for their edification, and by church meetings to exhibit and minister Christ to the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ by the developing and exercising of the saints organic functions.
