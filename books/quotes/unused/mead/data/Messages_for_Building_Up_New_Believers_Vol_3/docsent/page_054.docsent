   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. No Experience Coming to Us by Accident</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The question today is: What kind of response do we have when others give us an ugly look?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If their look is God s discipline, how should we react?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If our business fails because others have forgotten to do something for us, how should we react?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the poor memory of another person is God s discipline to us, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we become sick through another s infection, how should we deal with it?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If things turn sour through various misfortunes, what do we say?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If things do not go our way because God s discipline is behind them, what should we say?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brothers and sisters, the response to all these things makes a great difference in us!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can consider everything in our environment as being a mere encounter; this is one kind of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can also consider it to be God s discipline; this is another kind of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The words of the apostle here are very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He says that it is for discipline that we endure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please do not consider all these things to be unendurable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not conclude foolishly that they are mere coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must realize that God daily arranges these things and measures them for our discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Discipline Being God s Dealing</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>with Us as with Sons</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 7 continues, God deals with you as with sons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God deals with us as with sons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What we experience is God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today all discipline comes to us because He deals with us as with sons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please bear in mind that discipline is God s way of honoring us, not afflicting us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many hold the wrong concept that they are disciplined by God because God wants to torture them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are disciplined by God because God is honoring us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He deals with us as with sons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Discipline is God s honoring of us!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have become God s sons; therefore, we must be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God disciplines us in order to bring us to the place of blessing and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should never think that we are tormented by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>D. Seeing the Father s Hand</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We see a big contrast when a person understands that what is happening to him is of God; he will have a different view toward his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If someone hits me with a cane today, I may argue with him or snatch the cane from him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I may break it and throw it back in his face.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have not done him any injustice in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if my Father chastises me with the cane, can I snatch the cane, break it, and throw it back?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the contrary, we feel somewhat privileged that our Father would discipline us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Madam Guyon said, I will kiss the whip that chastises me!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I will kiss the hand that buffets me!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please remember that this is the Father s hand and the Father s rod.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is different.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If it were some ordinary experience, we would not miss anything by rejecting it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But this is no ordinary encounter; this is God s hand and God s chastisement, the goal of which is to make us a partaker of His nature and character.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once we see this, we will not murmur and complain.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as a person realizes that his Father is the one who is dealing with him, his feelings change.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our God is dealing with us as with sons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a glory that He disciplines us today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>E. Discipline Being the Proof That We Are Sons</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 8 says, But if you are without discipline, of which all sons have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Remember that discipline is the proof that one is a son.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s sons are those who are disciplined by Him, and those who are without discipline are not His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A person has no proof that he is a son of God if he is not disciplined by God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The proof that one is a son is the discipline he receives.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All sons have become partakers of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every child of God needs to be disciplined, and you are no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Unless you are illegitimate, one who is adopted or bought, you must accept the same discipline!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The apostle s word here is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All sons have become partakers of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not expect to be treated differently if you are a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All sons have become partakers of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everyone is treated the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everyone who lived in Paul s time or Peter s time experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today this is true for everyone in every nation throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No one is exempted.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You cannot take a way which no other child of God has ever walked.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No child of God has ever taken a way that is free from discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If any child of God is foolish enough to think that there can be smooth sailing in his living and work and that he can be spared God s discipline, he is saying that he is illegitimate, that is, one who is adopted.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must see that discipline is the sign and proof that we are God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who are without discipline are illegitimate; they belong to other families and are not members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If God does not discipline us, it means that we do not belong to His family.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Let me mention something that I once saw.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It may not be that profound, yet it serves as a good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Five or six children were playing rambunctiously together; their bodies were covered in mud.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When the mother of three of the children came, she spanked her children on their hands and forbade them to dirty themselves again.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After she spanked them, one asked, Why did you not spank the others?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The mother answered, They are not my children.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No mother wants to discipline other people s children.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It would be terrible if God did not discipline us!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Those who are without discipline are illegitimate, not sons!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have truly believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Since the first day of our Christian life, chastisement has been coming our way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We cannot remain a child of God yet be spared discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We cannot receive the sonship of God without receiving chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>These two things go together.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We cannot receive the sonship without accepting the discipline!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All sons must be disciplined, and we are no exception.</S>
