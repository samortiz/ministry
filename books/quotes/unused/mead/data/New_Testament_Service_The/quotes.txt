[1]  It is a service that is of the Holy Spirit with the goal to bring forth Christ for the fulfillment of His purpose; it is living, fresh, and without any natural concept or element, having the living, instant guidance of Christ that brings us to Himself.
[2]  CHAPTER ONE CONCEIVING AND BRINGING FORTH CHRIST Scripture Reading: Luke 1:26-38; Matt 1:18-23; 2 Cor 3:5-6; Gal 1:15-16; Rom 1:9
[3]  The opening chapters of the New Testament present a clear picture of the New Testament service, a service that is outside of religion and one that is living, fresh, and up-to-date, a service with Christ Himself.
[4]  As we shall see, the goal of such a service is simply to bring forth Christ.
[5]  In these pages we will trace the New Testament service in the Gospel of Matthew from its beginning with the conceiving of Christ of the Holy Spirit, to finding Christ by following the heavenly living star, on to testifying of Christ in a living way, and then to the matter of following Christ.
[6]  In all these aspects, it is a governing principle in our service in the church life that the New Testament service is a service of coordination in every step to fulfill the Lord s purpose.
[7]  Furthermore, according to the principle in the New Testament, the service began with a young girl, a virgin.
[8]  Even in the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus fed the five thousand with five loaves and two fishes, we are told that there were five thousand men, besides women and children Matt 14:21 .
[9]  Furthermore, the New Testament service is something completely initiated by God.
[10]  If it were something of the old way of religion, there would have been some idea or concept there already, but this was something initiated by God.
[11]  What we have pointed out in the preceding chapter can be summarized as four main principles of New Testament service.
[12]  As we mentioned, the first instance in the New Testament is the birth of Jesus Christ, showing us the principles of New Testament service.
[13]  If we go out to spread the church life in a way that is so marvelous, so noble, a way that causes us to be so boastful, such a way proves that we are wrong and that we are not in the Lord s recovery.
[14]  In a sense, whenever we carry on the New Testament service, that is again the birth of Jesus, for the birth of Christ is simply to bring forth Christ to people.
[15]  It begins with the birth of Christ in chapter one, and it ends with the church going forth to meet Christ in chapter twenty-five.
[16]  It begins with one virgin bringing forth Christ, and it ends with ten virgins going forth to meet Christ.
[17]  If we are not virgins, we have nothing to do with Christ, and if we are not virgins, we have nothing to do with the church.
[18]  Regardless of how much we could do for the Lord, we need to say, Lord, I would be nothing but a virgin to bring forth Christ.
[19]  The second principle in the case of the birth of Jesus is that there is no human effort, human strength, human doings, or human working.
[20]  There is no need for us to do something for the Lord, but there is the need that the Lord work something into us.
[21]  Praise the Lord, we all need to learn this one principle: the New Testament service is not a matter of the mere teachings that we have, but a matter of the presence of the Lord in the Holy Spirit.
[22]  CHAPTER THREE JOSEPH S SIDE OF THE BIRTH OF JESUS Scripture Reading: Matt 1:18-20; Luke 2:1-7; Matt 2:11, 13-15, 19-23; Luke 3:23, 31b; 1:31-33; Matt 1:16, 6b, 12; Jer 22:30; 23:5
[23]  In the two preceding chapters we have seen four main points related to New Testament service.
[24]  It should be conceived of the Holy Spirit, and it should bring forth Christ.
[25]  In the preceding chapters we have seen only Mary s side of the birth of Christ, but there is another aspect the side of Joseph.
[26]  The Lord may grant you the favor of conceiving Christ, but the Lord will not grant you the leading and guidance so that you will know where to go and what to do.
[27]  The angel of the Lord appeared to Mary concerning the conceiving of Jesus.
[28]  However, when it was necessary to move from the land of Israel to Egypt, the angel did not come to Mary, but to Joseph.
[29]  The leading and guidance of the Lord s move does not come through you, but through another to whom you are related.
[30]  If you would know the Lord s will regarding your move and the things you need to do, you need Joseph.
[31]  You may be absolutely out of religion and so much in the Holy Spirit to bring forth Christ, but if you do not have Joseph, you still do not know what to do and you do not have the Lord s leading.
[32]  Now we need to go on from coordination to the matter of guidance.
[33]  AFTER THE BIRTH OF JESUS Scripture Reading: Luke 3:23; 2:39b, 42-43, 46, 48-49; John 2:3-4; 19:26-27; 1:45-46; 7:41-42; Matt 13:55-57a; 12:46-50; 2 Cor 5:16; Isa 53:2-3; Num 27:8; 1 Chron 3:5; Jer 22:28-30
[34]  In the beginning of the New Testament, there is the wonderful case of Mary and Joseph, showing us that the matter of bringing forth Christ can only be accomplished through coordination.
[35]  The genealogy of Christ is a record showing us how Christ is brought forth.
[36]  The coordination to accomplish the bringing forth of Christ can be seen in the two genealogies of Christ, one in Matthew and the other in Luke.
[37]  The Bible does not say that Christ is the descendant of Solomon, but it says that He is the seed of Abraham, the seed of Isaac, the seed of Jacob, the seed of Jesse, and the seed of David.
[38]  Why does the Bible not say that Christ is the descendant of Solomon?
[39]  Christ is the seed of David, but not the seed of Jeconiah; therefore, the curse that fell on Jeconiah has nothing to do with the Lord Jesus.
[40]  OF THE HEAVENLY STAR Scripture Reading: Matt 2:1-12; John 1:45-47a; 7:40-42, 52; Matt 13:55-56; 22:43; 2 Cor 5:16 THE PRINCIPLE OF COORDINATION
[41]  We have seen very clearly that the New Testament service is simply to bring forth Christ.
[42]  We may bring forth Christ in life, yet we may not have the position; therefore, we need others to position us.
[43]  We need to worship God for His sovereignty in bringing Mary to Joseph and preparing Joseph for Mary, in order that, in such a coordination, Christ might be brought forth to the human race.
[44]  There is the need for someone to bring forth Christ, and there is also the need for someone to find Christ and to worship Him as the wise men did.
[45]  In the birth of Jesus, Mary and Joseph brought forth Christ by coordination.
[46]  Therefore, we need to consider carefully the account in Matthew 2 of the wise men finding Christ, that we too in this present day may be numbered among those who truly find the living Christ.
[47]  They asked the Lord Jesus, In the resurrection, therefore, of which of the seven will she be the wife? v. 28 . The Lord Jesus also chose a portion of Scripture and answered, Have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living vv.
[48]  Now consider what the wise men did: they saw the heavenly star and they followed it, but they made a great mistake.
[49]  I do believe that if they had not turned to their natural concept, but continually looked away to the star in the sky, the star would have gone before them all the time, leading them directly to the place where Jesus was.
[50]  Based upon the same principle, let us look at the case of Nathanael in John 1.
[51]  Philip found Jesus and came to Nathanael and told him that he had found Christ, that he had found the One of whom Moses and the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph John 1:45 .
[52]  If you say that Jesus is the son of Joseph, I will say that He is not the son of Joseph He was born of Mary.
[53]  In John chapter seven there is another case of finding Christ.
[54]  Christ was doing some marvelous things, and the people were saying, This is truly the prophet.
[55]  AND BY BECOMING STARS IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Num 24:17; Matt 2:2, 9-10; 2 Pet 1:19; Rev 2:28; 22:16b, 17a; 1:16a, 20; 2:1; 3:1; Dan 12:3; Jude 12-13; Matt 13:43a THE STAR THROUGHOUT THE BIBLE
[56]  This matter of the star is not only in the book of Matthew.
[57]  So many of us have proved this by our experience: when we were in religion we simply had the sense of being in darkness, but when the Lord brought us into the local churches, hallelujah, we saw the star, the brightness of the star.
[58]  In the Bible we see how we may not only follow the star, but even become one of the stars.
[59]  The Lord said unto Abraham, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore Gen 22:17 .
[60]  There is also a negative aspect to the stars the wandering stars.
[61]  Jude 12 and 13 tell us, These are hidden reefs in your love feasts, feasting together with you without fear, shepherds that feed themselves, waterless clouds, carried along by winds, autumn trees without fruit, having died twice, rooted up...wandering stars, for whom the gloom of darkness has been kept for eternity.
[62]  CHAPTER SEVEN TESTIFYING FOR CHRIST Scripture Reading: Luke 1:13-17, 57-63, 80; Matt 3:1-12; 4:12; 11:2-6, 11, 18; 14:3-12; 21:25
[63]  In the preceding chapters, we have covered two cases in the book of Matthew.
[64]  The first case is that of conceiving Christ and bringing Him forth, as seen in Mary and Joseph, and the second is the case of the heathen wise men finding Christ.
[65]  John s way of living not only offended religion, but it also offended culture.
[66]  He was not only outside of religion, but also outside of culture.
[67]  We all need to realize that, if we would give a strong testimony for Christ, we need to be completely outside of religion and outside of tradition.
[68]  To be the living witnesses of Christ, we need to be outside of religion and outside of culture, and we may find that we offend the religious ones and the cultured ones.
[69]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE TESTIMONY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST Scripture Reading: Matt 3:1-2, 8-12; John 1:6-7, 19-20, 29-36; 3:25-30
[70]  We have seen that there are four cases of New Testament service in the book of Matthew, the case of conceiving and bringing forth Christ, the case of finding Christ, the case of testifying for Christ, and the case of following Christ.
[71]  All of these main activities concerning Christ are outside of religion.
[72]  Mary conceived and brought forth Christ outside of Judaism, and the heathen wise men found Christ outside of Judaism.
[73]  In addition, John the Baptist bore witness and testified of Christ outside of Judaism, and Peter, James, and John with the other disciples followed Christ in a way that was also outside of religion.
[74]  He did not care for religion because he realized that religion is a substitute for Christ, and he did not care for culture because he realized that culture is a preoccupation to the people who were made for Christ.
[75]  He was outside of religion for Christ, and he had nothing to do with religion because it keeps people away from Christ.
[76]  We should not be different from religion and culture because we are dissatisfied with them we should be different because we are filled up with Christ!
[77]  The second point of John s positive testimony for Christ is the kingdom of heaven.
[78]  I could not have imagined that such a thing could have happened among the young people of this country, but I do know that the one who has caused all of this is Satan, the enemy of God.
[79]  The next four points of John s message are all related to Christ: Christ is the Son of God, Christ is the Lamb of God, Christ is the Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, and Christ is also the Bridegroom.
[80]  After testifying that we need to be in the right position, John s first point concerning Christ is that He is the Son of God John 1:34 .
[81]  To testify that Christ is the Son of Man is easy, but to testify that He is the Son of God is not so easy.
[82]  When we preach the gospel, we need to tell people that Christ is the Son of God, and the Son of God means the expression of God, the manifestation of God.
[83]  The last point which John testified for Christ is that He is the Bridegroom John 3:29 .
[84]  John was clear concerning who the Lord was, but John s disciples were not clear.
[85]  Nevertheless, John told them, I said, I am not the Christ....He who has the bride is the bridegroom....He must increase, but I must decrease John 3:28-30 .
[86]  CHAPTER NINE FOLLOWING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Matt 4:12-22; 5:1-2, 13-16; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 1:10; 1 Thes 3:10; Gal 6:1
[87]  Following the case of John the Baptist is the fourth case in Matthew, the case of the disciples following Christ.
[88]  When the Lord appeared to James and John, they were not fishing, but mending their nets.
[89]  If I am called to be a fisher, I should be fishing all the time to bring people in. If I have been called to be a mender, I need to learn how to build people up, how to perfect the saints, and how to add something of Christ to them that they might be in harmony in the Body.
[90]  CHAPTER TEN FOUR NEW THINGS Scripture Reading: Matt 9:10, 14-17; Luke 5:29, 33-39
[91]  After the fourth case concerning the following of Christ in Matthew, there is what is called the Sermon on the Mount, which covers chapters five, six, and seven.
[92]  Then in chapter eight the Lord Jesus came down from the mountain, and there were more who followed Him.
[93]  It is in chapter nine that Matthew the publican, who is also called Levi, was called to follow the Lord.
[94]  And it came to pass as He was reclining at the table in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined at the table together with Jesus and His disciples....Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?
[95]  Now we need to look into these four new things that the Lord mentioned in these verses, realizing that He used these things to illustrate something of Himself.
[96]  The Lord used not only the new cloth and the new garment to illustrate something of Himself, but also the new wine.
[97]  In the New Testament service, it is not merely a matter of outward expression, but also of inward content.
[98]  We need the Lord Jesus as our new garment without, and we need Him even more as our new wine within.
[99]  Therefore, we see that after the four cases in chapters one through four of Matthew, chapter nine shows us the proper way to be with the Lord Jesus in the New Testament service; that is, there should always be something new.
[100]  CHAPTER ELEVEN CONFIRMED BY THE LORD S TEACHING Scripture Reading: Matt 11:18-19; 12:1-14, 39-42 THE LIFE OF WISDOM
[101]  We have seen four cases from the New Testament concerning service.
[102]  The third case was the testifying for Christ, and the fourth case was following Christ.
[103]  Some may say that this is simply our way to interpret these four cases; therefore, we do need confirmation from the Lord s own teaching.
[104]  The second case is found in Matthew 12:1-8.
[105]  At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grainfields; and His disciples were hungry and began to pick the ears and to eat.
[106]  And He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?
[107]  Then the Lord referred the Pharisees to another passage of Scripture.
[108]  CHAPTER TWELVE JESUS ONLY Scripture Reading: Matt 16:13-17; 17:1-8, 24-27
[109]  When we read these passages in Matthew 16 and 17, we see that they are altogether for Christ and about Christ.
[110]  To serve in the New Testament dispensation, we need to be very clear about Christ.
[111]  The New Testament service is a matter altogether of Christ, for Christ, with Christ, and in Christ.
[112]  In the first chapter of Matthew we have seen the conceiving of Christ, and in the second chapter, the finding of Christ.
[113]  There is the conceiving of Christ, the finding of Christ, the testifying of Christ, and the following of Christ, but who is Christ?
[114]  Peter, James, and John, with the others, were all followers of Christ, but there was nevertheless the problem of who Christ is.
[115]  Yes, we follow Christ, but do we know who Christ is?
[116]  However, there is another portion in Matthew 17, a portion describing another event which occurred a short time after the transfiguration.
[117]  By these few words, Peter became quite clear that the Lord need not pay the tribute.
[118]  Then the Lord said, in effect, Nevertheless, lest we offend them, we should pay.
[119]  In my experience very often when I said Yes, the Lord Jesus would say No. And then when I followed Him to say No, He would then say Yes.
[120]  If you will not misunderstand me, I will say also that because we have Christ, we do not need the Bible in the same way that we need Christ.
[121]  THE QUESTION OF QUESTIONS Scripture Reading: Matt 21:23-27; 22:15-46
[122]  By this time the Pharisees realized that it was not so easy to deal with this Jesus; therefore, they asked their disciples to go to Him with the Herodians.
[123]  And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are true, and that you teach the way of God in truth and do not care for anyone, for you do not regard the person of men.
[124]  When the Pharisees saw that the Sadducees were put to silence by Jesus, a learned one among them came and tried to tempt Him with another question.
[125]  Jesus answered the lawyer, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
[126]  They say to Him, David s. He says to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his Son? And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him any more Matt 22:41-46 .
[127]  They knew doctrinally that Christ was the Son of David, but they did not have the revelation in the spirit that this Christ who is, on one hand, the Son of David, is also the Lord of all.
[128]  If we see the person and being of Christ, however, we will see that the fact that Christ is the Son of David means that He is the Son of Man; yet He is nevertheless the Lord of David because He is the very God, the Lord of all.
[129]  OF LIFE AND WORK Scripture Reading: Matt 25:1-30
[130]  We have seen that the New Testament service is simply to conceive Christ of the Holy Spirit, to find Christ by following the heavenly living star, to testify of Christ in a living way, and to follow Him in the way of the two ministries, the ministry of fishing and that of mending.
[131]  We have also seen that all our service needs to be outside of religion and that it should be a living service, fresh and up-to-date, with Christ Himself.
[132]  On one hand, we are the virgins to Christ, but on the other hand, we are His slaves.
[133]  We are not only the virgins going forth to meet Him; we are also the slaves serving Him.
[134]  In the parable of the ten virgins we need the extra portion of oil, but in the parable of the talents, for the kingdom of the heavens we need the trading of the talents.
[135]  And he also who received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter; and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours.
