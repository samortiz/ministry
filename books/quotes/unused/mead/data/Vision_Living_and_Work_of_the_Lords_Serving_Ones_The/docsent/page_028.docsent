   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE LIFE AND NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When leading new believers to know the church, we first should let them know that Christ is the life and nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we were regenerated, the Lord entered into us to be our life and our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some believers do not understand why we say that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether or not we are the church depends on whether Christ is our life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In reference to the church as the new man, Colossians 3:11 says, There cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the new man, which is the church, there is no Jew, no Greek, no high culture, no low culture, no slave, and no free man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the new man there is only one constituent, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the constituent of all the members of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is not only in all the members; He is the members.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the new man Christ is you and Christ is me; Christ is everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we lead new believers, we need to bring them step by step from knowing Christ to knowing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As they receive revelation and gain knowledge and experiences of Christ, they will be transformed from clay into stones for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning the church, we first must speak to them about Matthew 16 so that they may know that the church is universal and that it is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we should go to Matthew 18 and speak concerning the local church and concerning the living of the church life in every locality as the expression of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our practice of the church life, we must maintain a proper relationship with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>AS HIS FULLNESS TO EXPRESS HIM</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must help new believers to see that the element, constituent, nature, and essence of the church are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is also the life of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At this point we can quote Ephesians 5:23-32 concerning the church being the wife of Christ and Christ being the Husband of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can also use Genesis 2:21-24 to show that Adam and Eve were of one flesh; Eve came out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Adam s essence was Eve s essence, and Adam s life was Eve s life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eve was a part of Adam; hence, the two were one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In God s eyes these two persons were one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Adam is a type of Christ, and Eve is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as Eve was built out of Adam s rib, so the church is produced by the living water of life that flowed out of the side of Christ when He was crucified John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as Eve came out of Adam, so the church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The body implies fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 1:23 refers to the church in verse 22, saying that it is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If Adam were a bachelor, he would have no fullness, for he would be like a head without a body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When God built Eve out of Adam, he obtained a fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as Eve was Adam s fullness, so the church is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church comes out of Christ, and the life and nature of the church are Christ; hence, the church is Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After we are saved, we become members of this Body; and all the members are one Body, which is the fullness of Christ to express Him, just as Eve was Adam s fullness to express Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In summary, the life and nature of the church are Christ, the church is Christ s Body, the church is the fullness of Christ, and the church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the light that the Lord has shown us during the past thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>MINISTERING LIFE AND AVOIDING DEBATES</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After leading a person to salvation, we should not immediately speak to him concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This can be compared to giving meat to a newborn baby.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We first should lead a new believer to pray, to contact the Lord, and to confess his sins to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is too soon to lead a new believer to know the church within the first three months of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If an unbeliever has questions concerning the church, we should not be quick to answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we should first determine whether or not he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we should turn him from the matter of the church to salvation, leading him to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is easy for him to misunderstand us if we speak to him about the church before he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He may think that we are condemning everyone except ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, he will be unreceptive to our speaking and may even become negative.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, we should not speak concerning the church; instead, we should minister to him regarding salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the Lord touches him, later it will be easy for him to receive what we say about other matters, such as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we speak about the church, we should never debate doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not arguing who is right or who is wrong; neither are we boasting about our merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should always supply others with life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we can always give others spiritual help, they will be impressed with us; they will also be grateful to us and appreciate us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then, when we speak to them concerning the church, they will receive what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all have the flesh; hence, we should avoid debates.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether we are preaching the gospel, leading new believers in the experiences of life, or speaking concerning the church, we should try our best to avoid debates.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once the person we are speaking with harbors a negative feeling toward us, it will be difficult to continue the conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No one likes to be wrong, and debates close the door to future conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must not give new believers the impression that we are condemning others faults or criticizing their shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We desire to lead them in life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order to give people the gospel and the light of the truth and to help them abide in the Lord and grow in life, we should learn to always avoid debates.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should speak only as much as others can receive so that they will receive the supply and be left with a good impression.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then it will be possible to have further contact and to preach the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should never tear down the work done by the Protestant denominations or any other group.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In 1937 I was assigned by the work to labor in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The brothers told me that I had a good knowledge of the truth, and that this truth, which is the light that the Lord has given to us, is not only for us but also for the brothers and sisters in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I traveled from Shantung to Hopeh, Suiyuan, Shansi, Shensi, and Honan and discovered that the Catholic Church had done much work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although there were many mistakes and the work was leavened, the gospel had been preached to people.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>People had been taught to know the God who created heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They had been told that Jesus is the Son of God; He is the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They also had been told that Jesus Christ is the Savior of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, while laboring in these provinces, I never denied this work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to be fair and not annul the work that others have done.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In this way the people whom we contact will receive what we minister; they will be able to receive further help from us.</S>
