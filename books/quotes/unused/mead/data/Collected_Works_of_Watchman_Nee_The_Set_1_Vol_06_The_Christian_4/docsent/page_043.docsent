   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Second Way to Hell:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Making Excuses</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two kinds of excuses, one unintentional and the other intentional.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unintentional excuses are made when someone thinks that something is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His heart is not in the matter, and he makes some excuses to shuffle the matter away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Intentional excuses are made when someone knows that a matter is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet he makes excuses to get away from it because he is unwilling to face it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Unintentional excuses are the result of ignorance; one excuses himself because he does not know the importance of the matter at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such ignorance can be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If someone explains the importance of a matter and he still does not care, taking an indifferent attitude or making excuses, he errs in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Intentional excuses are the result of unwillingness in the heart; one knows that a matter is important, yet he makes excuses and declines to take the proper action because of his unwillingness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is senseless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How senseless it is when, despite knowing that something ought to be done, one refuses to do it simply because he does not want to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there is anyone here who declines to believe in Christ as his Savior, he is either making unintentional or intentional excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do not know the importance of this matter, you should listen to what I am saying in order to realize its importance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please do not make excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please seek after the truth with an open attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not hold onto any prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not think that the future is not an important issue and that you can, therefore, reject these words easily.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you know that it is important to believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved, then your excuses are intentional if you reject these words through your unwilling heart, fear of men, or dislike of men's mocking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How unreasonable is such an excuse!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people come to our preaching with a prejudice in them already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They think that they are just coming to listen and will never believe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When others persuade them to believe, they make many excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let me tell you something: your real difficulty is not your excuses but your prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you do not have any prejudice, you will see that your excuses are without reason and that you do not have any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we have to read the Bible and consider what the Bible says concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Luke 14:15-24 tells a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It says that a man set up a feast and invited many guests to come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"And he sent his slave at the dinner hour to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all things are now ready.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And they all with one consent began to make excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and I need to go out and see it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I ask you, have me excused.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to prove them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I ask you, have me excused.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And another said, I have married a wife, and because of this I cannot come" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All these made excuses and would not go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This parable was given by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It tells us that God has prepared a gospel feast for the world to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man does not have to pay any price; he only needs to believe and come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet he makes excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Matthew 22:7 the Lord Jesus points out the end of the ones who excused themselves: "And the king became angry...and destroyed those...."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who do not receive God's grace, refusing with unreasonable excuses, will end in nothing other than perdition and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just imagine: God has prepared grace for man and made it possible for man to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All that man needs to do is believe and receive this grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet man uses many unreasonable excuses to refuse God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is there any end for them other than perdition?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many do know that it is important to believe in the Lord Jesus now.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They know that they have sinned and that their own sin will bring them to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They know that the Lord Jesus has died for them and that they will be saved if they will receive with faith the merit of the Lord Jesus' death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But due to an unwillingness of heart, they devise many false excuses to reject the Lord Jesus as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There may be many reasons for such unwillingness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in reality it is simply unwillingness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All these excuses are due merely to unwillingness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Oh, how foolish this is!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If it is right for one to believe, he ought to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If it is not right to believe, he should not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How senseless it is to know that you ought to believe and yet refuse to do so because there are other loves in your heart!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How foolish it is to know that a medicine will heal you and yet decline it because you dislike the medicine and then die instead!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When many people hear the gospel, they excuse themselves by saying that they are too busy, that they do not have the time to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is unreasonable to excuse themselves this way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, even though it takes time to believe in the Lord Jesus, not much time is required.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Second, if a matter is important, one should lay down secondary matters to take care of the more important one, even though there is not much time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you think that the salvation of your soul is important, you should set aside the time to believe even if you do not have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is no reason for making such excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some are afraid that they may not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are afraid that they may become a laughingstock to others and that this is much worse than not doing anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But why do you ignore God's promise?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God told us, "He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus" Phil 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If God has helped you and enabled you to believe and if it is God who has begun in you this good work, He will surely complete it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What else do you have to fear?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some excuse themselves by saying that they do not understand this doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But the Bible tells us that first we believe, then we understand.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since some do not understand many teachings in Christianity, they wonder how they can believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This excuse is also without a good reason.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I only need to ask you one thing: do you know that you are a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do you know that your sins deserve punishment and that the Lord Jesus has borne this punishment for you?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you know this, you should believe in the Lord Jesus; there is no reason for you to excuse yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You may not understand other doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But if you are unwilling to enter the door, how can you see the scene within the house?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are many mysterious things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Although they cannot be explained by words, the Lord will help a man to experience them and will remove any doubt about them after he has believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Take the illustration of an elementary school student going to school.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He tells his parents that he has never learned anything in the school and therefore does not want to go to school.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Knowledgeable parents will tell him that they are sending him to the school precisely because he does not know.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If he knows already, there is no need to send him to school.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You have to believe in the Lord Jesus because you do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you understood, why would you have to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Those who do not read a book do not understand the book.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the same way, if you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, you will not understand the mysteries in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Some have excused themselves by saying that there are many bad people in the church whose behavior is worse than their own, even though they are unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Why then, they ask, do they have to believe in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I admit that in the so-called church today there are many whose conduct is indeed bad.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But we should not give up eating just because our throat feels uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>These people come to the church because of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Many others come with other motives.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>These should not be considered as believers in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They have merely "joined a religion."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When a student learns calligraphy by copying some writing and does not copy well, we cannot blame it on the original writing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Even though some who have learned of the Lord Jesus have failures, we cannot say that the Lord Jesus is not worthy of our belief.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If you say this, let me advise you: if you do not choose to believe in the Lord Jesus, I have nothing more to say, but if you choose to believe in Him, do not be the kind of Christian mentioned above; otherwise, you will stumble others!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Strictly speaking, all excuses are unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I can mention many kinds of excuses; but one thing is sure: there is no reason for any excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Since it is called an "excuse," it is surely without a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Since it is called an "excuse," you know that even though something is required, you are using an excuse to keep from doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Some say that their excuses are good.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>No matter how good the excuse appears to be, as long as it is used as an excuse it is an excuse, and as long as it is an excuse, there are untruth, falsehood, and other motives behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>There is no reason for any excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Therefore, please do not make any excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Many times gospel preachers persuade others to believe in the cross of the Lord Jesus for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But some people still do not want to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>As I am standing here today, I think of the people to whom I have preached the gospel and who have declined me.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Where are they now?</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Some have died and entered eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>They are now suffering in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>They regret the fact that they rejected so lightly and refused to accept the Lord Jesus as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Now they are suffering the punishment of their rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Many others are still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>What are they doing now?</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Not only are they short of the standard of God's holiness and glory, they cannot even come up to the standard of the worldly morality.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>They are fallen; their humanity is now in ruin.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Would they have degraded to such a state if they had received the Lord Jesus as their Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Those who make excuses will go to hell because the Lord Jesus has no way to save those who make excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Let me speak an honest word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Suppose you make an excuse now and do not accept Christ as your Savior; you may not have any regrets even while you are alive, and you may not have any regrets when you are about to die, but you will have regrets after you die and enter eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Why wait until later to regret?</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Is it not far better to believe in the Lord Jesus today?</S>
