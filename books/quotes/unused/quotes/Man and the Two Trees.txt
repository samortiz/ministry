At the very beginning of the Scriptures, God is seen creating man as the center of the whole creation for the purpose of expressing Himself
At the beginning of the Word of God, we are shown two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
In order to understand God's plan in Scripture, we must be thoroughly clear about these two trees and what they represent
According to the revelation of the whole Scripture, the tree of life signifies God Himself in Christ as our life
We can sit under Him as the shade-under His covering and shadow-and enjoy all His riches, the fruit of the tree
From the very beginning of time, these two trees represent two sources-one, the source of life, and the other, the source of death
It was Gods intention for this neutral innocent man to take God into himself that God and man man and God would be mingled together as one
When he took the fruit of the tree of knowledge into himself as the earth, he received Satan, who then grew in him
Although this is logical and reasonable, we need scriptural ground to confirm that something of Satan is in our body
It is better to translate it: 'For Sin shall not have the lordship over you,' or, 'for Sin shall not be lord over you'
Now you see that the fall of man was not just a matter of man committing something against God, but of man receiving Satan into his body
Sin was within the corrupted man, but there was no sin within the Lord Jesus; there was only the likeness of the flesh of sin
The mouse at first will think he has succeeded in getting the bait, but will not realize that he has been trapped until it is too late
Israel went into the Red Sea with Pharaoh and his army, but they were resurrected from the death-water without Pharaoh and his army
Christ brought man with Satan into death and the grave and brought man without Satan out of death and the grave
We have to say 'Hallelujah,' because the Lord Jesus is in our spirit; but we must also be on the alert, for we are still in the flesh
Though Satan by the fall got into man, he was dealt with by the Lord, and now by the resurrection the Lord is within us
The New Jerusalem is the Triune God mingled together with the resurrected man, and the Lake of Fire is Satan's ultimate destruction
All which is not related to the Triune God and the resurrected man will be put into the Lake of Fire with Satan
In conclusion, the meaning of this picture to us today is that the normal Christian life does not consist in doing good
The normal Christian life is simply taking Christ and living by Christ and putting the flesh with Satan to death all the time
The day will come when the Triune God and the resurrected man will be one expression-the New Jerusalem with the tree of life as its center
