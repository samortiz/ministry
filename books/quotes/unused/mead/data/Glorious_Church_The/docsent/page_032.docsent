   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"THE CHURCH...GLORIOUS"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is Christ's purpose in His cleansing and sanctifying work?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is that one day "He might present the church to Himself glorious" Eph 5:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is waiting for the church to be prepared and presented to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"The church...glorious" in the original language means that the church is brought into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, the church will put on glory or be clothed in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 4 says that the church will arrive at the oneness of the faith and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ v. 13 . Then chapter five says that the church will be clothed with glory to be presented to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God intends to bring the entire church to this state.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is indeed a great matter!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we look at the condition of the church today, we say, "How can it be?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may even doubt God's intention, but the Lord is working.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day the church will arrive at the oneness of the faith; she will arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; she will be clothed with glory and presented to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what the Lord desires and will obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is also what we desire and will obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This glorious church will not have spot or wrinkle or any such things, but she will be holy and without blemish 5:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord will cleanse us to such a degree that it will seem as if the church has never had any spot or defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It will seem as if the church has never committed sin; nor will any trace of sin be found in her.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only is it without spot, but it is also without any wrinkle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all know that children and young people have no wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever wrinkles appear on a person, it means that he is getting old.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord wants to bring the church to the stage where there is nothing old, where there is nothing of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wants everything in the church to be new.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the church stands before the Lord, it will seem as if she has never sinned, as if she has never had any history of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She will be without spot or wrinkle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the future she will be the church according to God's purpose at creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church will not only be without spot or wrinkle, but she will not have "any such things."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the translation from the Greek, it can be read, "This or that kind of defect."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She will not only be without spot and wrinkle, but she will not have any defect whatsoever; all the defects will have been excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The day is coming when God's work upon the church will be brought to such a stage that she will be completely glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, she will be "holy and without blemish."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the meaning in Greek, this can be read, "That it should be holy and blameless."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God will bring the church to the place where nothing can be said against her in any respect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The world will have nothing to say; Satan will have nothing to say; everyone and everything will have nothing to say; even God Himself will have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In that day, when the church is so glorious, she will become the Bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must see these two matters very clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, today we are Christ's own Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As His Body, Christ is purging and preparing us so that we may become the church which God intended from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, when the time arrives, Christ will come, and we will be brought into His presence to be presented to Him as a glorious church, His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, first we have the history of the Body of Christ on earth, and then in glory the history of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we are in the process of being cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now is the time that we need the rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christians who have never received direct revelation are delaying God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have never heard the Lord speaking to us, we are hindering the Lord from pouring forth His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May God be merciful to us that we may not be those who hinder Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, may we be those who hearken to Him and go forward so that the church may be brought to the stage of being the Bride of Christ.</S>
