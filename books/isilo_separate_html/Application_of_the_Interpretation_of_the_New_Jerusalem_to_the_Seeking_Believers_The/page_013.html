The Use of Fire and Water in Eternity</h2><p>This indicates that of the two destructive elements, water and fire, used by God to destroy all His opposers, one of them, that is, fire, will be used by God for this purpose for eternity, and the other, that is, water, will be prohibited from its destructive function by the guarantee of God&#8217;s unfailing faithfulness signified by the colors of the city&#8217;s foundations. Water in eternity will be used by God only as an element of life supply (22:1-2). Water will never again be used by God as a destructive element for His judgment. Instead, in the New Jerusalem the living water will be man&#8217;s divine beverage.<p>After this fellowship we can see that the New Jerusalem&#8217;s transformed and built up wall functions in four main ways. First, it sanctifies all the things belonging to God. God would not let any of His things be mixed up with the things which are not of Him, so there is the need of separation. The New Jerusalem&#8217;s wall functions to separate the New Jerusalem unto God as something holy. This is why it is called the holy city.<p>Second, the wall protects. In ancient times the cities had walls around them for protection. The wall of the holy city protects the interest of the riches of God&#8217;s divinity and the attainments of Christ&#8217;s consummation.<p>The third function of the wall is to express God. God&#8217;s appearance is like jasper and the light of the New Jerusalem is like jasper, so the whole city will express God. God the Father is the gold as the base; God the Son is the gates to bring people in; and God the Spirit transforms people to express God. The base of gold is something within, but the wall can be seen. This wall is in the color of the stone that signifies God, that is, jasper. Revelation 21:11 reveals that the city&#8217;s glory is like the glory of jasper. That is God&#8217;s appearance. Today, the function of the Body of Christ which consummates in the New Jerusalem is to express Christ.<p>The fourth function of the wall with its foundations is to guarantee God&#8217;s unfailing faithfulness for eternal security. The New Jerusalem standing upon the twelve layers of its foundations in the colors of the rainbow guarantees God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p>Now we need to consider how to apply this fellowship. In our created state we were dust, but God wants to transform us into something which is wonderful in His eyes. By His Spirit He transforms us through the renewing of our mind, emotion, and will, the components of our soul. We are souls. Exodus 1:5 says that seventy souls of Jacob&#8217;s family went down to Egypt. Acts 2:41 says, &#8220;There were added on that day about three thousand souls.&#8221; The soul is the natural man, the natural man is the fallen man, and the fallen man is the man abandoned by God. If we want to change our status, we need transformation. In order to be transformed, our mind, emotion, and will must be renewed.<p>Once a sister told me that our church needs a hospital. I responded by telling her that this was a natural thought from her natural mind. The mind has to be renewed. We need to cut off our unrenewed thoughts. The Body of Christ is not here for a school or a hospital. After we are saved, we still have many peculiar thoughts because of our unrenewed mind. Our mind should be broken and transformed by being renewed.<p>In order to experience the transformation of God by the Spirit, we have to apply all the Bible teachings to our mind. We have to let our mind be renewed so that it can eventually be occupied by the Spirit. Ephesians 4:23 says that we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. Through the spirit spreading into our mind, we are renewed for our transformation.<p>Also, our mind should continually be set upon the Spirit (Rom. 8:6), and the Spirit today is Jesus Christ. Our mind should be set on Him. Then our mind will be life and peace. If our mind remains in its oldness, always set upon the flesh, that is death. Our natural person, composed of the mind, emotion, and will, needs to be renewed. Day by day, we should live a life not according to our natural concept, but according to our renewed mind. Our mind is renewed by the word of God. Only the word of God can renew our mind.<p>Transformation is a lifelong matter. It cannot be consummated within a short time. I have been under this renewing work for over sixty-three years. While I was teaching others, my mind, emotion, and will were renewed. Now I have a subdued will. In the past my will was like a wild horse without a bridle. I did whatever I liked or decided to do. But through the Bible teachings, my mind, emotion, and will have been renewed. Our stubborn will must be subdued to be a renewed will, which is so willing to submit itself to the will of God.<p>To daily submit ourselves to God&#8217;s will according to our renewed will is to practice a daily transformation. A wife may say to her husband, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, I have decided this three years ago? Who are you to change my will?&#8221; But this sister should be asked, &#8220;Who are you to make such a will? Are you God? Are you the One on the throne? Are you the One who carries out His administration through the golden street?&#8221; We are not the One on the throne. We are all His subjects. We have to submit ourselves to Him. We must have a flexible and subdued will through the transformation of the Spirit. This is the fourth application of this New Jerusalem.<p>The fourth application is to have our entire old being renewed. Then we accept the sufferings which are assigned to us as our outer man is daily consumed. We need to be consumed more. The outer man is consumed but the inner man is renewed every day (2 Cor. 4:16). This is the application of the New Jerusalem in dealing with our old man, the outer man, our soul with our body. We need our outer man to be consumed that our inner man may be renewed day by day.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
