 <h2 class="head1">A PRACTICAL EXERCISE IN SELECTING HYMNS<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE MEETING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Selecting an Opening Hymn</h2>
<p>One time there were many attendants in a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, but the atmosphere of the meeting was plain and somewhat indifferent. Someone selected hymn #128 in the Chinese hymnal, &ldquo;I prostrate, Lord, before Thee, / Marvel at boundless grace,&rdquo; and a brother changed it to <em>Hymns,</em> #213, &ldquo;On that same night, Lord Jesus, / When all around Thee joined.&rdquo; This was a good change. First, this showed that the brother knew how to change hymns; second, it showed that he knew how to touch the atmosphere. After singing <em>Hymns,</em> #213, there were three to four prayers that failed to match this hymn. In fact, the prayers neither touched nor came up to the level of the atmosphere. We should not ignore the atmosphere in a meeting, paying attention merely to our feeling and praying formal, conventional prayers. As a rule, after singing <em>Hymns,</em> #213 a brother should offer a prayer based on the feeling of the hymn to bring the atmosphere of the meeting forward. In brief, this hymn says, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, at Your last supper on earth, all around You was a dark shadow, and the situation was so difficult, but You still established Your supper for us to remember You. Apparently, it is we who remember You; actually, it is You who remember us. How could we be saved on that long, long night if You had not chosen and called us? Even today we are here remembering You because of Your grace.&rdquo; In our prayer, we need to bring the saints&rsquo; feeling deeper into the Lord, in order for them to sense that we remember the Lord because He first remembered us. When we offer such a prayer, the feeling of the saints will be turned to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Introducing and Strengthening the Subject<br />
of the Lord&rsquo;s Table Meeting</h2>
<p>Let us consider how to introduce the subject of the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. <em>Hymns,</em> #87, which says, &ldquo;O Lord! When we the path retrace / Which Thou on earth has trod,&rdquo; is neither good nor bad. However, <em>Hymns,</em> #158 is very good. This hymn speaks of how the Lord sought and found us and how He gave Himself for us. It is a very fitting hymn to continue the feeling of the previous hymn. After singing <em>Hymns,</em> #213 it would be good if someone had prayed, &ldquo;O Lord, we thank and praise You. Before You departed from us, You established this table for us to remember You. We see that this bread is the body You gave for us, and this cup is the blood of the covenant, the blood You shed for us. We cannot but thank and worship You. Lord, You gave Your body and shed Your blood for us as the portion You have given us. Today we come especially to remember You and express our love for You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How should we select a second hymn? Someone may suggest <em>Hymns,</em> #437, &ldquo;Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him,&rdquo; but this is not suitable. We must firmly grasp this principle: we need to touch the feeling of the meeting. After singing <em>Hymns,</em> #213 and offering a prayer on how the Lord gave Himself and shed His blood for us, we could also continue with <em>Hymns,</em> #65, &ldquo;Jesus! that name we love.&rdquo; Stanza 2 is especially appropriate, saying, &ldquo;As Son of Man it was, / Jesus, the Lord! / Thou gav&rsquo;st Thy life for us, / Jesus, our Lord! / Great was indeed Thy love, / All other loves above, / Love Thou didst dearly prove, / Jesus, our Lord!&rdquo; This hymn continues the feeling of the earlier prayer and further strengthens the subject.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE MEETING<br />
BEING FOR THE REMEMBRANCE OF<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S PERSON, LIVING, SUFFERING,<br />
DEATH, EXALTATION, AND GLORIFICATION</h2>
<p>In order to remember the Lord in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, we need to see that it is the Lord&rsquo;s person and work that are worthy of our remembrance. First, we need to see the person of the Lord, to see who He is. We must see the two aspects of His person: He is God yet man; He is the Creator yet a creature. To remember the Lord is to come into the presence of the Lord and worship Him.</p>
<p>Second, we need to see the Lord&rsquo;s living on earth. This includes His humbling Himself, His humiliation, and His human virtues. Hence, at the Lord&rsquo;s table, we first need to see the Lord&rsquo;s person and then His human living. Regarding the Lord&rsquo;s human living, <em>Hymns,</em> #87 says that the Lord showed His faithfulness to God and His wondrous love and grace to men.</p>
<p>Third, we need to remember the Lord&rsquo;s suffering and death. There are many hymns on the Lord&rsquo;s death, such as <em>Hymns,</em> #101, #104, and #95. We may also say that this is to remember the Lord&rsquo;s work in redemption.</p>
<p>Fourth, we need to remember the Lord&rsquo;s exaltation, including His ascension and glorification. Our remembrance of the Lord consists basically around these four major points: His person, His living, His suffering and death, and His ascension and glorification. We remember the Lord for the things that transpired in the past, and we look forward to His coming back, which is something in the future. There are other items that are included in these major points; for example, the Lord&rsquo;s name is included in His exaltation, and His being the eternal Savior is included in His person. Furthermore, there are many small items, such as the Lord&rsquo;s humility, the Lord&rsquo;s washing His disciples&rsquo; feet, and the Lord&rsquo;s appearing to Mary. Nonetheless, there are four major points: first, the Lord&rsquo;s person; second, the Lord&rsquo;s human living, including all of His situations; third, the Lord&rsquo;s death; and fourth, the Lord&rsquo;s exaltation.</p>
<p>Which item should we remember when we gather around the Lord&rsquo;s table? Should we remember the Lord&rsquo;s person, His living, His death, or His exaltation? How can we discern? If we sing <em>Hymns,</em> #213, followed by <em>Hymns,</em> #158 to bring in a subject, we are remembering the third item of the Lord&#151;the Lord&rsquo;s death in His work. The Lord&rsquo;s death, however, did not begin with His crucifixion. His death began with His birth in the manger in Bethlehem. It would be very good to sing <em>Hymns,</em> #158 to remember the Lord&rsquo;s death in His redemptive work. If after singing <em>Hymns,</em> #158 the meeting is strong and does not need further strengthening, and the spirit is high and does not need further uplifting, what should we do? One of the brothers may add a prayer.</p>
<p>What should we do after a strong prayer has been offered and there is a need to maintain the spirit? We may bless the bread and the cup. Brothers and sisters, we must pay attention to this: when the spirit of the meeting is at its highest point, when the meeting has reached a climax, there is no need to choose a hymn or add a prayer for strengthening. Instead, there should be brothers who take the lead to bless the bread and the cup. There are no regulations in our meeting regarding how many hymns should be sung and how many prayers should be offered before we bless the bread and the cup. One time in a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, everyone sang over and over, they prayed, knelt down and stood up, and prayed and sang again for at least fifty minutes, but no one would bless the bread and the cup. This can be compared to country people who invite others to a meal at twelve noon but still have not served them by three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. We need to take care of the atmosphere and feeling of the meeting. I hope that the churches in different places will instruct the saints regarding these points.</p>
<p>We need to be watchful in spirit in the table meeting. We must bless the bread and the cup when the meeting reaches a climax and cannot go any higher. After we bless the bread and the cup and pass them around, there is a need to maintain the spirit with a hymn. We may use <em>Hymns,</em> #136, &ldquo;Gazing on the Lord in glory, / While our hearts in worship bow,&rdquo; or <em>Hymns,</em> #226, &ldquo;For the bread and for the wine, / For the pledge that seals Him mine.&rdquo; In contrast, <em>Hymns,</em> #226 bears a flavor of ritualistic formalities. We must touch the feeling of the meeting. In order to not allow the spirit to be weakened when we pass the bread and cup, we need to select a hymn that can maintain the spirit. At this point the selection of a hymn greatly depends on the prayers offered during the blessing of the bread and the cup. After singing <em>Hymns,</em> #158, someone may bless the bread and the cup, praying, &ldquo;O Lord, thank You for first remembering us. You shed Your blood and died for us in this wilderness. The bread and the cup show us the story of Your giving up Your life and shedding Your blood for us. The scene of Your crucifixion is before our eyes. You wore a crown of thorns, and Your head was full of bruises. Lord, we thank You.&rdquo; Someone else may continue and pray, &ldquo;Lord, the picture of Your coming down to the earth from heaven to shed Your blood and die for us is vividly before us.&rdquo; In such a case it would be good if someone selected <em>Hymns,</em> #95, &ldquo;O Head once full of bruises, / So full of pain and scorn.&rdquo; The hymn selected should be according to the prayer that blessed the bread and the cup.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #93, &ldquo;Lord, we treasure with affection / All Thy path of sorrow here,&rdquo; is also good. This hymn is better than <em>Hymns,</em> #95 in continuing <em>Hymns,</em> #158. The fourth stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #93 is the highest, speaking of sin&rsquo;s distance and how far-reaching it is: &ldquo;Thou didst measure then sin&rsquo;s distance, / Darkness, wrath and curse were Thine; / Man-betrayed, by God forsaken; / Thus we learn Thy love divine!&rdquo; The contents of this stanza show the far-reaching scope of sin. Even though the Lord went through all these sufferings, we do not know the far-reaching scope of sin. Nevertheless, the Lord experienced all these things personally, measuring out the distance of sin, enabling us to see the length of sin&rsquo;s distance: darkness, wrath, and the curse. It is not until we have such a realization that we can know the loveliness of the Lord. If we want to touch the feeling of a meeting, we must at least understand the meaning expressed through the words of the hymns.</p>
