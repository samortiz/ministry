   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE HEAVENLY VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD S SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning something higher and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the standard of the New Testament revelation, those who serve the Lord are persons who have seen the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is true of every person who is saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE LORD S SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>HAVING SEEN THE HEAVENLY VISION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The testimony that Paul gave to King Agrippa in Acts 26 shows the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul was a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of Judaism v. 5 , and being zealous for God, he did many things contrary to the name of Jesus by persecuting Christians, including Christians in foreign cities vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, as he was journeying to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests to capture those who call on the name of the Lord, a light from heaven shined around him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was the Lord s personal appearing to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In that appearing the Lord said He was sending Paul to the Gentiles, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith v. 18 . Then Paul said to King Agrippa that he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision v. 19 . From Paul s defense to King Agrippa, we see that his life was divided into two periods.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first period he was zealous for God according to his natural concept in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the second period he served the living and true God according to the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament we cannot find another person as zealous as Saul of Tarsus was for God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Philippians 3 Paul spoke of himself in this way, As to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless v. 6 . He gave his life for Judaism, being a zealot for the traditions of his forefathers Gal 1:14 . He was not an idle person, nor was he indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, one day he saw a heavenly vision that captured him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one preached the gospel to him; rather, the Lord Jesus appeared to him personally from heaven and preached the gospel to him Acts 26:14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In his youth Paul was educated in Greek culture; he was further trained at the feet of Gamaliel in the strictest sect of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He knew the law in the Old Testament as well as the traditions of his forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also knew how to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only so, he was a Hebrew born of Hebrews and a bona fide Pharisee Phil 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a proud and outstanding person did not consider fishermen, such as Peter and John, to be persons of importance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, no one was able to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This forced the Lord to appear to him in person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout two thousand years of church history, this might be the only instance when the Lord, having passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, appeared in person, from heaven, to a man and preached the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, when Paul later spoke of this incident, he referred to it as the heavenly vision Acts 26:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time a great light from heaven shined around Paul, and immediately he fell to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then a voice from heaven spoke to him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That speaking became a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul not only heard the gospel, but he also saw the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This caused him to fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The God of Glory Appearing to Us</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In principle, we also should have Paul s experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may be engaged with a certain matter and occupied by it, but at the appointed time the Lord will come to meet us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps, as we are pursuing an education and are about to obtain a degree, the Lord will come to meet us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Or perhaps when our business fails and we despair of living, we will meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our meeting with the Lord is our experience on the road to Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sooner or later we need to experience being met by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One of our co-workers met the Lord in a Buddhist temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before his salvation he opposed Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day as he passed by an old Buddhist temple, he saw a copy of the Bible on the table used for offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He picked up the Bible and read Psalm 1: Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners v. 1 . The more he read, the more he was touched.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then he wept, repented, and confessed his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He met the Lord there, and as a result, he believed into Him and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every serving one cannot deny the fact that he has met the Lord at one point on the journey of his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even after believing for many years, it is not uncommon to have some questions about the existence of God, because He can neither be seen nor touched.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may wonder where the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even I have doubted at times.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have been speaking to people about the Lord for sixty years, yet there are times when I ask myself these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seems that I know, but it also seems that I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One thing I know for sure is that as I was traveling in my human life, the Lord met me one day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I cannot deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every serving one has to see a vision at least once and allow that vision to direct his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It may seem that some were confused when they chose their spouses, and others may regret their choice of occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, eventually, when we take everything into account, we must admit that it is the Lord who has directed our lives.</S>
