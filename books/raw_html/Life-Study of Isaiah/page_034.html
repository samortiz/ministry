This Prophetic Warning Being Fulfilled<br>by the Babylonian Invasion and Captivity</H2><P>The foregoing prophetic warning was given in approximately 758 B.C., and it was fulfilled in approximately 606 B.C. by the Babylonian invasion and captivity (2 Kings 24&#151;25). The Babylonians devastated Jerusalem and carried away the important people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. This Warning Being Quoted<br>by the Lord Jesus and by John</H2><P>This warning was quoted by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13:14-15, while the Lord was on earth, to remind the rebellious and stubborn Jews under His ministry. This warning was also quoted by John in John 12:40. The Lord's reminding was fulfilled in A.D. 70 by the Roman army under Titus (Matt. 23:37-38; 24:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. This Warning Being Quoted by the Apostle Paul</H2><P>This warning was also quoted by the apostle Paul in Acts 28:25-27 to remind the unbelieving Jews under his preaching of the gospel; and his reminding was also fulfilled in A.D. 70 by Titus with his army. Furthermore, after A.D. 70, this warning has been fulfilled throughout the centuries.</P>
