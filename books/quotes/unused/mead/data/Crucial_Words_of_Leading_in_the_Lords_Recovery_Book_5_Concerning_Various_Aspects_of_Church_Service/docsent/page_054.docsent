   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BIBLE SPEAKING OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT AS WELL AS SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We believe in the Lord, and we also believe the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible not only speaks of salvation but also of reward and punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 9:16-17 Paul says, If I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since my youth I did not understand what these verses meant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why should we be in woe if we do not preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I preached the gospel because I loved the Lord, but why would I become woeful if I did not preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Gradually, I understood that the woe of not preaching the gospel is something negative.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It refers to our losing our reward and not having a part in the kingdom with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The positive aspect of our preaching the gospel is spoken of in Luke 16:9, which says, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fallen man is unrighteous, but it pleases God in His mercy to use us, the unrighteous people, to preach His gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, not only has God put unrighteous money into our hand; it also pleases Him to use that unrighteous money to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The people whom we save by preaching the gospel become our good friends.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are also our friends by means of the unrighteous mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would preach the gospel in this way, there will be many people welcoming us when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The people who welcome us are those who were saved through our investing of our energy and our money.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul says in 2 Corinthians 12:15, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul spent all that he had for the Corinthians, and he even spent his person, his self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Corinthians were Paul s children born in Christ; they were also the friends Paul made by means of his money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord returns, these will welcome Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will also be Paul s joy and crown.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be honest and ask ourselves, How many people will welcome us when the Lord returns?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not a joke.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible says, They may receive you into the eternal tabernacles Luke 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not take this matter lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE LORD JESUS DESIRING THE CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>TO COME TO HIM</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the heavenly host rises up to praise when one sinner is saved, we must regard the preaching of the gospel seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This also applies to the children, because the Lord wants the children to come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Matthew 19 some children were brought to see Jesus that He might lay His hands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the disciples rebuked them, the Lord Jesus said, Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens v. 14 . The Lord did not refuse the children from coming to Him; He also laid hands on them and blessed them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter 21 the Lord Jesus went into Jerusalem for the last time, and the city was filled with people welcoming Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The chief priests and the scribes knew the Bible, but they did not welcome the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the children were singing and rejoicing, crying out, Hosanna to the Son of David v. 15 . The children who cried out were very young, because in the next verse the Lord Jesus said, Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 2 Timothy 3:15 Paul says to Timothy, From a babe you have known the sacred writings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul says that Timothy knew the Bible since he was a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe that when Timothy s mother was feeding him, she must have been speaking the Bible to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The faith in Timothy came from his mother and his grandmother 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even the Old Testament says, Fear Jehovah your God and keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I am commanding you, you and your son and your grandson, all the days of your life; and that your days may be extended Deut 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God commanded the children of Israel to speak the law to their children v. 7a .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How many children are there in our church life?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A brother said that we have less children than what we had twenty years ago, because there are fewer children in each household.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, in some churches the number of children in the children s meeting is larger than the number of saints in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not depend only on the saints children; there are children everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can also gain the children of unbelieving families for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to lead children to the Lord, we must take care of the children s meeting; this includes the matter of teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the past most of the shepherds for the children s meetings were mainly the saints in high school and college, but there is now a great shortage of teachers for the children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to consider this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>EVERY SAINT AND EVERY HOME INVOLVED</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>IN THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>AND IN THE CHILDREN S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning preaching the gospel, the church in Taipei is not at a low ebb but on the rise; that is, the tide is rising on the matter of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not agree that we only pay attention to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should also pay attention to how many people we have brought to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, each of us must set aside some time to visit our relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is better for us to sacrifice a few meetings and use that time to visit people and lead them to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the person we visit does not believe today, we can visit him again next week and continue visiting him until he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then all the angels in heaven will rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should consider what will make the angels rejoice: our attending all the meetings or our leading some to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May we all receive this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church should be a church that saves sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the day of Pentecost the Lord added newly saved ones to His church, and all the saved ones announced the gospel of Jesus from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should have such an atmosphere among us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The older sisters can open their homes and preach the gospel to their neighbors who are available during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They can also invite children to their homes for a children s meeting in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The sisters can prepare some snacks for the children and tell them stories.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we would carry this out, the Lord will remember us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Concerning going to the countryside to spread the gospel, we must be clear that there is no organization among us; neither is there any centralized power, or even any organized move.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every saint among us must open to the Lord and receive His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need not wait for one another, nor do we need to move unanimously.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As long as there are two or three, they can proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Please pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We hope that the spirit of every saint will be kindled so that all the homes and all the saints are preaching the gospel in the community, to their colleagues, in the countryside, and to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must not take the children lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All the verses from the Bible that my mother read to me when I was a child have remained in me to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These verses are seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should speak the Lord s word, grace, salvation, and gospel to our offspring and to other children.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When other children are brought in, their parents will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May we all receive this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We look to the Lord to encourage all the saints to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>May the Lord kindle a fire in the ten thousand saints who meet regularly so that every saint will have the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The way of the gospel involves everyone preaching the gospel, every home preaching the gospel, the saints in all walks of life preaching the gospel to their colleagues, and the saints preaching the gospel in the countryside and among the children.</S>
