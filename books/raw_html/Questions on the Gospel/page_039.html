<h1 class=msg>QUESTION TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>CONCERNING CHRIST’S DEATH</h1><p>What is the difference between Christ dying for us (Rom. 5:8) and Christ dying for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3)?<h2 class=head1>ANSWER</h2><p>The meaning of Christ dying for us is that Christ died for us as sinners. The purpose of His death was to save us, the sinners. We were gained and delivered from ourselves as a result of Christ’s accomplishment for us.<p>The meaning of Christ dying for our sins is that Christ died for the sins which we, the sinners, have committed. The purpose of this was to remove the record of our sins and deliver us from the punishment and power of sin so that our sins could be forgiven and we could be freed from sin’s dominion.
