   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALVATION OF THE SOUL 1 Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting in Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>on July 4, 1930</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Issue No. 6</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The question we wish to bring up today is one to which many, as far as I know, have not paid attention.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the matter of the salvation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning salvation, we should emphasize very much that there is a great difference between the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "Your spirit and soul and body."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This word clearly divides man into three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Simply put, the spirit is the part of man which fellowships with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lower animals do not have this; therefore, lower animals cannot worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The soul is the organ of man's thought, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lower animals also have this part.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The soul is just the life we have as an animal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The body is the part of man which communicates with the material world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man is of three parts, spirit and soul and body; therefore, the meaning of salvation is that all three parts have to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 5:5 says, "His spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This speaks of the salvation of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 8:23 says, "The redemption of our body."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This speaks of the salvation of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we wish to examine the salvation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will look carefully into every place in the New Testament where the salvation of the soul is mentioned so that we may understand what the salvation of the soul is, and what its significance is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matthew 16:24-28 says, "Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Then Jesus said to his disciples."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From this word, we know that the Lord Jesus spoke the following words to his disciples, not to outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since they were the disciples, they were saved people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we should remember that the following words were spoken to saints who were already saved, not to sinners who were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"If anyone wants to come after Me."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Anyone" means anyone among the saved ones who will come after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Anyone" still refers to the saved disciples, those who particularly want to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The words "come after Me" indicate that the words which follow are the conditions of coming after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Let him deny himself."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To deny the self does not mean to conquer the self.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It does not mean to ignore oneself or renounce one's rights.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To deny the self means to not follow one's own mind in everything and not consider oneself the center.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It means putting oneself aside and seeking God's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord says that only this kind of person can come after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is very obvious because in order to follow the Lord, one surely cannot follow himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Take up his cross and follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is even deeper than denying oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To deny oneself is to forget about oneself, but to take up the cross is to submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To take up the cross is accepting all that God has arranged and being willing to suffer according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we deny the self and take up the cross, we will be able to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word "life" is psuche in the original text, which means "soul."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This verse speaks of the matter of saving one's soul and losing one's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This sheds light on the question we are about to examine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"For."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a continuation of what was said before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word "for" shows us that the denying of the self and the taking up of the cross to follow the Lord in the last verse is the same thing as saving and losing of the soul spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"For whoever wants to save his soul-life."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that though a person wants to follow the Lord, he is not willing to deny himself or take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From this, we can understand to some extent the meaning of saving one's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It means to be unable to disregard oneself or renounce one's rights; it means to be unable to allow oneself to suffer and submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This word shows us that saving the soul is opposite to denying the self and taking up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, if a man understands what it is to deny the self and take up the cross, he understands what it is to save the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord tells us that if a man cares for himself so much and is unwilling to deny himself, take up the cross, suffer, or submit to God, the ultimate end of saving his soul will be losing his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Losing the soul means to suffer ultimately, losing what one delights in and failing to receive what pleases him.</S>
