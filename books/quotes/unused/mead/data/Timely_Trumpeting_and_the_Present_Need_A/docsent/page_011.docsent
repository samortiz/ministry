   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Being Organic and Not Organizational</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The local churches should be organic; they should not be organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although these two words are simple, they are not easily explained.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our minds are, by natural constitution, bent on being organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After we are saved and begin to love the Lord, and even after we have become elders, within we are still full of organizational thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We always think in terms of control and organization.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Peter 5:1-3 says, Therefore, the elders among you I entreat, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory about to be revealed: shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God; not seeking gain by base means, but eagerly, nor as lording it over the allotments, but becoming patterns of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Shepherding is organic, while lording it over is organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the elders to shepherd is an organic matter, while for them to lord it over others is an organizational matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although after the last four years of labor, the church in Taipei has been put on the right track of the new way, I am still worried that the element of organization is stronger than the element of organism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, when a meeting hall decides to preach the gospel, it gathers a few dozen brothers and sisters together, divides them into teams of three, and sends them out by teams to knock on doors and visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This way is rather organizational and is a hindrance to the proper organic functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the new way of the Lord s recovery, there should not be this kind of organization; rather, every brother and sister should be led of the Lord and should be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every day they should live a revived and overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every day they should have a touch with the Lord and should fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way, the Holy Spirit will have the circulation of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A few of us will then spontaneously be burdened to go to visit people and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These few do not have to wait for the arrangement and organization of the elders; instead, they can just go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will be organic and not organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It will be the prompting and leading of the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only does the preaching of the gospel have to be organic, but even the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings have to be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These should not be carried out through organization.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should try our best to avoid any arrangement that resembles organization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why do we fall into organization?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason for this is that we are not perfected enough organically.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is like a mother raising her child.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Provided she gives the child enough nourishment and protects him from sickness, all of the child s activities, no matter what they are, will be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if one day the child has a stroke and his arms or legs become paralyzed, he will lose their organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When that happens he will need artificial arms or legs in order to perform the same functions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But then the functioning will no longer be organic; it will be organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the co-workers and elders among us have not rendered enough perfecting and nourishment to the saints, the saints have not attained to the proper measure of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>None of the saints are burdened enough for the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is not even the adequate burden for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because there is the lack of burden, everything is done by instruction, promotion, and arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is proof that there is very little organic functioning by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, what is manifested is mostly human labor and is very close to being an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today all of Christianity is greatly lacking in the life supply and life growth, and the result is that everything is maintained by organization.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although we have received mercy and light from the Lord to be a little different from them, in practice we are still very weak in the perfecting in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let me give another obvious example.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When there is the need to clean the meeting hall, the elders will announce the need, with the hope that the brothers and sisters will pick up the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Initially, when the announcement is made, many come to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But after a while, the zeal cools down, and as more friction comes in among the saints who serve, the number drops.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This proves that the whole work is organizational rather than organic.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The elders should help the brothers and sisters to pray more and to abide in a life of loving the Lord and having much fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way, the Holy Spirit will move in the saints, like blood circulating, to give them a feeling within that they should come to the meeting hall to clean.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What others are reluctant to do, they will gladly take up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When they come to serve in this way, their service will be organic and not organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First Peter 5:2 says, Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing...according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Shepherding the flock of God must not be according to methods, ordinances, or one s own will; rather, it should be according to God, according to His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is to be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not by way of compulsion, but willingly...not seeking gain by base means, but eagerly 1 Pet 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these are comparisons of the organic way with the organizational way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They show us that the elders shepherding should not be organizational, but organic.</S>
