<h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE LORD IN EXODUS</h2><p>In the book of Exodus there is a great deal of enjoyment. For example, the Passover was an enjoyment for the children of Israel. It was a feast that eventually was made an ordinance. Every year the first of the feasts was the feast of the Passover. The focus of this feast is the lamb, which typifies Christ as our Redeemer. This indicates that Christ is the initial enjoyment of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Even while the children of Israel were still in Egypt, they could have a good enjoyment of the Passover lamb. Not only did they apply the blood to the lintel of the door, but they ate the flesh of the lamb. Hence, that lamb was for their enjoyment.</p><p>After the children of Israel came into the wilderness, they began to enjoy the manna and the living water out of the cleft rock. The children of Israel, therefore, enjoyed at least three things&mdash;the Passover, the manna, and the living water. It is important for us to realize that they had all this enjoyment before the tabernacle and the priesthood were revealed. This means that even without the tabernacle and the priesthood, they could have the enjoyment of the lamb, the manna, and the living water.</p><p>If we are clear concerning the situation of the children of Israel, we shall be able to see where today&rsquo;s Christians stand. Where are most Christians: before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, or after? No doubt, the majority of Christians are before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood. This means that the situation of today&rsquo;s Christians is one without God&rsquo;s dwelling and without God&rsquo;s priesthood. At best, most Christians enjoy the Passover lamb, the manna, and the living water. However, the number of those who enjoy the living water is actually very few. When I was young, I heard much talk about the Passover lamb and also about the manna, but I did not hear nearly as much concerning the living water out of the cleft rock.</p><p>We need to ask ourselves where we are with respect to the enjoyment of Christ. Do we have only the enjoyment that comes before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, that is, the enjoyment of the Lamb, the manna, and the water? Where are you concerning the enjoyment of Christ? Are you before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, or after? This question is extremely important. If in your enjoyment of Christ you are before the tabernacle and the priesthood, then you cannot have any share in the compound ointment. This ointment can be enjoyed only after God&rsquo;s dwelling place and the body of serving ones have come into existence. It is not for God&rsquo;s chosen people to enjoy apart from God&rsquo;s dwelling and His priesthood.</p><p>When asked whether your enjoyment of Christ is before or after the tabernacle and the priesthood, you may find it difficult to answer. You may hesitate, not knowing whether to say yes or no. However, I have the assurance that the vast majority of us have had at least some experience of the compound ointment. What we have enjoyed in our experience is not only the oil but the ointment.</p><p>Whereas the oil is simple, containing just one element, the ointment is rich. As we have pointed out again and again, it is a compound produced by blending four spices with olive oil. It is extremely significant that in Exodus 30 we have a record of the divine revelation concerning this compound ointment. The elements and the quantity of these spices are also significant. Although there are four kinds of spices, there are actually only three complete units of five-hundred shekels each.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF<br />THE NUMBERS THREE AND FIVE</h2><p>In the record concerning the compound ointment, we have the numbers three and five. In the Bible, when the numbers three and five are put together, this combination is related to God&rsquo;s building. God&rsquo;s first building was the ark of Noah. In the description of the ark there are multiples of the numbers three and five: &ldquo;The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits&rdquo; (Gen. 6:15). Furthermore, the ark was to be made &ldquo;with lower, second, and third stories&rdquo; (Gen. 6:16). God&rsquo;s second building was the tabernacle. The tabernacle was of three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. With the tabernacle, the number five occurs frequently. For example, the tabernacle was made with ten curtains of fine linen. According to Exodus 26:3, five curtains were joined to one another, and the other five curtains were also to be joined to one another. Furthermore, the curtains in the outer court were squares each measuring five cubits by five cubits. Also, the altar of burnt offering was five cubits in length and width, and three cubits in height. Therefore, with God&rsquo;s second building we have the numbers three and five.</p><p>In the Bible the number three signifies the Triune God in resurrection. Resurrection, as we know, was on the third day. Therefore, the Triune God and resurrection are both signified by the number three. As we have mentioned several times, in the Bible the number five, formed of four plus one, signifies responsibility. Therefore, the numbers three and five together signify the Triune God in resurrection bearing responsibility for His people. This is for the building.</p>
