   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. A Separation between the Spiritual Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Worldly Ones</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church witnessed a drastic change in the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During that period, many who joined the church were either unbelievers or half believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They appeared to be believers, yet they held worldly power in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They had no desire to serve the Lord in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the most they were saved, but they could not serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Spontaneously, some spiritual ones rose up to take care of the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The others then said, You do it!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Go and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are the secular ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word secular was introduced in the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some would attend to earthly affairs, while others would attend to spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result many served God, but many more no longer served.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the time of the apostles in the first century, every believer served the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the fourth century on, men began to say, We are merely God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We attend to our own affairs in the world and keep our positions in society.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once in a while, we give a little money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This should qualify us as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let the spiritual ones take care of the spiritual things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From that time forward, the church followed the footsteps of the nation of Israel; it worshipped the golden calf and created an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No longer were all of God s people priests.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some became merely His people but not His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, clergymen in the Roman Catholic Church are called priests.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In China they are known as fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These so-called fathers are actually called priests.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some state churches follow the example of the Roman Catholic Church and give their pastors the title of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who tend to earthly affairs are called God s people, while those who manage spiritual things are called priests.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church has been divided into priests and people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>D. The Lord Taking the Way of Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is something I would like all of us to see: In this end time, God is doing a work of recovery; He is taking the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe God is leading all of His children up to this position in this last age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here is one segment of the pathway of the church that is waiting for a fundamental recovery the universal priesthood of God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as a person is one of God s people, he should be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are priests today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the kingdom to come, there also will be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God wants to secure His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He wants all of His people to be His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE SERVICE OF THE PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As soon as you become a Christian, you become a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you want to be a Christian, you have to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not expect anyone to be a priest for you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to be a priest yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no intermediary class among us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one will attend to spiritual affairs for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one will work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Among us we must not have another class of people called workers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A. The Need for the Whole Church to Serve</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If God is merciful to us, all the brothers and sisters will spontaneously be working, preaching the gospel, and serving the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more universal the priesthood is, the more visible the church will be.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once the priesthood becomes non-universal, we have failed and our pathway has been corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>B. God Honoring Us by Allowing Us to Serve Him</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are poor, weak, blind, and crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the Lord to accept persons such as ourselves to be priests is an honor to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Old Testament, such people could not be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All who were disabled, lame, or blemished could not be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, today the base, the unclean, the blind, and the disabled have all been called by God to be priests!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have said this before: We should gladly give ourselves to His service even if it means crawling to His feet to beg for service.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should be happy to kneel down to beg for this honor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am happy to crawl on my knees and plead with the Lord, Lord, I want to serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I gladly offer myself to Your service.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You honor me by allowing me to come to You.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To be a priest is to draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To be a priest is to have no distance between us and God; it is to be able to enter in directly and to wait for no one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be a priest means that we can touch God ourselves.</S>
