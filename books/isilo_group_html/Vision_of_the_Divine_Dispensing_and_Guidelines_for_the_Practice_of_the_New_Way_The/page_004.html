This Word is none other than God Himself. He is the explanation, the expression, and the manifestation of the mysterious God. One day, this God who is the Word became flesh (John 1:14a). He entered into a virgin's womb and was conceived there. After being there for nine months according to God's law in creation, He was born as a complete man. He is the One referred to in Isaiah 9:6, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father." This child who was born is the mighty God. He is the Son, and He is also the everlasting Father. Outwardly speaking, He is a man, but inside He is God. For this reason, man calls His name Emmanuel, which means God with us (Matt. 1:23). He is God, and He is man. He is a wonderful God-man.</P><P>When this eternal God became a man through becoming flesh, He brought with Him fullness of grace and reality (John 1:14). This grace is the gift that God gave to us, which we are not worthy to receive. But it is not a matter of some outward things, which are at most material blessings. Rather, it is God Himself as our enjoyment. And the reality is simply God Himself gained by us. When God is enjoyed by us, it is grace, and when God is gained by us, it is reality. This God who is full of grace and reality is not only enjoyed by us, but is also gained by us. Without Him, there is no gain. Take Him away, and there is vanity. Hence, God desires to dispense Himself to us to be our grace and reality. This grace and reality is the very divine fullness of the Triune God spoken of in John 1:16, of which we have received, grace upon grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Triune God Dispensing<br>to Those Believing into Him<br>the Son as the Eternal Life</H2><P>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life." This eternal life is nothing other than God's beloved Son. When we believe into Him, God dispenses this Son into us, so that we receive Him as eternal life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Son Dying to Release the Divine Life<br>and to Dispense It to All the Members of His Body</H2><P>For the accomplishment of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the Son went through a further step of crucifixion on the cross. He voluntarily offered Himself to accomplish an all-inclusive death, not only to deal with sin, the old man, Satan, the world, the old creation, and all the negative things, but to release the divine life, as the one grain of wheat falling into the ground, and to dispense it into all the members of His Body (John 12:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Son Resurrecting to Become the Spirit,<br>as the Ultimate Consummation of the Triune God,<br>Dispensing the Triune God into the Believers</H2><P>Three days after the Son died, He resurrected. In His resurrection, He was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit. The same evening, Jesus came into the midst of the disciples and appeared to them. He greeted them and breathed a breath into them. In this way, they received the Holy Spirit (John 20:8-9, 19, 22). This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God attained through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, by which the Triune God is dispensed into the believers.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision of the Divine Dispensing and Guidelines for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
