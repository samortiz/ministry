   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIGHT FROM THE LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The light in the Holy Place was a particular light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was not a natural light, that is, a light that comes from the sun during the day or from the moon and the stars at night.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neither was the light in the Holy Place a man-made light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Neither a natural light or a man-made light, it was a light that came from the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, it is a light that comes from the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the messages on the golden lampstand we pointed out that the lampstand is made purely of beaten gold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No substance or material other than gold is used.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The light comes out of the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that the light in the Holy Place comes purely out of the divine nature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With the gold we have the nature of the Father, the divine nature; with the form, the shape, of the lampstand, we have the Son; and with the lamps of the lampstand, we have the expression of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God, and the light in the Holy Place issues from the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With this golden lampstand, there is no mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With the exception of the wick, everything is golden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The light of the lampstand comes from the burning of the wick.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In ancient times the wick was made of materials from plants.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The wick signifies Christ s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes, Christ is divine, golden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But it is His humanity, signified by the wick, that burns with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the wick had not been saturated with oil, it would give off smoke instead of light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason 27:20 speaks of bringing olive oil, pure, beaten, for the light, to light the lamps continually.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>OLIVE OIL</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to dwell on this matter of the olive oil used in lighting the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ, as signified by the lampstand all of gold, is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in the center of the lamps there were the wicks.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These wicks were not of gold; on the contrary, they were of the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because gold does not burn, it cannot give light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the wicks that burn to give light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, in themselves it is very difficult for the wicks to give off light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead of giving off light, they give off smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the reason it is necessary to saturate the wicks with oil in order to have light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In typology oil signifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Oil comes from olive trees, and the olive tree signifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the sight of God, Christ is the real olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Chapter nine of Judges speaks positively of three kinds of trees: the olive tree, the fig tree, and the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Judges 9:9, the fatness of the olive tree is used to honor God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to verse 11, the fig tree is known for its sweetness and good fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This fruit is for man s nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 13 says that the vine produces wine which cheers God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All three of these trees typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is the olive tree, Christ is the fig tree, and Christ is the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 15 the Lord Jesus clearly said, I am the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this message we are concerned with Christ as the olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have seen that the lampstand is Christ as the embodiment of God, that within the lamps are the wicks, and that the wicks signify Christ s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The wicks burn with oil, and the oil signifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What we have today is not only the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit of God has become the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just as olives pass through a process to produce olive oil, so the Spirit of Christ has passed through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For us today, the oil with which the wicks burn signifies the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Putting all these matters together, we have the gold to make the lampstand signifying Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God; we have the wick, Christ s humanity burning with oil; and we have the oil signifying the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the olive tree, Christ grew on earth and then passed through a process that included incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When all these matters are put together, we have the coming forth of the light.</S>
