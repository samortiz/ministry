   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Genesis 2 the material was just lying there, but at the end of the Bible the gold, pearls, and precious stones are built into a city.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the beginning there was a garden created by God, but at the end the garden becomes a city.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The city is something created by God which has been transformed and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Jerusalem is a building with gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The beginning and end of the Bible reflect each other.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Jerusalem as a city has twelve gates, and at the end of the book of Ezekiel, there is also a city by the name of Jerusalem with twelve gates 48:31-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows us that on the one hand, the New Jerusalem is new; on the other hand, it is ancient.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The entire Bible is a revelation and a record of God's economy, and God's economy is consummated in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The New Jerusalem was something in God's heart in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This city is God's desire, God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that God saw the New Jerusalem in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When He looked at that, He was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was in Chefoo over fifty years ago, I had a dream of building a large meeting hall for the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This dream could be considered as my economy, my heart's desire, my good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But eventually China was taken over by the communists, and I did not see the completion of my dream to have such a hall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then I was sent from mainland China to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Taiwan we were not able to have a big meeting hall according to the one I envisioned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I began to minister in the United States in 1962, and we eventually moved to Anaheim in 1974.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Anaheim we were able to acquire two and a half acres of land to build a meeting hall according to my dream in Chefoo many years earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today's hall in Anaheim had been in my thoughts many years before it was built.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God also had a dream, and that dream was to have the New Jerusalem, a built up city, as the consummation of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning of the Bible, we see the tree of life, a flowing river, and precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the end of the Bible, we also see the tree of life, a flowing river, and precious materials built into a city according to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By this we can see how consistent the Bible is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was written by more than forty writers within a period of about fifteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Apparently Genesis is much different from Matthew, and Matthew is much different from Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It may seem that the sixty-six books of the Bible are independently different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the very intrinsic essence of the Bible is consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is consistent in one thing the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Jerusalem comprises the Triune God and His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Triune God has gone through a wonderful process.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In eternity past He was God, having only divinity, but one day according to His economy, He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is because His economy, His blueprint, shows that He wants to be one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He took the step to be incarnated four thousand years after Adam was created.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From Adam to Abraham was two thousand years, and from Abraham to Christ was two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The very Triune God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He did not become a man magically.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His incarnation was altogether according to the principle He had ordained in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For a man to be brought into existence, he must be conceived and remain in the womb for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then he is born and grows into manhood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the way Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was conceived in the womb of a virgin, and He was born out of her womb.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then He passed through boyhood and entered into manhood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What a wonder that the almighty, infinite, eternal Triune God would enter into the womb of the virgin Mary to be born of her and to be a typical man to live, walk, and work on earth for thirty-three and a half years!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The very almighty God who created the heavens and the earth with millions of items became a man and lived on this earth as a little man for thirty-three and a half years to be persecuted, to be despised, to be rejected, to be hated, and to be abhorred by His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that He has gone through a process, and through His process He has been consummated to be the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a God is included in the New Jerusalem, and we are there mingled with Him as one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Jerusalem is a great sign because the book of Revelation is a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Revelation 1:1 says that the revelation of this book is made known by signs, symbols with spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The seven lampstands are signs, signifying the seven churches 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lamb signifies Christ as the redeeming God 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus is not a literal lamb with a tail and four legs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lamb is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the same way, the entire New Jerusalem is a sign, signifying the ultimate consummation of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need signs because a picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is very difficult to describe what a person looks like, so the best way is to have a photo of that person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The New Jerusalem in the Bible is a "photo" of all the secrets, all the mysteries, of God's economy.</S>
