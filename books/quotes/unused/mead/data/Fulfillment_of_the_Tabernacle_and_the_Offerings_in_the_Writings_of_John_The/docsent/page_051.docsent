   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having the Bride as His Universal Increase</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The unlimited Christ has the bride as His universal increase.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This universal increase, Christ's bride, is the aggregate of all those who have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a living composition of all regenerated human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the bride as the universal increase of the unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can we become parts of the bride as Christ's universal increase?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is possible only as we receive the rhema of God so that we may be filled with the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we receive the word and are filled with the Spirit, we shall enjoy eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The result is that we become the bride, the universal increase of the unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT The All-inclusive Compound Spirit Typified by the Compound Ointment</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us now consider the immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word "immeasurable" not only denotes the sphere of the Spirit, but also denotes the contents and nature of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The immeasurable Spirit is immeasurable in sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is immeasurable also in contents and in nature, that is, in what the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The immeasurable Spirit is actually the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the details concerning this see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157 to 166.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The immeasurable Spirit as the all-inclusive compound Spirit is not simply the Spirit of power or the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This immeasurable Spirit is actually the consummate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The immeasurable Spirit is beyond our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is beyond our ability to speak concerning this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We simply do not have the utterance adequate to describe this immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that culture gives rise to words and terms in language.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not yet have the spiritual culture necessary to have the language adequate to describe fully the immeasurable, all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The immeasurable Spirit is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is ready to be received by those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way we become one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today some oppose the truth that Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They say that as Adam became a living soul through creation, so Christ became a living Spirit through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, they deny that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is the Holy Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, they admit that the Holy Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is an improvement over the concept that the Holy Spirit is simply an instrument or power and not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But Paul says that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became not only a spirit, but a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This does not denote merely the spirit of Christ as a being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ, of course, does have a spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Gospel of Mark we are told that when Christ was on earth, He perceived matters in His spirit Mark 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, when He was dying on the cross, He committed His spirit to God the Father Luke 23:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We also know from the book of 1 Peter that after Christ was crucified and before He was resurrected, He went in spirit to Tartarus to proclaim God's victory 1 Pet 3:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before He was resurrected and while His body was still in the tomb, Christ's spirit went to Tartarus to make such a declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1 Corinthians 15:45b Paul says that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit here is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The spirit of Christ, which after His death and before His resurrection went to Tartarus, could not give life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the Spirit who Christ became is the life-giving Spirit, identical to the Holy Spirit who gives life 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
