   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Seeking Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Individualism cannot exist if one seeks fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With individualism one always tries to maintain his individual spiritual life before God, his individual visions before God, and his individual work before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is always an individual; it is not easy for him to seek fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the problem among us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a person does not seek fellowship, but struggles and labors by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many children of God today can say only in words that they cannot do without other brothers or that they must have the church in order to live.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, many can live without the church and without fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This proves that they are individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a person receives the principle of fellowship and the principle of the Body only in concept, yet in actuality lives and works by himself, has a spiritual life without fellowship, and does the work of the Lord without fellowship, then this person has never been broken before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is altogether an individualistic person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fellowship is versus individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not what you say about fellowship; rather, it is a matter of whether fellowship is a part of your life, whether you really cannot live or work without fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day God will bring you to this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I feel that this is the greatest step.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not Merely a Matter</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>of Lacking Faithfulness and Faith</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When many people come to an impasse, they only consider that there are problems with their faith or faithfulness; they do not consider that there is a problem with their fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The education which many people have received in the past and the books which many have read instruct people to be faithful, to believe, and to submit directly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, a problem occurs when they are unable to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they cannot get through in their personal lives, they always consider that they themselves have a problem, that their faith has a problem, or that they are lacking in faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is right, but many only see that their failures and difficulties are due to problems in their personal faith, their personal faithfulness, or their personal submission.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They do not see that there is something else in the Bible called fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there are problems with fellowship, they can also arrive at the same point of failure and difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people s problems have nothing to do with the matter of faith or believing in God, but the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes the Lord must allow this kind of person to struggle in his faith, faithfulness, and submission so that he reaches a point in his Christian life where he simply cannot believe or submit no matter how hard he tries.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps he will then realize that he cannot make it simply as one member, nor can he make it merely by his union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He must be joined with the Body of Christ in order to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps he will then begin to see that he needs the help of other Christians in order to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many have not yet been brought on this way; they are still walking on the way of individualism, laboring by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is God s great mercy to bring a person to a point where he cannot get through, and where his eyes are opened to see that while submission, faith, and faithfulness do not suffice, fellowship does suffice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a great revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day God s children will be brought to a stage where all their ways are exhausted, and where they see that even such a great item as faith does not avail.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Faith is not a small matter, and we should not despise it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Faith, faithfulness, and submission are all great matters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, one day you will reach a point that even when all these conditions are fulfilled, you still cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Faith, faithfulness, and submission to God are all weighty matters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But even with these weighty things, you still have no way to get through until your eyes are opened one day and you begin to realize that fellowship is also a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without fellowship, you cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only a person who has passed through this pathway before God can escape individualism, not doing things individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who only know the doctrine of fellowship or the doctrine of the Body of Christ can still be individualistic for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They can believe in the doctrine of fellowship in a very individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God needs to bring them on a path where everything is exhausted, where the way is impassable, and where their problems still cannot be solved even though they continue to believe, be faithful, and submit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When God gives them a little light one day, they will see that their problem was actually in the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then their individualism will depart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter Seeking Fellowship under Authority</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Peter went to Caesarea by himself, he did not go individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He had fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Peter went from Joppa to Caesarea, he took the brothers from Joppa with him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was always under authority and always seeking fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, as soon as he returned to Jerusalem, he told the brothers what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although the job had been done, he still sought fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Philip Being Met by the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When Philip went to Samaria, he was one who submitted himself under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Otherwise, the Holy Spirit would not have called him to the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All those whom the Holy Spirit has met are those who are still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything in the church is arranged and regulated by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Head of the church is Christ, but the operation of the Head is through His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Holy Spirit brought Philip to the wilderness, he was still under authority.</S>
