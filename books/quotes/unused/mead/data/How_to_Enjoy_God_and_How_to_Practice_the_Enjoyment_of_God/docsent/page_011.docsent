   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE GOD S ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR MAN Scripture Reading: Psa 27:4; 43:4; 1 John 2:27-28 GOD S DESIRE BEING TO MINGLE HIMSELF WITH MAN FOR MAN S ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible unveils that throughout the ages God has been doing one thing in man: He has been mingling Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The human concept is that God wants man to worship and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is seen as the sovereign One far away in the heavens, and men on earth are expected to worship and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is man s concept.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible, however, shows that God does not require such things from us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, God wants to mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He wants to work His entire being into us to the extent that He becomes our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He wants to enter into us to be our content.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He wants to be our life and our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wants to be the love in our emotion, the thoughts in our mind, and the decisions and deliberations in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He even wants to be our ability and discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In brief, God wants to enter into us to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should simply be a vessel in the hands of God for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This divine intention is seen in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus is unique among the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Outwardly, He was a man, a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In every aspect He was a complete man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God was inside this man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Inwardly, He was filled with God, and God was expressed through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He was on earth, those who followed Him often asked, Who is this man?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was hungry, and He was thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was tired and even exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was confined to a body the same as we.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we look deeper, we will find that within this man there was unfathomable wisdom, unlimited power, immeasurable life, and eternal discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hardly anyone could answer this question when He was on earth, but we know who He is today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is God entering into man, becoming man s life and nature and being expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus manifests God s eternal intention for man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, we must realize that unless God is mingled with us in our worship and service, they are not worth anything before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The real worship rendered to God is one in which God is mingled with the worshipper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This also applies to service.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Real service to God is one in which the serving one is mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are going to preach the gospel, we need to remember that the Lord, who is mingled with us, should be the one preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the only preaching that counts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are praying, the Lord must be the one who is praying through us, that is, praying by mingling Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only such prayers are real prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are on earth, praying to a God who is far away in heaven, and we have nothing in common with Him, our prayers are not real but are merely a religious petition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the genuine prayer that God desires, He enters into us, mingles with us, and prays through us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every genuine prayer is a dual prayer; outwardly we are praying, but inwardly God is praying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Outwardly we petition, but inwardly He is petitioning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Outwardly we are speaking, but inwardly the Holy Spirit is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only this kind of dual prayer is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This applies to prayer as well as to preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If only I am speaking and the Lord is not, my preaching is worthless; it is merely human oration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The real preaching and release of the Lord s message is one in which the Lord in His humanity speaks through us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Outwardly we are speaking, but it is the Lord speaking from within.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Outwardly it seems as if we are the source of the speaking, but the Lord is the source of the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This speaking is a dual speaking, and only this kind of speaking has value.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This principle applies not only to our praying and preaching but also to the entire realm of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When it is said that a man has a dual character, it often is spoken in a derogatory way; nevertheless, this is a very fitting description of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The real Christian life should be a dual life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are living as an individual person, we are not living like a Christian; we are merely living like a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As genuine Christians, it seems as if we are the ones living, but inwardly God is living through us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every Christian should be like Jesus of Nazareth; we should be God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Outwardly we are men, but inwardly we are God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The entire Christian life should be one in which God is mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s children need to see this basic issue: God does not desire worship or service from man; neither does He desire to do things for man or man to do things for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He only desires that every part of our being would be filled with His element by His mingling of Himself with us and becoming the constituent of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we are filled with God s element, we will enjoy Him and know Him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only when we allow Him to fill us and become every part of our being can we truly know Him as He desires to be known.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This knowledge is not in doctrine, mental understanding, or intellectual apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can know Him deep in our being as the One whom we taste in our living and practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is to enjoy God.</S>
