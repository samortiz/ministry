   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FULL SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this book there are many seekings, many findings, and many satisfactions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At least four or five times the seeking one begins again to seek for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She finds what she is seeking, and she is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Each satisfaction enlarges her and creates further seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She becomes the palanquin and the crown, and in a sense is fully satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose you were to reach such a stage as to become the palanquin and crown to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am sure that you would shout, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the fullest satisfaction!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But there is still something further and better.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must go on from the crown to grow something for Him as a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the Lord will find something in us for His enjoyment and His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not only a matter of being a boast to Him as a crown; we must grow something for the Lord Jesus to eat and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, we must produce some materials for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are God's farm, and we are God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are the garden, and we are the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The building of the city comes out of the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ARMY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the seeking one becomes the city, she is also an army.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We mentioned that the tenth figure is the last one, but there is also the eleventh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the army.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why do I say that the tenth is the last, yet there is still the eleventh?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is because the tenth is the eleventh, and the eleventh is the tenth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we become a city to the Lord, we are an army to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not just an armory as in the past 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>An armory is defensive, but the army is offensive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not just a matter of defending the kingdom, but also of fighting for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She is so beautiful to the Lord, even as beautiful as Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But to the enemy, she is as terrible as an army with banners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all know that an army with banners means victory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She is not without banners.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that she has won the victory already.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No wonder she is so terrible to the enemy!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BUILDING AND WARFARE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, there was the armory for the defensive warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But now, the seeking one has become an army marching in triumphant victory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Hebrew word "army" in this verse is in the plural, so some of the better versions say that she is the hosts, the troops.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not just one troop, but the many troops with the banners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She has become such a marvelous fighting army as troops with the victory banners.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can never separate the building from the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wherever the building is, there is the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all remember the account in Nehemiah: with one hand the people did the building work, and with the other hand they held the weapons for battle Neh 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While they were building, they were fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Fighting always accompanies the building, and the building always brings in the victory in the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the consummation of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the uttermost completion that the seeking one of the Lord can attain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She is now a city as an army.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Ezekiel 37:2-10, we read the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the dry bones, after being inbreathed with life, came alive to be built into the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And at the same time they were formed into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The building is always an army.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without an enemy, there is no need to build a city.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In human history, the city came into existence because of the attacks of the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The city is God's dwelling place, but it is also the fighting army to the enemy.</S>
