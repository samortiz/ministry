   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE CITY, ONE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I want to give you all, especially the young people, a clear map for your driving in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have been driving on this road for more than forty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I can even tell you the way in my sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For our map, we shall use certain cities mentioned in the New Testament: Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, and Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we all know, the church began in Jerusalem, and it was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were not twelve churches in Jerusalem, one named after each of the twelve Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No, there was just one church that included everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 8:1 proves that the church in Jerusalem was uniquely one, for this verse speaks of "the church which was at Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There were not many churches at Jerusalem, but one church, the church, at Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The testimony of the church eventually spread north to Antioch through some saints who moved there from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later Barnabas went there to edify them and brought Paul with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As in Jerusalem, there was just one church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 13:1 says, "Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From Antioch the church spread to Asia Minor, where there were several churches in various cities.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Ephesus, for example, there was just one church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know that in Ephesus there was not more than one church because Revelation 2:1 speaks of the church, not churches, in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through the ministry of Paul, the church spread from Asia Minor to Europe, and a church was established at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Corinthians 1:2 says, "Unto the church of God which is at Corinth."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again we see the matter of one church in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Bible, there was one church in Jerusalem, one in Antioch, one in Ephesus, and one in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>DIVISIONS, SECTS, AND DENOMINATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the time came when the saints in the city of Corinth were divided into four groups.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One group said that they were of Cephas; another, of Paul; another, of Apollos; and another, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These four groups were four divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you read 1 Corinthians carefully, you will see that the Apostle Paul even called them sects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Corinthians 11:19 says that there were sects among them Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>. We need to understand what a sect is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose fifty Christians were meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Due to the various choices, tastes, and preferences, they were divided, like the Corinthians, into four groups.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One group was especially fond of Peter because he was the leading one of the twelve Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another group preferred Apollos because he was a scholar in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This group acknowledged that Peter was the leading apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But, they said, he was an uneducated fisherman, whereas Apollos was a scholar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those in this group enjoyed Apollos's expounding of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The third group liked Paul better than Apollos because he had a direct contact with the Lord on the way to Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fourth group said that they were of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although these fifty Christians were divided into four groups, they continued to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At first, their choices, tastes, and preferences simply made them four groups.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But later these groups became divisions and after that, sects.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, they were not yet denominated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They were sects, but not denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Notice the development here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It goes from preferences to divisions to sects.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sects are like political parties.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the sects give themselves a name, they denominate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way, the sects become denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose the sect of Peter chose the name the church of Peter or the Petrine church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they did this, they would immediately become a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The same would be true of the sects of Paul, Apollos, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, they would no longer be sects without a name, but denominations with a name.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, the development is firstly divisions, then sects, and finally denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the four groups at Corinth had become denominations, they would have been exactly the same as the denominations which abound in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christianity is filled not only with divisions and sects, but also with denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We all need a clear understanding of divisions, sects, and denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 1 Corinthians 11:18 and 19 Paul says, "For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For there must be also sects among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>. The King James Version has the word "heresies" instead of "sects."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Heresy" is an anglicized form of a Greek word which means schools of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, in Greek, heresies means schools of opinion which form parties.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A party, of course, is a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we first have divisions and then sects.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At the time of 1 Corinthians, however, there were no denominations.</S>
