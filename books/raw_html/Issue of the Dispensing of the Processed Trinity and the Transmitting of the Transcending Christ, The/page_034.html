<P>For this message I would like us to read Ephesians 1:15-23: "Therefore I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and your love to all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRAYING FOR A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION<br>THAT THE EYES OF OUR HEART MAY BE ENLIGHTENED</H2><P>Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. I want to stress this one point. The book of Ephesians has really become a treasure to many Bible students and teachers, yet very few have seen the intrinsic contents of this prayer in Ephesians 1. The Lord Jesus prayed a great prayer in John 17 concerning His Body in His oneness. The prayer by the apostle Paul in Ephesians 1 should be counted as second to the Lord's prayer in John 17. These are two great prayers. A number of believers may have seen something of the oneness prayed for by the Lord Jesus in John 17,  yet not many have seen something in this prayer by the great apostle, Paul.</P><P>Paul's prayer is centered on a spirit, our spirit, to be a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Wisdom is for us to have the way to understand, and revelation is the very view for us to see. On the one hand, we need the wisdom to understand, yet we still need the view to see. If we do not see anything, there is nothing for us to understand. First, we have to see the divine view. Through the fellowship in this book, we have seen a view; a view has been opened up. The curtain has been taken away.</P><P>We have a clear sky, a clear view, in front of us, yet we also need the wisdom to understand. Nearly all of Ephesians 1 is one sentence in Greek. Chapter two begins with the word and. This indicates that the long sentence in chapter one is not finished yet. What Paul said is really hard for us to understand (2 Pet. 3:15-16), so we need the wisdom. This is why I put out the concluding notes at the end of each of the previous four chapters. We should spend some time to get into these notes.</P><P>We need to pray, "O Lord, give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation." We have a spirit, but we need a kind of anointing from God to make our spirit a gift from Him. We all have a spirit, but our spirit is not so keen. Instead, it is dull. Thus, we need something from the very inspiring, enlightening God to make our spirit a new gift to us, full of revelation to see God's economy and full of wisdom for us to understand His economy. We need to see and understand God's economy, which is carried out by His divine threefold dispensing to result in the many sons, in the heritage as a treasure to God, and in the glorification of the saints. The many sons, the heritage to God, and the glorification of the saints all come out of God's divine dispensing. How we need the revelation to see this and the wisdom to know this!</P><P>Regretfully, many Christians deny that we have a spirit, yet Paul prayed that the Father may give to us a spirit. This is not the Holy Spirit but the human spirit. Paul did not pray that we would have a spirit of power, the kind of so-called power the Pentecostals stress. Power is not what we need. Christ is what we need. We need the wisdom to understand and the view as a revelation for us to see. We need the eyes of our heart to be enlightened. Have we ever heard that our heart has eyes? Our spirit needs the wisdom and revelation, and our heart's two eyes need the enlightenment. We have eyes, but we may have no sight and no light. Without the enlightenment of the divine light, we cannot see.</P><P>Paul prayed that the eyes of our heart would be enlightened that we may know three things. The first thing is the hope of God's calling. The second thing is the riches of the glory of God's inheritance in the saints. That means God in His economy through His dispensing will get an inheritance, a heritage of worth, and this heritage will be full of glory. The riches of this glory are unsearchable. Paul also prayed that we would know the great surpassing power that operated in Christ, which is toward us. This is the power that raised up Christ from the dead, from Hades, that seated Christ above all things in the heavens, that subjected all things under His feet, and that gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. This is not common teaching. This is why I have the burden to stress that we all need to have this prayer. We should pray, "Lord, in these days in which You are moving in Your recovery on this earth, I need a spirit of wisdom and of revelation. Lord, give me such a spirit as a great gift."</P>
