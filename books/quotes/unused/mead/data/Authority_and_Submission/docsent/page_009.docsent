   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Service Originating from God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here we see a very solemn matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Serving God and offering strange fire are two similar matters, yet they are very different.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Service to God originates from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is man serving God through submission to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The result is acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Strange fire, however, originates from man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no need of obedience to God's will or submission to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All that is needed is man's zeal, and the result is death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We often incur more death the more we serve and work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Under such circumstances we have to ask God to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Are we under the principle of service, or are we under the principle of strange fire?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's Work Being a Coordination in Authority</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Nadab and Abihu worked apart from Aaron, they were working apart from God, because God's work is a coordination in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God ordained that they serve under Aaron's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament there are Barnabas and Paul, Paul and Timothy, and Peter and Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In all these we see a responsible one who leads on the one hand and a helper who follows on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's work some are set to be authorities while others are set to submit to authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God desires that we be priests according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, we have to serve God in the order of the coordination in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a person who should not take the lead begins to take the lead, there is rebellion and death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, anyone who serves God without touching authority is offering strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If someone says, "Since So-and-so can do it, I can do the same," this is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God pays attention not only to whether or not there is fire, but also to the nature of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rebellion can change the nature of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All that is not instructed by Aaron, that is, not instructed by God, is strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's concern is with the upholding of authority, not just the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason, man should be a follower.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He should always be a complementing one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A deputy authority follows God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who submit to authority follow the deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In spiritual matters or spiritual works it is not an individual serving, but a corporate Body coordinating in serving.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The unit of service is coordination, not individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Nadab and Abihu got into trouble with Aaron, they got into trouble with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They could not work apart from Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anyone who violates authority will be devoured by the fire of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even Aaron himself did not know that the matter was so serious, but Moses knew the solemnness of rebelling against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are many who think that they are serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet they work independently without coming under any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many have sinned without realizing that they are rebelling against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, the free-lance evangelists who were prevalent in China in the past were a great loss to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE REVILING OF AARON AND MIRIAM Incurring God's Anger by Reviling the Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Aaron and Miriam were the older brother and sister of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the family Moses was under the authority of Aaron and Miriam.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in God's calling and work, Aaron and Miriam were under Moses' authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were not happy about Moses marrying an Ethiopian woman, and they spoke against and reviled Moses, saying, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Has he not spoken through us also?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Num 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ethiopians are Africans.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are the descendants of Ham.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was not right for Moses to marry an Ethiopian.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Miriam was older than Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was all right for her to rebuke her brother on the ground of family relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in opening her mouth, she touched the work of God and overstepped Moses' position.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In His work, God had placed deputy authority in the hand of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was a big mistake for Miriam and Aaron to speak against Moses because of family problems.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God appointed Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But Miriam despised Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this reason, God was not happy with her.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is all right for you to deal with your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But it is not all right for you to speak against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Neither Aaron nor Miriam knew God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They fostered a rebellious heart by standing on natural ground.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Moses did not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He knew that if he was God's appointed authority, there was no need for anyone to protect him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whoever spoke against him would touch death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He did not need to open his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as God had given him authority, he did not have to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A lion does not need protection because it is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Moses first submitted to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then he was able to represent God as authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He was very meek, more than all men who were on the face of the earth v. 3 . The authority which Moses represented was the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All authorities are delegated by God, and no one can take them away.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Their words of rebellion ascended upward and were heard by God v. 2b . When Aaron and Miriam offended Moses, they offended God in Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, God became angry.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once a man touches deputy authority, he touches God in that person.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once he offends the delegated authority, he offends God.</S>
