   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE 6 Date:February 27, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong ONE BODY AND ONE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 12 14 is mainly on spiritual inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although chapter thirteen deals specifically with love, it speaks of the relationship between love and gifts; it is not just an expos on the doctrine of love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is proven by the last verse of chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I show to you a most excellent way refers to the love spoken of in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The previous verse says that men from different backgrounds are baptized into the same Holy Spirit and are all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although each one of us has received Christ, we can act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, the church in Philippi was in one accord for the furtherance of the gospel on the one hand, and yet found itself not being of one mind and not thinking the same thing on the other hand Phil 1:5; 2:2; 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, we must not only receive Christ, but also we must be baptized in one Spirit into one Body and must drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can find an analogy in ice cubes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A block of ice can be broken down into small ice cubes, and each one of us can hold a piece.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we put these cubes into water and melt them together, they will become one piece of ice again after freezing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 4 speaks of seven factors of oneness of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Two of these seven factors are one Body and one Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Corinthians 12:13 explains this one Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The one Body comes from baptism, and the one Spirit comes from the common drinking of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this verse we find three main points.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, we are all baptized into this Spirit, who is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, we are all baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, we are made to drink of this one Spirit to whom we belong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The last two points the baptism into one Body and the drinking of one Spirit come from the Holy Spirit in the first point.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to see that the second and third points are in apposition to the first point.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as the one Body comes from the one Spirit, our drinking also comes from the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the driving force.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The result is the one Body and the drinking of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 12:13 specifically explains how the one Body and one Spirit come about.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE Visitation</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition to the need for zeal and earnestness, there are two crucial qualifications for those who are engaged in visitation work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first is love, and the second is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a man has zeal and nothing else, he will only generate commotion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only those who have love can care for others, and only they can comfort the brokenhearted and strengthen the weak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who have problems generally have a story in their heart to tell.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we have love, others will pour out their hearts to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A person engaged in visitation must not only have love but also must have the wisdom to say the right thing and respond the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A Principle Governing Church Service</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One principle governing church service is that the work and the service must be assigned; they must be placed in the hands of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The affairs of the church cannot be in the hand of just a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more people are involved in the church, the stronger the church service will be.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Selecting the Right Person to Do the Job</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In selecting the right person to do the job, the first qualification we should consider is a person's willingness to do the job.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The next thing we should do is to teach this person how to work and to work together with him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The qualification for working in the church is not ability, but willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is all right if a person does not have the skill to do a job.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as he is willing, he can be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The most important thing in church service is to select those who are willing to work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The next thing to consider is whether or not they are good at what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Making Arrangements for the Services</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order for the whole Body to rise up to serve, all the brothers and sisters have to be busy with something.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, we have to make arrangements for the majority of the saints to get into some areas of service.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First, all the brothers and sisters have to be assigned to some service.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Second, the responsible brothers have to carefully look into all the arrangements with the responsible ones of each area of service.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Third, there is the gospel parade team and the gospel visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a service in which all the brothers and sisters can participate.</S>
