   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FOURTH CONFLICT A. On God s Side</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the fourth conflict with Pharaoh, the Lord smote all the borders of Egypt with frogs 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Frogs came up from the waters of the rivers, the streams, and the ponds.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By coming upon Pharaoh, all his servants, and all the Egyptians, the frogs destroyed the enjoyment of the comfortable Egyptian living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How troublesome these frogs were!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By sending the plague of the frogs upon the Egyptians, the Lord wanted the Egyptians to realize that their life in Egypt was not really a life of enjoyment, but a life of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Egyptians did not realize that, in the eyes of God, all their enjoyments were frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything they gathered from the Nile, the source of the world s supply, was a frog.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The waters in Egypt that once produced fish now brought forth frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In principle, we may experience the same thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout the course of my life, I have gathered many things that turned out to be frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At first, I enjoyed these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But one by one, they became frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What I thought was a fish was actually a frog.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sooner or later, everything you gain in this world will become a frog.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that everything you gather up from the Nile, the source of supply for the world, will be a cause of trouble to you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Material possessions and even people dear to you can be frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the things we treasure turn into frogs, then we realize that the enjoyment of the world is not the true enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, it is very troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The frogs in Egypt did not kill anyone, but they were a nuisance to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were everywhere in their houses, in their bedrooms, upon their beds, in their ovens, and in their kneading troughs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a nuisance!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether the plague of the frogs was a form of punishment or a revelation depended upon the attitude of the people who were subject to the plague.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they had received the Lord s mercy, it would have been a revelation to them, an exposure of the fact that Egypt with its enjoyment is a land of frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the meaning of the living of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every aspect of the world s enjoyment is a frog.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who refused the Lord s mercy, however, had to endure the plague of the frogs as a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. On Pharaoh s Side</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Egyptian magicians were able to do three of the things that Aaron did with his rod: change the water into blood, change the rod to a serpent, and bring forth frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With their enchantments Pharaoh s magicians brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt 8:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, they could not take the frogs away.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A preacher of the gospel must be able to bring forth frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that he must cause people to realize that all the enjoyments and preoccupations of the world are frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, certain philosophical teachers also are able to make people realize that the things of the world usurp them and damage them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Evangelists expose the real situation of living in the world, but some magicians or philosophers can do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we preached the gospel in China, we frequently encountered such magicians, the philosophers of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We told the people that life in the world usurps them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some of the philosophers taught the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, Taoism teaches simplicity and selflessness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also told people that the enjoyment of this world is actually a form of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some philosophers taught this also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, just as the Egyptian magicians were not able to take away the frogs, so today s magicians cannot take away the frogs that trouble people in our time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those philosophers in China could bring forth the frogs, but they could not make them disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Moses cried unto the Lord concerning the frogs, the Lord did according to Moses word 8:12-13 , and the frogs died out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same principle, a proper evangelist not only brings forth frogs, but also causes them to be driven away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes as we preached to certain of the wealthy people in China, we caused frogs to appear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This convinced them that the enjoyment of the world is really a nuisance, a cause of unending trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At their request, we prayed for them, and the frogs were taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this only served to show us that their condition was the same as Pharaoh s after the frogs were taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart and did not hearken to Moses and Aaron 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same principle, when these rich people saw that the frogs were removed and that there was relief from their situation, they refused to repent and believe in the Lord.</S>
