   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD'S FULL REDEMPTION AND SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN CHRIST 7 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:30; 1 Pet 5:10a; Heb 2:10; Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21; Eph 1:13-14; 4:30</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The divine revelation concerning the divine economy and the divine dispensing is the central line among the many lines in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The terms divine economy and divine dispensing are new to most Christians because few know the teaching of God's economy in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word economy, the anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia, was stressed very much by the apostle Paul in his Epistles Eph 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek word oikonomia refers to a household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, God's economy refers to God's household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this administration there is a marvelous arrangement for God to dispense Himself into His chosen, created, and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's divine economy, His household administration, is carried out by His divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The central thought of God's redemption and salvation is to work Himself into His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God redeemed us and saved us so that He can work Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He also created us with a body, a soul, and a spirit for this purpose 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Outwardly, we have a body, and inwardly we have a spirit deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Between our spirit and our body is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians do not know that man has a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They consider the spirit, the soul, the mind, and the heart as one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, 1 Thessalonians 5:23 definitely mentions the human spirit as one of the three parts of our being, and Hebrews 4:12 even says that man's soul and spirit can be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I began to minister in the United States thirty years ago, I stressed the matter of the human spirit very much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wherever I went I spoke on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many told me that they had never known that they had a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They had heard only about the Holy Spirit, not the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the life of many Christians is poor because they have missed the organ for the Christian life the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul said, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the Spirit of God can indwell the spirit of man to such an extent that the two spirits become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The dispensing of God is very much related to the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First of all, God Himself is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this verse there is no article between the words is and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that the phrase "God is Spirit" refers to the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The essence of a gold ring is gold, and the essence of a steel table is steel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, the essence of God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, if we would worship such a God who is Spirit, we must worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only so, the Second of the Divine Trinity, after becoming flesh and dying on the cross and entering into resurrection, became a life-giving Spirit John 1:1, 14; 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, the Son also is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, the Third of the Divine Trinity, the Holy Spirit, also is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the three of the Divine Trinity are Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The essence of the entire God, the complete Triune God, is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Holy Spirit is the flowing, the reaching, of the Triune God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The three of the Divine Trinity are Spirit for the purpose of dispensing the Triune God into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the evening on the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples, breathed upon them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates very clearly that God's intention in His redemption and salvation is to make Himself one with His redeemed people by the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is Spirit, and we have a spirit; therefore, God can make Himself one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only Spirit can touch spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, God as the Spirit touches our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has regenerated us in our spirit John 3:6 , and He is now dwelling in our spirit to make our spirit one with His Spirit 1 Cor 6:17 a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the central line of the divine revelation, and this is the divine dispensing of the Divine Being into our being.</S>
