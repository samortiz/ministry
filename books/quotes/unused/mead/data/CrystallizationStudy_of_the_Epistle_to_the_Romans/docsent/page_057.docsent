   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 1:4, note 4 revised</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast to the flesh in v. 3.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the flesh in v. 3 refers to the human nature of Christ in the flesh, so the Spirit in this verse does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God but to the divine essence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself John 4:24 , the divinity of Christ, is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh which He received through His incarnation John 1:14 not in His Spirit as His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His Spirit as His divinity did not die at the cross when His flesh died; rather, His Spirit as His divinity was made alive, enlivened, with new power of life, so that in this empowered Spirit as His divinity He made a proclamation to the fallen angels after His death in the flesh and before His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Especially we worship You as the God-man.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You are the reality of all the revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not just want the vain revelations without the reality.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We surely need Your covering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You know how the enemy is struggling to fight against the release of Your word in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, show us how You became man in Your divinity to bring Your divinity into man and how You became the life-giving Spirit and the firstborn Son of God bringing humanity into divinity.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He lived a human life but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then He went to the cross, was crucified there, and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first marvelous and excellent thing which transpired in Christ s resurrection was the designation of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Designated means resurrected.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Quite often, some revelations in the Bible are too deep, far beyond our human understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Apparently, all the Christians who read the Bible have come to know that Christ has two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because He is both God and man, He possesses the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
