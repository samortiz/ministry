   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN THE SIGNS IN JOHN NINETEEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 19:1-42</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although chapter nineteen of the Gospel of John may be very familiar to us, we may not see the reality in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This chapter is full of rich extracts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message and in the message following we shall consider twelve major points with a number of subpoints, all of which are related to the extracts of this deep and rich section of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our concern in these messages is to present not the facts but the extracts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In giving this message I assume that you have at least a general knowledge of the content of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us, then, now consider the major points, the signs, in John 19.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE SIGN OF A THORN CROWN AND A PURPLE GARMENT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sign of a thorn crown and a purple garment signifies the rejected Messiah, or King, of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This sign is important because the entire chapter is on the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter first we see who the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the Messiah, the anointed One of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This term denoted the King of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the One who was crucified was not a common man, a common figure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the contrary, He was the One anointed of God, the One whom God had anointed to be the King of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although God had anointed Him, the people rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They rejected their King, the very One whom they had been expecting for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even as they were rejecting Him, they were still expecting the coming of their Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 19:1 and 2 say: "Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And the soldiers, having plaited a crown out of thorns, put it on His head, and threw around Him a purple garment."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was done as a mockery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both the thorn crown and the purple garment signify kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A crown, of course, is worn by a king, and the color purple signifies kingly honor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even this mockery of the Lord Jesus was according to the sovereignty of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sign of the thorn crown and the purple garment signifies Christ's kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SIGN OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 17 says, "And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this verse we have the cross as a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians think that the cross is primarily a matter of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to their understanding, to bear the cross is to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some of us may still hold to this traditional thought.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Concerning this, the well-known book, The Imitation of Christ, has exercised a great influence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because this book matches the natural concept, I valued it very highly when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I, too, regarded the cross as being a matter of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I spoke concerning the cross many years ago, I sometimes told the saints that if they were suffering in their circumstances, they were experiencing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a brother's wife gave him a difficult time, in this situation he was bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The point we are making here is that according to our natural concept, the cross is a matter of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, according to the facts of history, it was not the purpose of the cross to cause suffering; instead, the cross was for terminating people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When someone was put on the cross, the purpose was to terminate him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is clearly the meaning of the cross in John 19.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 15 indicates this: "They cried out then, Away with him, away with him, crucify him!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This verse indicates that for the Lord to be crucified, to be put on the cross, is for Him to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The cross, therefore, is not for suffering; it is for termination.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to realize that the special significance of the cross in this chapter is that the cross terminates the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It terminates the things, the matters, and the people of the old creation, all of which are contrary to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anything that is against the purpose of God needs to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In God's economy this termination is accomplished by the death of the cross.</S>
