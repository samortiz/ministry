<h2 class="head2">Swatow, Kwangtung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>During May, the city of Swatow experienced several bombings. Thank the Lord that all the brothers and sisters in the Lord are safe. During the crisis, about thirty brothers and sisters remained in Swatow. Thank the Father for His grace; all of them are safe. The incident gave us an opportunity to know God through our experience. We believe that God is our hiding place and a shelter for our life. May all the glory go to Him forever, amen. Brother Wen-kwang intends to travel by boat to Kulangsu. Brother Ge-chen left for the inland regions on June 21.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Hsie Tze-shun and Chen Fang-ching, July 13</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Most of the brothers and sisters who were working at the steamship company or who were engaged in embroidery work have lost their jobs. But thank the Lord that He has sufficient grace. They are able to get by for now. We do not know what to do in the future. May the Lord grant us grace and open a way for His people.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Hsie Tze-shun and Chen Fang-ching, August 3</p><h2 class="head2">Jien-Ou, Fukien Province</h2><p>Brother Jie-dun has been here for two months. He had overly exerted himself, and I asked him to come for a rest. Lately, he has improved a little, but he is still weak and unable to bear any stress.</p><p>Jien-Ou experienced a large-scale bombing on June 25 and the sixth of this month. The first time we were in a meeting. Over fifty people were listening to a message. Soon a fire spread in a wild way. We were only a tree's distance from the fire. The leaves on the other side of the tree had already changed color. Yet we were all safe and continued to break bread as usual. The second time the bombing came we were a few hundred feet from Small Pear Hill. A house behind us received one bomb, and a large building received another bomb. The elementary school across the street received several bombs. Dust filled the air, and when we lifted up our heads, we found almost everything gone. Yet the amazing thing was that our house did not sustain any damage except some fallen roof shingles. The partition between the meeting room and the back room also fell. In the past we have complained that our room was not big enough for meeting. When Brother Chen Ke-san was here for a conference, I asked the owner to allow us to tear down the partition so that we could add more chairs. The owner was a devout Buddhist, and he thought that it could not be removed because it had Buddhist images. I could not do anything then. Thank the Lord, He bombed the images away. The next day the owner removed everything, including the idols and ancestral plaques. The front and back rooms spontaneously became one room, and the place was one-third larger. We really thank and praise the Lord! The Lord even moved the owner's heart to do some remodeling for us. We are safely living here. We can only say to the Lord, "We praise for the past, and we trust for the future!"</p><p>Sister Liao Ong Yu-bing, July 29</p><h2 class="head2">Han-Jiang, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear ones:</p><p>Some of the believers have moved into the country because of the war. For this reason we would like to inform you of a change in our meetings so that you can pray for us. (1) There are eight to nine saints who have moved to Ma-Yang-Chun in Kwang-Yeh-Li (which is in the mountains, about fifty Chinese miles from Han-Jiang). They would like to have a meeting, but because of the lack of responsible brothers, they are not able to do so. Please pray for them. (Sister Chiung-ying has moved there.) (2) There were originally twenty to thirty brothers and sisters in Shang-Lin-Chun (eight to nine miles from Han-Jiang). They have started a meeting, and the nearby saints gather around there as well. Brother Tsai-seng may move his family there. (3) There were originally five brothers in Tung-Yuen-Chun in Jiang-Kou-Jen (thirty miles from Han-Jiang). I have moved my family there. Should it become necessary, we will move further into the mountains. We hope to start a meeting so that the neighboring brothers and sisters can have a place to meet. Please pray for this. (4) There are about six to seven sisters in Duo-Tou-Chun (eight miles from Han-Jiang by the sea). They do not have a suitable place to move, but they want very much to have a meeting. Because there is no brother there, they only have a prayer meeting. Please pray much for their future. (5) There are still over ten brothers and sisters left in Han-Jiang. They break bread on the Lord's Day afternoon in the believers' homes, and they have a prayer meeting on Saturday afternoon. The original meeting hall will be returned to the owner next month. In the future, please mail any letters to [omitted]. All the Lord's people in Pu-Tien and Han-Jiang have been preserved. Please pray much for us.</p><p>Brother Fang Shi-rong<br />July 17</p>
