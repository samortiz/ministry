   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>VARIOUS PERTINENT MATTERS CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Finally, we have to mention two or three things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In particular, we have to take care of one matter in the bread-breaking meeting: As those who are cleansed by the Lord s blood, we do not come to ask for the cleansing of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As those who have received the Lord s life, we do not come to ask for His life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we should have only words of blessing in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The cup of blessing which we bless.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, we bless what the Lord has already blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the night that He was betrayed, the Lord took bread and blessed it, and He took a cup and gave thanks Matt 26:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There the Lord only blessed and gave thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the Lord broke the bread, He and the disciples came out singing v. 30 . The proper tone for this meeting is blessing and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this meeting, we do not plead or preach.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It may be all right to speak something directly related to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It may not even be necessary to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But definitely any other kind of preaching is unsuitable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul s word in a bread-breaking meeting in Troas in Acts 20 was an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should restrict ourselves to only thanksgiving and praise in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We break bread once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord instituted the supper, He said, This do, as often as...</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 Cor 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The early church broke bread on the first day of the week Acts 20:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our Lord not only died but also resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We remember the Lord in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first day of the week is the day of the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The most important thing on the first day of the week is to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope that all the brothers and sisters would not forget this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must also be counted worthy when we remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 11:27-29 says, So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The most important thing to remember when we come to the table is to be counted worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not refer to whether or not the person is worthy but whether or not his attitude is worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a person belongs to the Lord, he can partake of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he does not belong to the Lord, he cannot partake of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, it is not a question of whether the person is worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a question of the attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is wrong for us to be careless and not discern the body when we partake of it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why the Lord wants us to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although there is no problem with our person, we must realize that we are partaking of the Lord s body while we are eating.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not be careless, sloppy, despising, or loose in attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must take it in a manner worthy of the Lord s body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord has given us His blood and His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should receive them and remember the Lord in a godly way.</S>
