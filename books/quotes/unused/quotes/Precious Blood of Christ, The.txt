To sustain your physical life, you need certain basic items such as water, oxygen, food, clothing, and shelter
These three-separation from God, feelings of guilt, and accusation from Satan-can be three big problems in your Christian life
But your iniquities have become a separation Between you and your God And your sins have hidden His face From you so that He does not hear
In other words, God is not as much concerned with what sins you may commit, as He is with the fact that your sins separate you from Him
When John the Baptist first saw the Lord he proclaimed, 'Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world'!
John 1:9 says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
On the night of the Passover, the children of Israel were within the house while the blood of the lamb was without
Within the house, they could not see the blood; nevertheless, they had peace through knowing that God was satisfied with that blood
Like a window which is never washed, the conscience grows darker and darker until eventually little light can penetrate
Not even a nuclear bomb can dislodge this stain; no, your conscience demands something more powerful than that
You cannot just throw away the ticket, because the police hold a copy, and they will prosecute you if you do not pay
Third, you have guilt in your conscience, like the traffic ticket in your pocket, as a nagging reminder of your offense
Now, the first two problems have been solved: God is no longer offended, and the debt of sin has been fully paid
Just as when the fine is paid, the traffic ticket may be torn up and thrown away, so also any guilt on your conscience may be wiped out
Remember 1 John 1:9: 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
As Psalm 103:12 says, 'As far as the east is from the west, / So far has He removed our transgressions from us'
In the book of Zechariah, the high priest, Joshua, stood before God and Satan stood at his right hand 'to be his adversary'
All these general feelings of condemnation that have no apparent source in sin are of Satan and should be rejected
Satan's accusations are like that-like a dripping faucet, or like a nagging wife-they will not let you go to sleep
If you confess your sin and claim the precious blood yet some uneasiness continues to tug at you within you should stop praying immediately
By the power of the precious blood of Christ, it is possible for a Christian to live moment by moment in God's presence
Whenever any little sin would come to frustrate your fellowship with God, you may instantly confess and claim the Lord's prevailing blood
If we walk in the light as He is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin
