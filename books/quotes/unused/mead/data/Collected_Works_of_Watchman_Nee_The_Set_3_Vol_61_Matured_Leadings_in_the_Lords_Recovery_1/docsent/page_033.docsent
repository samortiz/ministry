   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHERE THE TREASURE IS, THERE THE HEART IS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We say that we are giving our heart to the Lord, yet our mammon is in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, let us consecrate the mammon in our bank, and then the heart will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only the Lord can see our heart, because only He is the one who searches the inward parts and the hearts Rev 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason the Lord said that where a man's treasure is, there is his heart also Matt 6:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is very easy for us to set our heart on the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All we have to do is to send our money there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is impossible for our heart to be set on the things above while our mammon is in the bank below.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every man's heart is set on the earthly things because his mammon is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord never tries to eradicate the root of sin in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Similarly, He never asks us to give up mammon to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He only says, "If your heart is truly after God, you have to place your mammon on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you bring your mammon to God, your heart will truly love God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord does not ask us to give Him our heart, but He does ask us to bring Him our money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our mammon must be deposited in heaven first before our heart will go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we say that we want to hand ourselves over, we have to bring our heart and mammon to God at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let me shout this again: The Lord does not say that we should not love mammon and love God instead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, He says that we should send our mammon to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because our heart follows our mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only does the world's heart follow mammon, even a Christian's heart follows mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our heart will always go where our mammon is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should never think that only the world loves money and that Christians do not love money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Christian can love money too.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Christian's heart is the same as the heart of someone in the world; both go after mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The only difference is that a Christian's mammon is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are Christians, and we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What should we do now?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should send our mammon to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Spontaneously, our heart will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man's heart always loves money.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a man says that he does not love mammon, he is deceiving himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Men in the world put their mammon in one place, while a Christian puts his in another place heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the only difference between a Christian and a person in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can feel our love for the Lord by offering up our mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, we should not just offer up what we have in excess.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to offer until our heart hurts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the heart hurts, we know that our heart has gone out to where our money is, and we will find joy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It will be easy for us to love God, and our love for Him will flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me repeat this: Where our treasure is, there is our heart also.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Following this statement the Lord said that no man can serve two masters Matt 6:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord says no man, He means no man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No man can serve two masters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we want to serve God, our money has to go.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not aspire to be anything in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I only aspire to gain God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let me say this in a most respectful way: Our God can be bought with money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No one can accumulate mammon on earth yet have his heart in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not fool ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The matter of handing oneself over is not just an exercise of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One has to hand over his person as well as his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is very easy to shift the heart, but it is not easy to shift material things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I want to emphasize this: It is useless to say that one offers up his heart without offering up his things at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If our heart goes to the Lord, our things have to go to Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our heart is very arbitrary; it can turn back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord said that where our treasure is, there is our heart also.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If my treasure is not with God, my heart cannot rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It will be in God one moment and in the world the next moment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord says that no man can serve two masters at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When He says no man, He means no man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What Does It Mean to Hand Over "All"?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps some will ask to what extent we have to offer ourselves before we can say that we have handed over our "all."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whatever we have, we should offer it and hand it over to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we really feel the hurt, we have handed over our "all."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When a man truly hurts from his giving, he enjoys the greatest joy in giving.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A man laughs when he is happy, but he also weeps when he is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The greatest happiness is a happiness that makes a man weep.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This happiness has a special taste.</S>
