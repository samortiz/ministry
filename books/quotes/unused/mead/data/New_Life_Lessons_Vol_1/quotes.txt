[1]  Now you have the life of God and are a beloved child of God.
[2]  The salvation which we received from the Lord is precious and secure.
[3]  Since you have believed, called, and been baptized, by the Word of God you can know assuredly that you are saved.
[4]  I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God.
[5]  To a Christian, it is the means by which he contacts and absorbs God.
[6]  At the same time, when our prayers are based upon the Word of God and we pray with the Word of God, we will have full assurance concerning the will of God and will have the confidence that God hears our prayers.
[7]  Prayer is not based upon our condition, behavior, or anything of ourselves, but upon:
[8]  Only the blood of the Lord can satisfy God s righteous demands and can cleanse us that we may draw near to God with boldness.
[9]  Our prayer must be in the Lord s name; this means that we must pray by depending on the Lord and by being joined to the Lord.
[10]  When we rely on the Lord s blood and are joined to the Lord s holy name, we will have a conscience void of offense.
[11]  That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.
[12]  God has given us two great spiritual inheritances: the invisible Holy Spirit within us and the visible Bible in our hand.
[13]  This lesson will guide you into the rich treasury which God has prepared for you in the Bible.
[14]  Hence, if a believer desires to know God well, he must read the Bible.
[15]  You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life, and it is these that testify concerning Me. John 5:39
[16]  You search the Scriptures...and you are not willing to come to Me the Lord that you may have life.
[17]  Therefore, every time you open up the Word of God, you should pray from the depth of your being:
[18]  If you do not yet have a plan and a life of reading the Bible, we hope that by the grace of the Lord you will make a resolution that from now on you will practice the following:
[19]  THE CENTER OF THE CHURCH LIFE I. THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING
[20]  Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together is the Bible s command, as well as God s command to His children.
[21]  If we cease meeting together, we interrupt the church life, because our meeting life is the church life.
[22]  To...all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.
[23]  The greatest commission God has given to us is to preach the gospel.
[24]  This was the Lord s final charge after His resurrection at the time of His ascension.
[25]  That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.

[27]  Since it is God who desires that we pray, He has to answer our prayers.
[28]  If you will pray for them with faith and persevere in preaching the gospel, in due time you will bear fruit and glorify God.
