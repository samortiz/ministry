This Bible is a complete revelation. Although it consists of sixty-six books, it has only one revelation. This revelation is a complete whole; it is complete in its entirety. In this complete revelation there is one central point. Although believers throughout all the ages have read the Bible extensively, most of them have missed the central point. The central point in the Bible is very clear; it is Christ as our life. Christ is not only life, but He has become our life. This is the central point of the Bible.<p>Christ becomes our life to fulfill God&#8217;s plan. God has an eternal will, and in this will He has a plan. His plan is to gain a group of people to express Him. For man to express God, it is necessary for God to enter into man to be his life. Consider this: If God does not enter into man and live out Himself through man, how can God express Himself, and how could man express God? Perhaps you have seen a variety show featuring two performers, one of whom speaks while the other acts out the gestures. Similarly, I can hide behind a brother, while he acts out whatever I say. It seems that this is an expression of me, but it is actually not so; he is expressing himself. The only way for me to be expressed through him is for me to enter into him and live out myself through him. However, this is impossible for me to do. I cannot enter into him, much less can I live out through him. Therefore, I cannot express him, and he cannot express me. This, however, is the very thing God can do. God can work Himself into us. In other words, God has become our life. Only God is able to do this; no one else can do this. God has wrought himself into man. This is God&#8217;s central point in the Bible. When God becomes our life, He is Christ, and this Christ is the Spirit.<p>Genesis 1 reveals to us that God created man in His image and after His likeness. We have to insist on asking why He would create man thus. There are two answers. The first answer is that God had to create man to be like Himself. If you have your picture taken, and it does not turn out to be like you but looks like a tiger or a demon, this picture does not express you. Likewise, since God wanted man to express Him, He had to create man to be the same as He is. According to the Bible, man is a &#8220;photograph&#8221; of God because man was created according to God&#8217;s image and likeness for God&#8217;s expression. The second answer is that God created man to be like Him so that one day He could enter into man. If you have something that needs to be contained, you need to find an identical container, such as a box that is of the same size and shape as that thing. For example, if the thing to be contained is round, you need to find a round box. If the thing to be contained is square, you need to find a square box. The best illustration of this is a glove. A glove is made entirely according to the shape of a hand so that the hand can fit into it. One time I saw someone making a glove with one section for the thumb and one other section for the four fingers. This was a mixed-up item. I greatly disapproved of what I saw, for that was not a glove but a mitten. A proper glove must have separate sheaths: one for the thumb, one for the index finger, one for the middle finger, one for the ring finger, and one for the little finger. Everything must be according to the shape of a hand so that the hand can properly fit into it. God created man in His image and after His likeness for the same reason. God wanted to one day enter into man and feel comfortable in man. God desires to enter into you that He may put you on and make His home in you.<p>Furthermore, Genesis 2 reveals that in the creation of man, God breathed the breath of life into man&#8217;s body. The breath of life was a wonderful thing. According to the Bible the breath of life became the spirit in man, because the word breath in Genesis 2:7 is translated into spirit in Proverbs 20:27. In other words, the word spirit in Proverbs 20:27 and the word breath in Genesis 2:7 are the same in Hebrew. This shows that the spirit of man is the breath of life that was breathed by God into man in the beginning. When God created man, He used two materials. One material was physical, that is, the dust of the ground. God used the dust of the ground to form the body of man. The other material was spiritual, that is, the breath of life; it was intangible yet living. The body made of dust was tangible, but not living. When the breath of life entered into man, man became a living soul. Thus, man has a body on the outside and a soul inside, and within the soul there is a spirit, which is the organ for him to receive God.<p>God&#8217;s creation of man was very special. First, God created man to be like Him that man might have His image. Second, God created man with a spirit as a receptacle. Therefore, when you consider a man, on the one hand, he has an image that is the image of God; on the other hand, he has a spirit within him that is solely for the purpose of receiving God. This spirit may be likened to the receiver installed in a radio for the sole purpose of receiving radio waves.<p>We know that in Genesis 1 and 2 God had not yet practically entered into man. Man was still an empty vessel. Although man had the image of God outwardly and was a receptacle to receive God inwardly, God had not entered into him yet. After God created man, He placed this empty vessel before the tree of life. If you read and understand the Bible, you can see that the tree of life signifies God as our life. The tree of life is God Himself. God&#8217;s intention in putting man before the tree of life was for man to receive God into him. Moreover, at the outset the Bible speaks clearly that the way to receive God is by eating. We know that if we want to receive anything into us, we need to eat it, but the things we eat must be organic. In other words, if you eat a piece of stone, it will not have any organic reaction within you; it is inorganic and cannot be absorbed into your bloodstream or cells. But if you eat something nutritious, an organic process will take effect within you. For example, a few hours after you eat a piece of fruit, it will become your cells and eventually will become you. It is often said that you are what you eat. Whatever you eat, that is what you will be. If you eat mangoes, then you will smell like a mango. I sometimes tell the Americans that they smell like cows because they drink so much milk and eat a lot of steak. Therefore, if you eat beef, you will become a &#8220;cow.&#8221; This kind of speaking does not sound nice. However, if we eat Christ, we will become Christ. Do you believe this?<h2 class=head1>EATING CHRIST AND LIVING CHRIST</h2><p>The theologians in Christianity do not have the concept of eating Christ and living Christ. If they hear this kind of speaking-&#8220;eating Christ to become Christ&#8221;-they are bothered and are quick to judge it as heresy. They wonder first of all, how can we eat Christ? Secondly, how can we become Christ? However, the Bible is very clear concerning this. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&#8221; (John 6:57). This word is not my speaking; it is the speaking of the Lord Jesus and is recorded in the Bible. Later, a disciple who was called Paul also declared, &#8220;For to me, to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21a). Can you see this? Eat Christ and live Christ. The words eat and live are not adjectives but verbs. I eat Christ and I live Christ. Eventually, to me, to live is Christ. This is not heresy.<p>We have been fighting for this truth for many years in America. America is known as a Christian nation, and it has old, traditional theology. Since the Lord&#8217;s recovery went to America, we have released messages on eating Christ. The theologians and seminary professors in that country said, &#8220;This man from China is of a small stature, yet he is so bold; we have never heard such a thing as eating Christ!&#8221; They began to fight against this teaching, and we also fought back. After fighting for a period of time, they stopped and conceded defeat. This is because the light in the Bible is very clear. It is sufficient simply to read John 6:57, where the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;He who eats Me.&#8221; Therefore, they could not argue any longer. After that, we released messages declaring that if you eat Christ, you will become Christ. They began fighting again, saying, &#8220;Now we have found reason to say that you indeed teach heresy. Christ is God, so how can you say that you are Christ? Do you really mean to say that you can become God?&#8221; But Paul clearly said in Philippians 1:21, &#8220;To me, to live is Christ.&#8221;<p>Now let me ask you if you can declare, &#8220;To me, to live is Christ&#8221;? Can you? Your &#8220;amen&#8221; is quite feeble. I know you may be thinking, &#8220;This word is right and is clearly in the Bible. However, I am not Paul. An hour before the meeting time, I had an exchange of words with my wife at the dinner table. How can I say that I am Christ? I cannot lie, so I cannot say that I am Christ.&#8221; Therefore, if I ask you if you can declare, &#8220;To me, to live is Christ,&#8221; you can only utter a soft &#8220;amen.&#8221; This is not a proper Christian. Today Christians will not make this declaration, &#8220;To me, to live is Christ,&#8221; mainly because they disobey the Spirit. This is a pitiful situation. Nevertheless, we need to see that a Christian who is up to the standard is one who eats Christ and who lives out Christ; perhaps we should not use the word &#8220;out&#8221; and simply say, who lives Christ.<h2 class=head1>MAN&#8217;S TWO SINS BEFORE GOD</h2><p>In the Bible we see that in this time of the New Testament, man has only two sins before God. If you are not a believer, you will go to the lake of fire and perish there not because of any other sin but because of your not believing into the Lord Jesus. In John 16:9, the Lord said, &#8220;Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me.&#8221; The unique sin of the unbelievers before God today is the sin of unbelief. This is because God does not charge us to do anything other than to receive the Lord Jesus. In the Old Testament there were the Ten Commandments. In the New Testament, however, there is only the one commandment: Repent and believe in Jesus. This is the one and only commandment. Whether you commit sins or do good, you should repent and believe in Jesus. If you do not believe in Jesus, your unbelief is sin; this is the unique sin. In the future all the perishing ones will go to the lake of fire not because of stealing or lying but because of not believing in the Lord Jesus. Many good men will end up in the lake of fire in the coming age, even though they have never committed murder, robbery, or adultery. Perhaps they will argue with God, saying, &#8220;I have not sinned, so why am I here in the lake of fire?&#8221; God will say, &#8220;It is because you do not believe in Jesus.&#8221; People perish because of their unbelief.<p>After believing in the Lord, we have another sin. Many brothers and sisters are not sensitive to this. What is this sin? It is the sin of not living Christ. Your not living Christ and not living by Christ is the greatest sin. I saw this many years ago but did not have a strong consciousness of it until mid-July of last year when I was on a mountain having a quiet, intimate time with the Lord. At that time I practiced confessing my sins daily. Whenever I had a wrong intention, said a wrong word, or had a wrong attitude, I would confess my sins. Every day I would confess my sins just like I would wash my hands. Then the Lord asked me, &#8220;Have you ever confessed this one sin, that you do not live Christ?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Lord, forgive me! I have not confessed this sin. Although I have confessed saying the wrong thing or having a wrong attitude, I never confessed this sin of not living Christ. O Lord, I do not live You out. O Lord, I do not live You. O Lord, forgive me!&#8221;<p>From that day on, I would confess this sin thoroughly before the Lord. Then I found out that there is no end to the daily confession of this sin. It is extremely difficult for us to live Christ every moment of the day. I did a little calculating for myself and for others as well. There are twenty-four hours in a day. After deducting eight hours for sleeping, there are still sixteen hours. How much of the remaining sixteen hours do I spend living Christ? I found out that I may not even have two hours of living Christ. In the other fourteen hours although I did not commit any sin, neither did I live Christ. Do you see this? Within the sixteen waking hours, I had only two hours at most in which I was living Christ.<p>These two hours of living Christ started with my prayer time. In fact, at the beginning of my prayer time, I was not in my spirit but still in my mind. Then gradually I prayed myself into my spirit. When I prayed myself into my spirit, I lived Christ in my spirit. When I prayed, I lived Christ. After praying, I was living in my spirit, but this did not last long. After five minutes Sister Lee asked me, &#8220;Yesterday you gave some money to So-and-so. Why did you not discuss this with me first?&#8221; Her questioning halted my living of Christ. Immediately I turned to my mind, asking, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; This was not to live Christ. I spent the next fifteen minutes telling her all the reasons, and in those fifteen minutes I did not live Christ. What did I live? Even I myself do not know. I did not sin or lose my temper, but neither was I in my spirit living Christ. This would go on until two or three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon; then I sensed something was wrong. I turned to the Lord to confess, &#8220;Lord, I did not live Christ throughout the day. Although I did not do anything wrong, I have been living in myself. Lord, I am not trustworthy. Lord, forgive my sin! Lord, remind me that I am one spirit with You, and You are one spirit with me. I do not want to live outside of this spirit. I want to live only in this spirit.&#8221; After my confession I felt much better within and sensed the Lord&#8217;s sweetness, and I was again in my spirit living Christ. However, at this moment the phone rang, and I picked up the receiver. That one phone call got me out of my spirit again. Also there were times when the telephone did not ring, and I was just working and not committing any wrong, yet I still was not living Christ.<p>What do I live when I am not living Christ? First, ethics; second, logic; and third, biblical teachings. For example, when a husband and wife who are believers quarrel, they condemn themselves. But suppose that, instead of quarreling, they love each other, yet not in spirit. Since not loving each other in the spirit is not counted as a sin, they do not condemn themselves but rather consider that they are doing the right thing. In this way, every day we live mostly either according to ethics or according to logic; we spend very little time living Christ in our spirit. One day I did a little more calculating. I am afraid that even the best brothers and sisters among us live Christ only five percent of the time; ninety-five percent of the time they do not live Christ. Some are contentious and do not live Christ; others are peaceable and never say much, but they also do not live Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, please consider, how much do you live Christ in a day? After the creation of man, God placed man before the tree of life that man might eat of the tree of life. However, man foolishly ate of another tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We all know that the tree of life signifies God, whereas the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies anything that does not belong to God. For example, your ethics, logic, humility, and pride all belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil includes not only things that are evil but also things that are good. We invariably think that our goodness does not belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We are wrong. Both our goodness and our badness belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Whether you are moral or immoral, whether you are honest or dishonest, whether you steal or do not steal, whether you are a robber or a gentleman, whether you are quarrelsome or peaceable, whether you are a shrewd woman or a virtuous woman, all belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Anything that is not of God belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. By this you can see that only a small percentage of your living is of the tree of life; ninety-five percent is of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<p>Most of us have become well-adjusted after being in the church life for a long time. Let us use a husband and wife as an example. Before they were saved, the husband was rude, and the wife was ill-tempered. Then they were saved and came into the church. One day they had a discussion. One said, &#8220;We have now come into the church. Look at the church people. In general, they are better than we. So from now on we should not be rude or ill-tempered.&#8221; Indeed, after a few years under the influence of the church they gradually changed and were no longer rude or wild. The more they lived the church life, the more they were conformed to the image of the church. Is this Christ? No. Is this the tree of life? No. When this brother was rude, his rudeness was not of the tree of life but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Now he has improved; instead of being rude, he looks very much like one who is in a local church. Even so, his behavior is still of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The same is true with the wife. Many of her relatives and friends praise her, saying that she has changed. Both of them have changed. However, whether changed or unchanged, their behavior is of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<p>Brothers and sisters, forgive me for being frank with you. When I see your faces today, I have a few words that I must say to you. Have you noticed that among the unbelievers, the ladies paint their lips red, powder their cheeks white, and color their eyebrows black? The red, white, and black colors are not real; these are all masks. We thank and praise the Lord that when you come to the local churches, you do not see these masks. The sisters here neither paint themselves red nor powder themselves white; they do not apply any color at all to themselves.<p>In America I saw many young men with long hair and beards. When they walked into the meeting hall, I, a Chinese, had to examine them closely to determine whether they were humans or demons. They were actually humans, but from the back they looked like demons, and from the front they looked like cats full of whiskers. After they had been in the church life for a period of time, they cut their hair short and shaved off their beards. I was very happy to see their new look. At first, I thought that this was the transformation of the life within them. I had also boasted to others, saying, &#8220;You see, the local church is very powerful; it can cause a long-haired man to cut his hair short and a bearded man to shave his face clean. This is the transformation of life.&#8221; However, after a while, I realized that this was not the transformation of life but a conformity to what they saw in the local church. Why do I say this? Because even though a person&#8217;s hair has been shortened and his beard has been shaved away, his nature remains untouched. Do you believe that this one has truly been transformed? No, he has not been transformed but has merely changed his attire. If he were truly transformed, not only would his hair be shortened and his beard shaved off, but his nature would also be dealt with. Hence, the length of the hair and having a beard or no beard are of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and are not of life. Life is Christ Himself.<p>Dear brothers and sisters, God wants neither our long hair nor our short hair, neither our pride nor our humility, and neither our love nor our hatred. What God wants is Christ. God&#8217;s intention is to work Christ Himself into us. Your living out Christ is the greatest pleasure to God. Sadly, today there are too many substitutes for Christ. The tree of life involves only one item, that is, life, whereas the tree of the knowledge of good and evil involves hundreds of items, such as religion, ethics, doctrines, knowledge, good and evil, honesty and hypocrisy, and pride and humility. Anything that is not of God is of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This is where the distinction lies. For example, you may be an evil man who is prone to lie and steal. From the human standpoint, you should not behave like this; rather, you should be humble, ethical, and honest. However, from the point of view of the spiritual life, merely being humble, ethical, and honest are not necessarily a spiritual living. What God wants is not that we live a moral life, but that we live Christ. You should not live in your mind but in your spirit, nor live in your knowledge but in fellowship with the Lord. Neither should you live according to outward regulations but according to Christ. Furthermore, you should not live according to doctrines but according to the Spirit. Always remain in your spirit to have fellowship with Christ and thus live out Christ from within you. This is what God desires. This is what we lack today.<p>The way of the church is right, and the ground of the church is proper. There is not the slightest problem along these lines. However, on this right way and on this proper ground, we need the Spirit as the content. We need the tree of life to be our content. We have to be full of God and full of Christ. This is not only a matter of the way and of the ground of oneness but also of a practical testimony. We have to live out the Spirit and live out Christ. When we live in constant fellowship with Him by praying unceasingly, we will ultimately have the boldness to say, &#8220;To me, to live is Christ.&#8221; I hope that the brothers and sisters will not feel it is enough to love the Lord. You must see that it is one thing to love the Lord and another thing to live the Lord. There are many who love the Lord, and I believe that most of you love the Lord. If you did not love the Lord, you would not be here. I am afraid, though, that very few brothers and sisters live Christ. Loving the Lord is one thing; living Christ is another thing.<h2 class=head1>PRAYING UNCEASINGLY, BREATHING CHRIST, AND LIVING CHRIST</h2><p>God desires not only that we love Him, but much more that we live Him and live Him out. If we love Him, we will live by Him instead of living by ourselves. To live Christ requires that we pray unceasingly. This kind of prayer is not for our daily affairs but for our contact and fellowship with Christ. If we pray only for our daily affairs, we will not be able to pray unceasingly. It is not possible to pray continuously twenty-four hours a day for our daily affairs. Besides, we do not have that many daily affairs to pray about. Praying unceasingly is a spiritual breathing. This is not a matter of praying for daily needs but of breathing in Christ. If you pray to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, You are my life; I am one spirit with you; Lord, You are in my spirit,&#8221; you will live in your spirit and will be in constant fellowship and contact with the Lord. At all times and in all places, the Lord is in you to be your life and to be one with you. In this way you will be delivered from religion, ethics, and logic, and you will truly live out Christ in your spirit. This is what God desires.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>ONLY LIVING CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:23; 15:5; Gal. 2:19-20; 5:2, 4; 6:15</h1><h2 class=head1>MAN LIVING BY THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2><p>God&#8217;s eternal plan is to work Christ into us. Christ is the embodiment of God. Thus, Christ being worked into us is God coming into us to be our life. In Genesis chapters one and two, it is clearly revealed that God created man for this purpose. God wanted man to be His vessel so that He Himself could enter into man to be his life. However, man fell. Man fell because he did not receive God as life, but rather he received something else. God wanted man to receive life; instead, man received the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<p>The tree of life is simple; it is simply life. But the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is complicated; it includes knowledge, good, and evil. In man&#8217;s eyes, evil is something undesirable, while both knowledge and good are much to be desired. Everyone loves to have knowledge and good. If we do not have knowledge, others think we are stupid, and if we are not good, others despise us.<p>From the beginning of time up to the present, the existence of the human race has been depending on these two things: knowledge and good. Immediately after you were born, you began to receive knowledge. When you were little, your parents sent you to kindergarten, and then they sent you to elementary school, high school, and college. Then just one degree was not sufficient; you had to go to graduate school to get a master&#8217;s degree, and after that a Ph.D. Wearing one Ph.D. cap was not enough; you had to wear two or three more. Knowledge is what the people of the world desire and seek after today. Knowledge is their human life and their future. Those who have knowledge are considered upper class, while those who do not are lower class. The entire human society lives by knowledge.<p>Furthermore, there is the matter of good. Man must live according to morality and ethics to be a good person. To elaborate somewhat, this is to have kindness, love, humility, patience, gentleness, and a willingness to yield to others out of humility. &#8220;Yielding to others out of humility&#8221; is a unique virtue of the Chinese. In the Western languages there is no proper translation of this phrase. For example, if there were one and a half seats here, would you sit on half a seat or on one whole seat? In general, the Europeans and Americans do everything according to the law. If the law says that a person can have half a seat, then he would take half a seat; if the law says that a person can have a whole seat, then he would take the whole seat. Whatever people are allowed by law, they would not give it up even to their own father. Western people do not know what it is to yield in humility; therefore, such a phrase cannot be found in their dictionary. Yet yielding is a traditional virtue among the Chinese. If there were one and a half seats here, a Chinese would yield not only the one seat but also the half seat. Orientals, especially the Japanese, pay much attention to yielding to others. Is this good? It is truly good; this is one of the best virtues. In terms of virtue, the Chinese and the Japanese are on top. The Westerners know how to claim but not how to yield. Therefore, the Oriental culture is superior. The Orientals are a cultured people. However, this is the goodness from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<p>Today the three things that human society pays constant attention to are knowledge, good, and evil. Every country and every society are full of knowledge, good, and evil. Evil is condemned while knowledge and good are exalted. What is human culture? It is the development of knowledge and the spread of good. In human culture there is technology, philosophy, and religion. Technology and philosophy spread knowledge, whereas religion promotes good and uplifts morality. In addition, the law restrains people from committing sins. In China, there is an idiom, &#8220;to rope people by the law,&#8221; that is, to prosecute people by the law. The law is like a rope, tying people up. Therefore, the law restricts people.<p>Look at the Philippines today. If technology, philosophy, religion, and the law were removed, what kind of people would the Filipinos become? They would be bandits, robbers, or wild beasts. This is true not only of the Philippines but also of every other country in the world. Therefore, these four items must not be abandoned; technology, philosophy, religion, and the law are necessary items in human culture. The stronger a country is in these four aspects, the greater will be its national strength.<p>Nevertheless, we must know that these four items are replacements of Christ. We may ask three young brothers to come up to the platform for a demonstration. We can see that all these three young brothers have been saved. Do they have Christ? They do. However, what do they live by every day? They live by Christ for only a little time. Perhaps while praying at home they enter into their spirit and live by Christ. Furthermore, during the meetings when they have forgotten their own thoughts and emotions, they live by Christ. However, most of the time they are neither living in the spirit nor are they living by Christ. Sometimes even their eyes are rolling and their minds are wandering. They see that the elders are not good, the brothers are worse, and the sisters are even more disappointing. In the meetings they are watching, condemning, and criticizing. Therefore, at times even in the meetings they are not living by Christ. What do these three brothers normally live by? First, they live by technology. They may consider themselves young people of the space age, and therefore they cannot be without technology or knowledge. Second, they live by philosophy. They may say, &#8220;We are Chinese who were born in the Philippines. We have the Chinese philosophy and the Filipino philosophy. We have a philosophy of the East meeting with the West.&#8221; Third, these brothers live by religion. Their religion, which is the local churches, is first-rate and the most cultured. Fourth, they live by good, morality, and ethics. They have all these items, and they even have them on two levels. One level is the Chinese ethical traits such as meekness and patience. Consider the Chinese character for patience; it is a sharp knife stuck into the heart. This is patience. Moreover, these brothers are willing to yield to others. Another level is that they were born into a Christian family and were raised in a local church. They have not only morality, but they also have the knowledge of the Bible. They normally live by these four items: technology, philosophy, religion, and ethics.<p>Now if I ask, &#8220;Brother, in the past week, did you go to the movies?&#8221;, he will say, &#8220;No.&#8221; If I ask, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go?&#8221;, he may say, &#8220;Because there were not any good ones.&#8221; Did you hear what he said? He says he did not go because there were no good movies worth watching. He considers that the movies are not good and disdains them because he is rich in knowledge. If these movies were shown to the country people, they would think that they are great. However, this very knowledgeable young man will not go because these movies are not up to his standard. If I ask the second brother, &#8220;Why did you not go to the movies?&#8221;, he replies, &#8220;When I go to the movies, I feel very uncomfortable within, so I do not go.&#8221; This seems to be somewhat related to Christ. It seems that it is Christ in him who would not allow him to go to the movies. Perhaps for the first two times, his uneasiness may be due to Christ. However, later on it may be because he is afraid that it would not look proper if others should see him. It may also be that he feels that as one who is in the church he should not go to the theater. He may have a standard for being a Christian. If he were to go to the movies, he would feel that that is improper and have no peace in his heart. Now if I ask the third brother, &#8220;Why did you not go to the movies?&#8221;, he replies, &#8220;This is the custom of the local church.&#8221; Did you hear him say that the local church&#8217;s custom is to not go to the movies? He is a good brother in the local church, so how can he go to the movies? In any case, you all can hear what these three brothers have said. None of them say that he did not go to the movies because Christ lives in him.<p>If I ask a sister, &#8220;Do you quarrel with your husband?&#8221;, she may reply, &#8220;Sometimes I want to quarrel with him, but after some consideration, I get the feeling that it would be better not to.&#8221; I would ask, &#8220;Please explain a little as to why you feel that it would be better not to quarrel,&#8221; to which she replies, &#8220;This is due to different reasons. First, in front of the children, it is not proper to quarrel.&#8221; Brothers and sisters, you can see that this sister is living her children instead of living Christ. She continues, &#8220;The second reason is that there are young brothers around, which also makes quarreling improper.&#8221; Again you can see that this sister is living the young people instead of living Christ. Then she says, &#8220;The third reason is that sometimes it is truly Christ who lives in me.&#8221; Brothers and sisters, do you see that Christ&#8217;s living in her is not listed first but last? There is still another reason that I can describe for you. You may feel this way: &#8220;Now that I am in the church and I am living the church life, how can I quarrel with my husband? This would truly be unseemly. Therefore, I must set up a good example and not quarrel.&#8221; Is this living Christ? No, this is merely a kind of religious living. I believe now you are all clear. Do not think that only one sister is like this; all of the sisters are the same. Even the brothers are not any different.<p>There are some elders who are too impetuous; they speak, act, decide, and handle matters in a quick way. The result is that they hurt others. There are other elders who are full of experience; they do everything slowly to avoid hurting others by being too quick. When they are asked by anyone about anything, they say, &#8220;Wait a minute, let me pray about it; I cannot give you an answer today.&#8221; However, this is to live wisdom and not Christ. Day by day we read much about Christ, pray much to Christ, and hear much about Christ, but we do not live Christ very much.<h2 class=head1>MANY THINGS REPLACING CHRIST</h2><p>Throughout the ages, there have been too many substitutes for Christ. Perhaps we should call them replacements of Christ. Many things have replaced Christ. I have divided them into two big categories. The first category comes from God. This will definitely shock you, causing you to wonder how things from God can replace Christ. The more obvious ones are two items. The first item is the Bible. Many Christians have made the Bible a replacement of Christ. The Lord Jesus once told the Pharisees, saying, &#8220;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life&#8221; (John 5:39-40). Today there are many theologians and Christians who read and study the Bible, yet they are not willing to contact Christ in their spirit. They have made the Bible a replacement of Christ, and they even put Christ aside.<p>The second item is the law. The Mosaic law was given by God but the Jews replaced Christ with the law. The reason Paul wrote the letter to the Galatians was that, after believing in the Lord, the believers in Galatia returned to the law and replaced Christ with the law. Paul seemed to be saying to the Galatians, &#8220;O Galatians, because you believed into Christ, you are now in Christ. All of Christ&#8217;s riches and grace have become blessings to you, yet you have now returned to Judaism to keep the law. O Galatians, I want to tell you that if you return to the law, then you are separated from Christ and fallen from grace. This is to say that you are severed from Christ and have reduced yourselves to nothing.&#8221;<p>In the original language, Galatians 5:4 implies, &#8220;When you were saved, you entered into Christ. God grafted you into Christ. Thus, all the riches of the life of Christ as the tree have become blessings to you who are the branches. However, since you have returned to the law, you have ruined your status. You have reduced yourself to nothing and brought to naught all of the rich grace in Christ. Hence, you have fallen from the grace of Christ. You are deprived of grace and of all the riches in Christ.&#8221; The law was given by God to be used temporarily by Him until Christ should come. Now that Christ has come, the law should be set aside. You should only remain in Christ and not return to the law.<p>Perhaps you would say, &#8220;Today we have nothing to do with the law.&#8221; However, I must tell you that although you do not have the law given by Moses, you do have your self-made laws. Especially all those whose will is strong have their own laws: &#8220;I do not do this; I do not do that; I am a well-behaved person. My will is strong, my mind is sober, and my emotions are proper; therefore I have regulation one, regulation two, and regulation three. This is my human life.&#8221; This is your law, and it is not Christ. Thus, the Bible and the law have become replacements of Christ.<p>Even the gifts today have become replacements of Christ. Some people speak in tongues, some heal the sick, and some practice other gifts. Although these are things given by God, they can become replacements of Christ.<h2 class=head1>REPLACEMENTS FROM HUMAN CULTURE</h2><p>The second category of replacements for Christ comes from human culture. Not one nation is without culture. The book of Colossians deals with culture. At that time the believers had fallen totally into culture. Colossae was in Asia Minor, and among the Colossians, some were Jews and others were Greeks. The Jews had their religious philosophy; the Greeks had their Gnostic philosophy. These two philosophies intermixed to become the Colossian philosophy, which the Colossian believers received and by which they lived and walked. Therefore, Paul said, &#8220;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him....Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ&#8221; (Col. 2:6, 8). According to the Bible, all philosophies are elementary things. Although the Chinese speak of The Great Learning, it is nonetheless elementary. Therefore, the philosophy and tradition referred to in these verses are things of human society. In the early days these things invaded the church in Colossae to replace Christ.<p>Among us here we have Chinese, Japanese, Indonesians, and Filipinos. Consider yourselves. Are you living Christ today, or are you living yourselves as Chinese, Japanese, Indonesians, or Filipinos? I know that even among the overseas Chinese brothers and sisters, those from the Philippines have one flavor, those from Indonesia have another flavor, those from Malaysia have a third flavor, and those from Thailand have a fourth flavor. There is only a bridge separating Malaysia from Singapore, yet the flavors from the two sides are not the same. You all live the many flavors of the overseas Chinese, but you do not live Christ.<p>Consider three brothers from Japan, three brothers from Indonesia, and three brothers from the southern islands of the Philippines. You may see that all these brothers have been saved and have Christ in them. They have the same Bible and sing the same hymns. However, forgive me to say that they seldom live Christ. What do they live? These three live Japan, these other three live Indonesia, and the last three live the southern islands of the Philippines. It is not the Christ who lives in them that directs them. Sometimes there is a little of Christ living in them but not much. There are replacements in them. What are these replacements? They are the Japanese culture, the Indonesian culture, and the southern Filipino culture. All of these different cultures have been constituted into their blood to become a part of their being. Although we love the Lord and we say that we live by the Lord, in reality, instead of living the Lord, we live our culture. Unconsciously we are living in our culture.<p>The fact is that not only does each region or each race have its own culture, even all of us individually have our own self-invented culture. Consider the three Japanese brothers. They are genuine Japanese, but each has his own individual philosophy, and each has his own individual culture. If you want one brother to jump, it is very easy for him to jump; if you want another brother to jump, even if you threaten to kill him, he will not do it. All three brothers have been saved; all have Christ within them; all have the same Bible, sing the same hymns, and shout the same slogans. However, each one lives his own individual culture, because each one is living himself. Besides sleeping eight hours a day, they still have another sixteen hours of the day. At most they spend one hour in the spirit, in which they forget about Japan, forget about themselves, and live Christ. However, apart from this brief time, what do they live? They live technology, philosophy, local church religion, and their own moral standard, but not Christ.<p>Brothers and sisters, please consider if there is any one of you who is without his self-invented culture. Sometimes you hear a brother say, &#8220;Brother So-and-so shouldn&#8217;t have done this, and Sister So-and-so shouldn&#8217;t have done that. I am not boasting, but I myself would never do things in their way. I am not that kind of person, and I would not do things according to their kind of principle.&#8221; What is this? This is your own culture, invented and enforced by yourself. Then there are times when you hear a sister pray, &#8220;O Lord! I thank You and praise You for saving me and putting me in the church. Lord, from this day forward I will do such and such.&#8221; The numerous things she subsequently mentions are part of her own self-invented culture. Therefore, brothers and sisters, when you are not living Christ, you are living your self-invented culture.<p>All that I have said is to prove to you that it is really difficult to live Christ, and it is even more difficult to live only Christ. Most of the time we do not live Christ. What we live are scientific knowledge, philosophy, religion, or culture. There are too many replacements of Christ. The sinful, evil ones allow wickedness and the world to replace Christ. While wickedness and the world do not have too much room in us, things such as scientific knowledge, philosophy, religion, and culture still have too much ground in us. Unconsciously, unintentionally, we live these things instead of living Christ.<h2 class=head1>LIVING ONLY CHRIST IN SPIRIT</h2><p>However, the Bible tells us that as we have received Christ, we ought to live and walk in Him. We should not live technology or philosophy or religion or the law; rather, we should live Christ and live and walk in Christ. Paul said that we need to be careful to not let anyone carry us off as spoil, taking us away from Christ through the tradition of men or the elements of the world (Col. 2:8). We must remain in Christ. Let philosophy go, let the law go, and let culture go; just remain in Christ. Christ surpasses technology, philosophy, religion, the law, and culture. Take care of only living in Christ and of living Christ.<p>Who is Christ? What is Christ? Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit. He is not only the Sovereign One over all, the One who is in the heavens on the throne, but He is also the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit living in your spirit now. He is in your spirit, and He is joined with your spirit as one spirit. You need to remain in this spirit, live in this spirit, breathe in this spirit, pray in this spirit, and fellowship with Him in this spirit. Christ as the Spirit in your spirit should direct you in everything. Then you will live Christ, and what you live out will be Christ.<p>Today all of you have clearly heard and seen that it is not knowledge, good and evil, religion, or culture, but it is Christ. You must live Christ. However, I am afraid that right after the meeting, you will altogether forget this message. By this afternoon you will go back to your culture and back to your living the local church religion. As long as you are not living in spirit, you are not living Christ; you are living something else. There are too many other things that are replacements of Christ. Mere doctrines regarding Christ are not Christ, the life-study messages are not Christ, and even the Bible is not Christ. We must see that Christ as the Spirit has entered into our spirit to become one spirit with us. Only this Spirit is Christ. To live Christ is to live this Spirit. You need to understand this and simply remain in the spirit: live in the spirit, walk in the spirit, pray in the spirit, and let go of all other things. This is to live Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVING AND WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4, 6, 14; Gal. 5:25; Eph. 6:18; 1 Thes. 5:17, 19; Rev. 1:10a</h1><h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD BECOMING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2><p>The Bible ultimately shows us one thing: God passed through creation, incarnation, more than thirty-three years of human living on earth, and death on the cross; then He came out of death and was resurrected. In this wonderful resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit as the consummate expression of the Triune God. This Spirit is on the throne today and is also moving on the earth, waiting for people to receive Him. Wherever one is, as long as he is willing to repent and believe into the Lord Jesus by calling on His name, the Spirit will immediately enter such a one. This wonderful Spirit thus becomes one spirit with the spirit of this believing one. This is the mystery of mysteries in the universe. This is also the greatest, highest, deepest, and richest mystery in the universe.<p>Since the Triune God went through creation, incarnation, thirty-three and a half years of human living, death, and resurrection, He possesses all these qualifications. He is the Creator, the Redeemer, the God-man, and the One who died and resurrected. He has divinity with humanity; in Him are the effectiveness of His marvelous death, the power of His resurrection, and the transcendence of His ascension. Furthermore, He is the Ruler on the throne with all authority; both the kingdom and glory belong to Him. All positive things are concentrated on Him and in Him. He is truly all-inclusive. As long as you receive Him and let Him come into you, the riches of His all-inclusiveness also will come into you. He is within you today as the Spirit. The Spirit, the rich Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit who passed through death and was raised from the dead, the Spirit with the effectiveness of death and the power of resurrection, is now in you. Hallelujah!<p>Everyone who believes into Him has this Spirit. Furthermore, as He is in our spirit, He becomes one spirit with our spirit. &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17). What a glorious thing it is that we and the all-inclusive Lord have become one spirit! He is we, and we are He. He and we, and we and He are one spirit. In this one Spirit there are divinity, humanity, power, life, holiness, and glory. All the fullness is in Him.<h2 class=head1>LIVING AND WALKING ONLY ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>What then shall we do? We do not need to do anything; we simply need to live and walk according to the Spirit. I hope that you all can see this, remember this, appreciate this, and praise the Lord for this. Hallelujah, I have become one spirit with the all-inclusive Spirit! What a marvelous salvation this is! Oh, how glorious is the story of the new creation! His redemption is eternally effective and truly worthy of our praises. This is not religion, nor ethics, nor morality, nor culture. This is the all-inclusive Spirit dwelling in our spirit. How glorious! This is the Spirit according to whom we live and walk. This is all that we need. This is the crystallization of the entire Bible. This is what the sixty-six books of the Bible are all about.<p>We know that when people cook food in a kitchen, the food goes through many processes. They have to kill some items and cut them into pieces; they have to put some items in a pot to be boiled and other items in the fire to be roasted; they have to add this and that. If you go to the kitchen to take a look while they are busy there, you will find a mess. You will see grease, blood, water, and fire. However, after all these processes are completed, there will be many delicious dishes set before you for you to eat. Likewise, in His economy the Triune God had to pass through various processes that He might become the Spirit. He passed through the processes of creating all things, becoming flesh, living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, entering into death, passing through death to subdue and conquer death, coming out of death, and entering into resurrection. After these processes, a delicious dish was ready. This delicious dish is the all-inclusive Spirit. All you need to do is repent and believe, call on the Lord&#8217;s name, pray and receive Him; then this delicious dish will become your portion. We do not need to do anything; we only need to enjoy this Spirit.<p>Brothers and sisters, this Spirit is the tree of life in Genesis 2. What is the tree of life? It is the Triune God who went through creation, incarnation, human living on the earth, death, and resurrection to become the Spirit presented to you. You should receive Him, eat Him, and enjoy Him, and you should live and walk according to Him. This is different from religion, morality, and culture, which all require that you do something. Only the tree of life does not require you to do anything. You simply need to receive, to eat, to drink, and to live and walk according to Him.<h2 class=head1>THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2><p>At this time I would like to impress you with this word: live and walk according to the Spirit. Whether it is ethics, religion, law, or anything else, each one tells you what to do. I want to tell you that as long as you ask what to do, that is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Do not ask what to do; simply eat and drink. That is the tree of life.<p>In Christianity we see that when a pastor marries a young couple, he says, &#8220;So-and-so, you are taking an oath before God today that you will marry So-and-so to be your wife. You have to promise before God in front of the congregation that you will love her forever. The Bible says that husbands should love their wives. Will you promise to do this?&#8221; The bridegroom will say, &#8220;I promise.&#8221; Let me ask you, what is this? Is this the tree of life or the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Yes, this is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Then the pastor will turn to the bride and say, &#8220;So-and-so, now you are going to marry So-and-so. You also have to swear before God and promise me that you will take this man as your head and submit to him for your whole life. Will you promise to do this?&#8221; In that kind of a situation every bride and groom would promise to do so. Some would say, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and others would simply nod their heads. Let me ask you, What is this? Is this the tree of life or the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Anything that requires you to do something is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; only that which invites you to eat is the tree of life.<p>The Bible ends in a call and a promise. The call is: &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely&#8221; (Rev. 22:17). The promise is: &#8220;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life&#8221; (v. 14). The call is to take the water, and the promise is to eat the tree. Do not ask, &#8220;How can I overcome? How can I be holy? How can I be spiritual? How can I be this? How can I be that?&#8221; All of these are the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<p>Let me talk about marriage again. The pastors who marry people do have this experience. Not long after the wedding, the bridegroom will come to him and say, &#8220;On the wedding day you told me to love my wife. I tried my best to love her, but I have to tell you that up to this day it has not been possible. I simply cannot do it. This is why I am here to seek your advice. How can I love my wife? You just don&#8217;t know; my wife is the most difficult woman in the whole world.&#8221; The next day the bride also will come and say to the pastor, &#8220;Pastor, when you married us, you wanted me to take him as my head. I want to tell you today that I cannot take him as my head. You simply don&#8217;t know what kind of head he is. It is impossible! I am here to seek your advice. What should I do?&#8221; Every pastor has to be ready with a reply. The pastor most likely would turn to the verse in Ephesians 5 which says, &#8220;Husbands, love your wives.&#8221; He would tell the man, &#8220;So-and-so, you should not make comparisons, saying that Mr. Chang&#8217;s wife is better than your wife, Mr. Lee&#8217;s wife is better than your wife, and even all the wives are better than your wife. If you appreciate others&#8217; wives, that is not to love your own wife. But God says that you should love your own wife.&#8221; The man would argue, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know. She is really unlovable; I cannot love her.&#8221; The pastor would say, &#8220;The Bible does not say that you should love your lovable wife; it only says that you should love your own wife. God has given you your wife. Whether she is lovable or not lovable, you have to love her.&#8221; The man would say, &#8220;I cannot do it!&#8221; Then the pastor would say, &#8220;Even if you cannot do it, you still have to do it. You should never get a divorce. Rather, you should pray!&#8221; Let me ask you, what is this? This is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Formerly, the devil seduced man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; now the pastors compel people to eat of it.<p>Let me share a little bit of my testimony. Soon after I was saved, I began to love and seek the Lord and wanted to be an overcomer. First, I wanted to overcome my temper. My biggest problem was that I was quick-tempered; it was so easy for me to lose my temper. The person I loved the most was my mother, but this did not affect how I lost my temper. I did not care; I simply lost my temper before her. Afterward, I felt very sad. I truly wanted to be victorious, so I bought many books with titles, such as &#8220;How to Overcome,&#8221; &#8220;A Guide to Victory,&#8221; &#8220;How to Be Holy,&#8221; and &#8220;A Guide to Holiness.&#8221; When I first read them, I thought they were quite reasonable, but when I put them into practice, they did not work. Then I realized that those books simply teach people how to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which is not what the Bible teaches. What does the Bible say? The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&#8221; (John 10:10b). He also said, &#8220;I am the bread of life....He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&#8221; (6:48, 57b). It seems He was saying, &#8220;I do not come as a teacher to teach you, nor do I come as a pastor to advise you to do certain things. I have come as the bread of life for you to eat. Don&#8217;t ask Me, &#8216;Teacher, what shall I do?&#8217; Just eat Me.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>NOT HAVING METHODS BUT SIMPLY EATING THE LORD JESUS</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; The Lord Jesus came to be eaten by us. But what a shame it is that there are many who read the Bible, many who listen to sermons, and many who give sermons, but there is none who eats the Lord Jesus! May I ask you, How much of the Lord have you eaten today? The tree of life is not for studying but for eating. Where is the tree of life today? It is the Spirit of life in your spirit.<p>Forty years ago, the newly married young men always liked to come and ask me, &#8220;Brother Lee, please tell me how to be a husband.&#8221; At that time this was the kind of question I liked the most. I immediately gave them at least five commandments and told them, &#8220;Take these back with you and do them accordingly!&#8221; In doing that I also was helping people to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But today if you go to the United States and inquire of the young brothers and sisters, they will say, &#8220;If you have problems in your married life, don&#8217;t bother going to Brother Lee. He will not give you any method but will say to you, &#8216;Just eat the Lord Jesus, and that is good enough.&#8217;&#8221; Their word is true. Now I have no methods at all. This is not a joke. Simply eat the Lord Jesus. Dear brothers and sisters, no matter what question you bring to me, I can give you only one answer. There is only one way. There is no need for you to prepare to do anything. Simply say to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, You are in my spirit, and I am one spirit with You.&#8221; This is good enough; do not say anything more.<p>When I fellowshipped with the younger ones about this, someone would invariably ask, &#8220;Brother Lee, your way is very good. But suppose after I go home tonight, my husband loses his temper again with me, what shall I do? Can you tell me a good method to follow?&#8221; You see that by asking such a question, this one immediately turned to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. I would say, &#8220;I just told you not to do anything, think anything, or suppose anything. You only need to tell the Lord, &#8216;O Lord, You are the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, You are in my spirit, and I am one spirit with You. O Lord, this is my life.&#8217; This is enough. You can go home in peace.&#8221; However, she would say, &#8220;Yes, it is good that I go home, but what if my husband loses his temper again?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have spoken this much, but it has all been nullified by your question. Don&#8217;t ask any more questions; just go home in peace.&#8221; Why should she not ask further? Because all she needs to do is constantly live and walk according to the spirit, and that is sufficient. When she walks through the door into her house, her husband may ask, &#8220;Where have you been? Don&#8217;t you care about this home any more?&#8221; Now that trouble has come, what should she do? Let me tell you, she should not do anything but just tell the Lord, &#8220;O Lord, You are the Spirit of life. You are in my spirit, and I am one spirit with You.&#8221; Her husband may say, &#8220;Are you so spiritual? Is the Lord in your spirit but not in my spirit?&#8221; Then what should she do? She still should not do anything but again say to the Lord, &#8220;O Lord, You are the Spirit of life, You are in my spirit, and I am one spirit with You.&#8221; Her husband may say, &#8220;Are we going to eat or not?&#8221; She should neither say yes or no but turn to the Lord and say, &#8220;O Lord, You are the Spirit of life, and You are in my spirit.&#8221; I believe that this Spirit will lead her to cook, so she should cook. While she is cooking, she should praise the Lord, &#8220;You are the Spirit of life who lives in my spirit. Hallelujah!&#8221; This is to live and walk according to the Spirit.<p>You do not know how to honor your parents, how to be a good wife, how to love others, and how not to lose your temper. You do not know anything. The only thing you know is: &#8220;Lord, You are in my spirit, and I am one spirit with You.&#8221; Oh, this is glorious! Try it. You need to exercise and practice doing this. This is not religion, ethics, or the law, but Christ.<p>Today you need to know what is the Lord&#8217;s inward desire. The Lord&#8217;s inward desire is to live in you as your life and person. This is neither a superstitious belief nor an empty doctrine but a true fact. I believe that you have had this experience at times when your prayer went well, and you prayed yourself into the spirit. Oh, how good it was! When you pray yourself into the spirit, you forget heaven and earth; you forget everything except the Lord. This spirit of prayer should be the atmosphere of our normal life. We should not be in such an atmosphere only when we are praying; rather, we should bring this atmosphere into our living. In our entire living, we should be living in an atmosphere of prayer. The Bible says, &#8220;Unceasingly pray.&#8221; This unceasing prayer does not mean that you pray unceasingly for many daily affairs. Rather, it means that you breathe and enjoy the Lord so that there is an atmosphere between you and the Lord, an atmosphere in which the Lord is with you, and you are with the Lord. The Lord and you and you and the Lord have become one spirit; you simply live in this spirit. This is to live and walk according to the Spirit. If you are willing to do this, you will see that the element of the Lord will be added into you day by day, and you will be sanctified. When the element of the Lord is added into you, spontaneously you would not like to play or joke, neither would you want to buy so many items of expensive clothing. You are not restricted by any outward regulation. However, because the Lord&#8217;s element has increased in you, this increase of the Lord has completely transformed you from within. Henceforth, holiness will be there, and also victory will be there. Without trying to overcome, you spontaneously will overcome. This is because you are one spirit with the Lord, and as you live in the spirit you live and walk according to this spirit.<h2 class=head1>LOVING THE LORD AND LETTING HIM MAKE HIS HOME IN YOU</h2><p>In order for you to have this exercise, you need to do two things. First, every day you need to pray, &#8220;O Lord, I love You. Lord, draw me that I may love You more. O Lord, cause the love in me to be strong, burning, fresh, and sweet day by day. O Lord, I love You.&#8221;<p>Second, do not try to do anything for the Lord to prove that you love Him. Instead, tell the Lord, &#8220;Lord, I love You. Come and make Your home in me. I love You. I long for You to come and make Your home in me.&#8221; That the Lord will come to make His home in us is not a small thing; rather, it is a very great thing. As the Lord of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things, the Lord Jesus became flesh, passed through death, and entered into resurrection. Hence, all things belong to Him. The resurrection life and the riches of the Spirit are His. Today you need to tell Him, &#8220;Lord Jesus, I love You. Come and abide in me.&#8221; When you say this, He will accept and come into you to abide in you. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&#8221; (John 14:23). Thank the Lord, He is the all-inclusive Spirit, and He is real and living. When He comes to abide with us, we enjoy His presence. The sweetness, the rest, the comfort, the strength, and the inward supply are beyond description. In this way we experience and enjoy Him.<h2 class=head1>BEING A PERSON IN SPIRIT</h2><p>The New Testament tells us, &#8220;Unceasingly pray&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:17); &#8220;Do not quench the Spirit&#8221; (v. 19); and &#8220;By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit&#8221; (Eph. 6:18). Eventually, Revelation, the last book of the Bible, tells us, &#8220;I was in spirit on the Lord&#8217;s Day&#8221; (1:10a). What the Bible shows us at the end is a person who is in spirit. Every one of us should pray, &#8220;Lord, make me a person in spirit, and make every day of my life on the earth a Lord&#8217;s Day. I really want to be in spirit on the Lord&#8217;s Day.&#8221; This is good enough. Here you have the church life, not religion. Everyone is in spirit. You are in spirit, and I also am in spirit. Every brother is in spirit, and also every sister is in spirit. We are all in spirit. As a result, we are together here as the church today, and in the future we will be together as the New Jerusalem. This is the union and mingling of God and man; God is in man, and man is in God. The divine Spirit and our human spirit become one spirit, and we live and walk according to this spirit. Hallelujah! This is God&#8217;s eternal purpose and His greatest pleasure.<p>Dear brothers and sisters, do you love God? Do you love the Lord? What is the Lord&#8217;s greatest delight? It is that you and He become one spirit and that you live and walk according to the spirit. You would not care about others&#8217; criticisms, neither would you care about any regulations. All you would care about is to love the Lord, to be one spirit with Him, to fellowship with Him in spirit, and to walk in the Spirit. You live, walk, and have your being in the Lord as the Spirit. This is glory, life, light, power, enrichment, victory, spirituality, and holiness; this is also the church life. One day this will be the manifestation of the New Jerusalem. Do you see this? This is different from religion. Hallelujah, the Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwells in us to be joined with us as one spirit! Today we pray in this spirit, fellowship with the Lord in this spirit, and live and walk in this spirit.</body></html>
