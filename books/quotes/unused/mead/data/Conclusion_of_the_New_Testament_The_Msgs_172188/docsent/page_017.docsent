   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Feeding Them and Giving Them a Drink</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Romans 12:20 Paul says, "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is actually loving our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our love to them will be coals of fire heaped upon their heads to turn them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It may be that by feeding our enemies and giving them a drink, we may, to at least some extent, move and turn their hearts and gain them for the Lord's sake. c Not Conquered by the Evil, but Conquering the Evil with the Good</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 12:21 says, "Do not be conquered by the evil, but conquer the evil with the good."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be conquered by the evil is to repay evil for evil v. 17 . Suppose someone treats you evilly and you treat him evilly in return.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that you have been conquered by the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, we should conquer the evil with the good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that if someone treats you evilly, you give him good treatment in return.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to conquer the evil with the good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3 Praying for Their Persecutors</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament the believers are charged to pray for their persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 5:44b the Lord Jesus says, "Pray for those who persecute you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a wonderful attitude to hold toward the persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Stephen had such an attitude in Acts 7.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he was being stoned, even unto death, he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them!" v. 60 . Stephen prayed for his persecutors in the same way as his Lord, whom he loved and lived Luke 23:34 . a Blessing Them</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only should we pray for our persecutors we should also bless them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Romans 12:14a Paul says, "Bless those who persecute you."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is even more difficult to bless a persecutor than to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, through the divine dispensing this was Paul's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, he could say, "Being reviled we bless" 1 Cor 4:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Peter 3:9 says, "Not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, because to this you were called that you might inherit blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been called to bless others, so we, as a blessed people, should always bless others that we might inherit blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What we bless others with, we shall inherit ourselves Matt 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter's word corresponds to what the Lord Jesus says in Matthew 5:44 and to what Paul says in Romans 12:14 and 1 Corinthians 4:12. b Not Cursing Them</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After charging us to bless those who persecute us, Paul goes on to say, "Bless and do not curse" Rom 12:14b .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is very difficult for us not to curse one who is persecuting us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if we would not curse him with our mouth, there may be a cursing of him deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, in order to bless our persecutors and not curse them, we need to be saturated with the processed Triune God through His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4 Pursuing Peace with All Men</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The believers also need to pursue peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hebrews 12:14a says, "Pursue peace with all men."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To pursue here means to chase, even to chase vigorously.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In having the best attitude toward others, we need to pursue peace, to chase peace vigorously. a Living in Peace with All Men</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The believers should not fight with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we should pursue peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that we endeavor to keep a peaceful situation with everybody, living in peace with all men. b As Far as It Depends on Them</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans 12:18 says, "If possible, as far as it depends on you, living in peace with all men."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to live in peace with others, as far as it depends on us to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men because the other parties are not willing to have a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In such a situation, there is nothing we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the reason Paul says that we should live in peace with all men "if possible."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As far as it depends on us, we should do our best to live in peace with everybody.</S>
