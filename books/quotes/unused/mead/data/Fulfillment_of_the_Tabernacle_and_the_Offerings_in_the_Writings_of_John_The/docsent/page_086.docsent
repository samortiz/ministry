   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHILDREN OF THE DEVIL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As slaves of sin, we are children of the Devil born of fornication 8:44, 41 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter the Jews claimed that God was their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They said to the Lord Jesus, "We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God" v. 41 . But the Lord Jesus told them, "You are of your father the Devil" v. 44 . As sons of the Devil, they were born of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible fornication signifies a relationship that is illegal in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The children of Israel had an illegal relationship with the Devil, and God regarded that relationship as fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who were born of that illegal relationship were children of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The principle is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As fallen human beings, we all are children of the Devil and in this sense were born of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we possess a devilish nature, and for this reason we are slaves of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because we were born of the Devil, we have his evil nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sins we commit are the outward expression of this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sin is an act that expresses the devilish nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is an issue of the devilish nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us use fruit trees as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A peach tree brings forth peaches, and an apple tree produces apples.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The bearing of such fruit is the expression of the inward nature of the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is impossible for a peach tree to produce apples, or for an apple tree to produce peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A peach tree bears peaches according to its nature, and an apple tree bears apples according to its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The principle is the same with our committing sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why do we lie, and why do we hate?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We lie and hate because we have the nature of the Devil, Satan, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapter eight of John speaks of murder, lying, and hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these things are related to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan is a murderer and a liar, even the father of liars.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan is also the one who hates.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These sins are prohibited by the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first four of these commandments are related to God, and the last six are related to humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the Ten Commandments, we are forbidden to murder and to lie by bearing false witness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, who among us can say that he has never lied or never hated someone?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the scribes and Pharisees brought to the Lord the woman caught in adultery, they said to Him, "Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What then do you say?" v. 5 . Their intention was to challenge the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Lord said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her" v. 7 . The Lord's word touched their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones until the last" v. 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This sign indicates that, no matter what kind of person we may be, we are all slaves of sin because we have the nature of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have a devilish nature, the nature of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we have a devilish nature, we hate and lie.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we have a sinful nature, we commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CONDEMNED BY THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As those who commit sin, we are condemned by the law, and we are also under God's condemnation v. 11 . In this chapter the law is represented by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the law, we should be stoned to death for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The law, therefore, condemns us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, as those under God's condemnation, our destiny as fallen people was to die in our sins 8:21, 24 .</S>
