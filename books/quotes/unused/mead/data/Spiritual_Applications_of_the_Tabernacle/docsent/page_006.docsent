   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOING FORTH UNTO HIM OUTSIDE THE CAMP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hebrews 13:13 says, Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must go out of the camp unto Jesus because Jesus has left the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jesus was driven out of the camp and was put to death outside the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The camp would not accept Jesus the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was a religious group who had the Lord in name but worshipped something other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They did not accept the Lord, and they even gave up the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the Lord gave them up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are going to have the presence and the fellowship of the Lord, we have to go out of the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the history of God s people the camp may be seen in at least three periods.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The camp was first the children of Israel after they worshipped the idol in Exodus 32.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They had the name of belonging to the Lord, but in reality they worshipped something else and hence became a religious camp among whom it was impossible to have the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, the Jews in Judaism, the Jewish religion, became the camp at the time of the Lord s living on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They also were a religious group, claiming the name of the Lord but worshipping something other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, Christianity also became the camp, taking the name of the Lord but not worshipping the Lord in spirit and truthfulness John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s presence would not be in the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord s presence left all the camps, and all those who really seek the Lord have to leave the camp, go out of the camp unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who do will have the presence and the fellowship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a very solemn matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to ask ourselves whether we are in the camp or in the tent, even whether we are the camp or the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the very beginning of our practice of the church we stressed this matter very much.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to go out of the camp unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot and we should not remain in Christianity as a religious camp.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We left the denominations because we realized that all the denominations are simply a religious camp.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the eyes of the Lord, Christianity is a camp.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Outside of the camp there is the tent of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we are not in the camp, and we are not the camp people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are in the tent and we even are the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are people who have followed the Lord out of Christianity, out of the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, we have to be very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It may be that after a certain time we will also become the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the camp and what is the tent?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The camp is a religious people who belong to the Lord in name but who in actuality worship something and seek something other than the Lord, while the tent is a separation from that religious group.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>SEPARATION BUT NOT DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is always the separation of the tent and the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to realize, however, that separation and division are different.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Division among the Lord s people is something evil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moses and Joshua were not divided from the Lord s people, but they were separated from them Exo 33:7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, we would never say that we have made a division among the Lord s people, but we would say and even insist that we must make a separation from the camp of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot give up the separation, but we have no intention to make a division.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must differentiate between separation and division.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are going to set up another sect, we will make a division, but we have no intention to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We would not be divided from the Lord s children, but Christianity has become a camp.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because the Lord has come out of it, we must also separate ourselves from the camp and set up the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The tent and the camp are a clear picture of our real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Originally the camp was the place where the Lord s presence and fellowship were, but at a certain point it lost its nature and became idolatrous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the people who know the Lord s heart must leave it and set up a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Immediately after Moses pitched the tent, the pillar of cloud came down to the door of the tent and Jehovah spoke to Moses as a companion, face to face 33:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All those who are seeking the Lord have to go out of the camp and go forth unto Him at the tent.</S>
