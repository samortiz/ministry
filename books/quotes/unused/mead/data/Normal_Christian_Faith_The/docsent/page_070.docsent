   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is a hymn which well describes the joy of this salvation:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why should I worry, doubt and fear?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Has God not caused His Son to bear</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My sins upon the tree?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The debt that Christ for me has paid,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Would God another mind have made</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To claim again from me?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Redemption full the Lord has made,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And all my debts has fully paid,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From law to set me free.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I fear not for the wrath of God,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For I've been sprinkled with His blood,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It wholly covers me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For me forgiveness He has gained,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And full acquittal was obtained,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All debts of sin are paid;</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God would not have His claim on two,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First on His Son, my Surety true,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And then upon me laid.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So now I have full peace and rest,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My Savior Christ hath done the best</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And set me wholly free;</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By His all-efficacious blood</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I ne'er could be condemned by God,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For He has died for me!</S>
