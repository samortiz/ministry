   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Depressions, wavering of faith, dullness of the will, darkness in the mind, suppression in the spirit, inability to pray or control the forces that come from outside, and subjection to these forces have not been ordained by God for a Christian.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any opposing force that runs contrary to God's will can be trampled immediately under our feet because it has been trampled under the Lord's feet already.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we are in the Lord, this force is under our feet also.</S>
