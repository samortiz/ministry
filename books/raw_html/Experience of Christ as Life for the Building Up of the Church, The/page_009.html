<P>The growth in life is Christ increasing within you and you decreasing all the time. If Christ is going to increase in you and you are going to decrease, you need a change of mind in your concept and you need a submissive will. The more we are changed in our mind and subdued in our will, the more Christ will be increased within us. This is the growth in life for the local church.</P><P>We can have the reality of the church life only by the growth in life. If we are short of the growth in life, we are short of the building up. The building up of the church life depends absolutely upon the growth in life. The real growth in life is not the increase of knowledge, of gifts, or of power. It is the increase of Christ within us. The increase of Christ within us requires that we have our mind changed and renewed and our will subdued.</P><P>John 14 shows that we need to have our emotion dealt with. The Lord said, "He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him....If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him" (vv. 21, 23). Love is with the emotion in the heart. Thus, in John 6 the mind is enlightened, in chapter seven the will is subdued, and in chapter fourteen the emotion is stirred up by the Lord. The real love of the Lord will bring Him to you. If you love Him, He will manifest Himself to you. If you love Him, He and the Father will come to you and make a mutual abode with you. This is a matter of the emotion. Our mind has to be renewed, our will has to be subdued, and our emotion has to be stirred up to love the Lord.</P><P>At the end of the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus dealt with Peter in a simple way. The resurrected, glorified Lord asked him, "Simon, do you love Me?" When Peter said that he did, the Lord said, "Feed My lambs" (21:15). When you love the Lord, there is an outflow of life to feed others, to minister Christ as life to others. We may say that we are enjoying the Lord, but our mind has not been changed, our will has not been subdued, and our emotion has not been touched by the Lord or stirred up by Him. We surely need the drinking, eating, abiding, and breathing, but we also need our soul dealt with. The enjoyment of the Lord requires us to have a change in our mind, to have our will subdued, and to have our emotion stirred up to love the Lord.</P><P>The Lord Jesus went on to touch Peter's strong will, but He did it in a wise way. He did not rebuke Peter and tell him that his will was strong and stubborn and that some day his will would be subdued. Instead the Lord said, "When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go" (v. 18). This shows the ripening of life, the maturity in life, not merely the growth in life.</P><P>The more mature you become, the more submissive you are. When you are young, you are stubborn in your will, and it is so easy for you to debate and argue with others. But if you are growing in the Lord, the day will come when you will be very submissive. When you are ripe in the life of Christ, you will never argue with the brothers. You will go along with others. Even if they put you on the cross, you will say, "Amen." To go along with a fellow member needs the growth in life and the ripening in life, the maturity in life.</P>
