   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Theocratic Government</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Churches in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The theocratic government in the churches in the New Testament is through the Spirit who dwells in the spirits of the apostles and the elders, both of whom are the New Testament priests, with the revelation of the New Testament teaching Acts 15:6, 23, 28; 2:42; 1 Thes 5:12; 1 Tim 3:2; 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Urim and Thummim on the breastplate of the high priest in the Old Testament typify the unveiling Spirit, the Holy Spirit, indwelling our receiving spirit, our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two spirits mingled together are today s Urim and Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever the apostles and the elders as the New Testament priests come to the Lord and wait on Him for His administration in the church, they will surely receive some light and some word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this way we have God s speaking in the administration of the church to carry out His theocratic government.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This theocratic government is also through the coordination of the New Testament prophets Acts 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a local church there should always be some prophets to strengthen our inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the New Testament theocratic government for God s administration in the church to carry out His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we need to consider the practical application of this fellowship in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever the elders of a local church come to the Lord, they come as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because they bear the responsibility of the eldership, they want to know how to take the lead, how to teach, how to shepherd, how to oversee, and how to be patterns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, they have to pray together, to wait on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As they pray and fellowship, the indwelling Spirit will speak and enlighten them inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In their regenerated spirit, they will receive something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then they will realize how the Lord wants them to take the lead, to shepherd, to oversee, and to be patterns.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because this may not be so adequate or strong, there are the prophets in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The prophets speaking strengthens the elders understanding of the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The functioning of the elders and the prophets in this way constitutes a kind of government for the administration of God in His church to fulfill His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s theocratic government in the churches in the New Testament is according to the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God indwelling the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the leading ones go to the Lord to seek His leading, they receive some inner understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the prophets prophesy, what they say strengthens the feeling of the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The result of this divine coordination of the New Testament priests and prophets in the Body of Christ is the God-commanded blessing Psa 133:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that all of us can now have a clear view concerning the New Testament leadership, including the headship of Christ, the leadership in the church life, the leadership in the ministry, and God s government in the administration of the churches.</S>
