   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX A PRACTICAL EXERCISE OF PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE LORD S TABLE MEETING 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we consider these exercises for the meetings as something too difficult and not worthwhile, there is nothing further to say.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we think that these exercises are worthwhile, we should apply ourselves, spend our time, and learn to put ourselves aside particularly in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Otherwise, these exercises will only be in letter; there will not be much spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are not willing to pay the price, what we are doing can be compared to building a castle in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, if we are willing to pay the price, we must diligently apply ourselves to be exercised in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of exercise will yield no result if we do not have the heart for it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, if we want good and rich meetings, we must allow the Holy Spirit to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Holy Spirit cannot come out in a meeting unless He can first come out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we must allow Him to reign in us by simply laying ourselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>PRAYER IN THE LORD S TABLE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Usually, at the beginning of the table meeting everyone feels quite ordinary; we do not have any particular feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In such a case we can select Hymns, #158, Lord, Thy love has sought and found us / Wand ring in this desert wide; / Thou hast thrown Thine arms around us, / For us suffered, bled, and died.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>/ Sing, my soul!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He lov d thee, / Jesus gave Himself for me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This hymn can easily touch the feeling deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, it gives us a sense of the Lord s coming to seek us and His giving Himself up for us; on the other hand, it stirs up a sense of gratitude in our hearts and a desire to offer up our praise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are touched in our spirit after singing and have entered into the feeling of the Lord s seeking us and giving Himself up for us, a brother should offer a prayer according to this feeling in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE PRINCIPLE OF PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>IN A LORD S TABLE MEETING Fitly Connected to One Another</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must pay attention to a few principles when we pray at a table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, our prayers must be fitly connected to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After singing a hymn that was selected according to the spirit of the meeting, we should utter a prayer to follow the hymn; we should not pray in a disconnected way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should sense the feeling of a meeting by following the Spirit s moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a meeting we should be like those in a relay race in which we may not run outside the lane.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After singing the first hymn, someone should follow with a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the first prayer, someone else should follow with a second hymn or a second prayer, and perhaps there should be a third prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The entire meeting, including the selection of hymns, prayers, reading of Scriptures, exhortation, or testimony, should be carried out as if we are in a relay race; there should not be another beginning halfway through the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The present situation in our meetings is that we have one beginning after another, with each person making his own move.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Five people have five different activities; ten people have ten different activities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From the beginning to the end, our meetings are continually being restarted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, the entire meeting is disconnected, without a distinct beginning, progression, or conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a serious mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must firmly grasp this principle: with the exception of the beginning prayer, all subsequent prayers, whether it is one prayer or ten prayers, must be connected with each other and closely follow each other.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moving Forward in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, our prayers should move forward; they should not remain in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Immediately after we offer a prayer in relation to a hymn, we must move forward in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must not only move further but also move higher.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For instance, when we follow Hymns, #158 with a prayer, our spirit must not remain in the same place; it should move forward.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Horizontally, our prayer should advance further; vertically, it should climb higher.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first prayer leads to the subject; hence, the second prayer should climb one step higher, and then when another hymn is selected, it should climb even higher.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must hold on to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as in writing a composition, we keep moving higher and further.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Maintaining the Feeling of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Third, as we move forward in the meeting, we must learn to maintain the feeling of the meeting in our prayers and hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This simply means that we cannot proceed independently.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we move forward in selecting a hymn, and especially when we pray, we should bring the brothers and sisters with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we pray, the more they will say Amen; the more we pray, the more they will be drawn to the center.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The brothers and sisters may not be uplifted in their spirit before we pray, but after we pray, their spirits should climb higher and higher.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose the brothers and sisters are in the feeling of the Lord s suffering, yet our prayer is concerning the Lord s glorification in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our feeling does not match the feeling of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to our feeling we have already climbed up to heaven, but the brothers and sisters are still prostrate on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to take care of the feeling of the brothers and sisters as we move upward.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, prayer requires a great deal of exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In a three-legged race, we must take care of our partner who is bound to us; we cannot simply run as fast as we wish.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Likewise, as we move forward in a meeting, we must bring the brothers and sisters with us and run with them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not disregard this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This requires a considerable amount of exercise.</S>
