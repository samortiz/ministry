   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT FOLLOWING DIVISIVE ONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The last issue is found in 3 John 9-10: "I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether Diotrephes was a real Christian I do not know, but he was one who loved to have the first place in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was one who dominated the church in which he was, rejecting the apostles and some good saints and even casting out of the church those who received these saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may think he is an extreme case, but the same thing is still existing today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is the cause of division?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is mainly because of the rivalry for the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"I want to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I will not be under you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I am not number one, I will set up another group so that I can be in charge."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one, of course, will openly make such a declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He will wear a beautiful cloak and hide behind it if accused of causing division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But as a church, full of life, we can see through his outward pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, we reject both antichrist and Diotrephes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we refuse to follow self-appointed leaders, there will not be any division.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is our only Head.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These, then, are the seven issues that result from the seven mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, there will be the growth that brings in the distinctions in life between the little ones, the young ones, and the fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, there will be a strong testimony of victory over the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, the church will rise up out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fourth, Satan will not dare to touch the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fifth, we shall keep ourselves from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sixth, we shall have nothing to do with antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Seventh, we shall not give a following to divisive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These issues are the outcome of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They cannot be brought about by regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They result from our being in the reality of the seven mysteries: life; fellowship; abiding; the anointing; the divine birth; the divine seed; and the water, the blood, and the Spirit.</S>
