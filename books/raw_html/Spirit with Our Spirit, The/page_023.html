<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. As the Holy Spirit to Seal the Believers of Christ</H2><P>In the New Testament, we see the compound anointing Spirit operating as the Holy Spirit to seal the believers of Christ (Eph. 1:13; 4:30b; 2 Cor. 1:22a). To seal means to anoint. When a person puts his seal on something, that sealing is the anointing. The Spirit is a living seal that saturates us with the divine element. We have to pray, "Lord, don't just seal me once, but saturate me all the time. I need Your sealing; I need Your saturating." When we live by the Spirit, we have the sense that something within us is saturating us, and that saturating is the continuous sealing. This sealing dispenses the divine element of the processed Triune God into the believers and saturates them with it. It also transforms the believers into the inheritance of God (Eph. 1:11). It is remarkable that we sinners can be transformed to such an extent that we are considered by God as His inheritance. How could we, the constitution of sin, be God's inheritance? Surely, this implies transformation.</P><P>Our being God's inheritance, as spoken of in Ephesians 1:11, is related to Christ's redemption (v. 7). We were lost in sin, but Christ's redemption brought us out of sin and unto God. Then we became persons in Christ. Christ has become our sphere and our realm in which His element is always saturating us, and that saturating is the Spirit's sealing to transform us into God's treasure. Today, in Christ, God considers us as His treasure to become His inheritance. The life-giving Spirit anoints us, seals us, saturates us, with the divine element. This saturating is the dispensing, and the dispensing is transforming us, making us the treasure of God. If we walk in the Spirit every day, even every moment, we are under this sealing, this saturating, to transform us into a treasure for God's inheritance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. As the Sealing Spirit<br>to Be a Pledge to the Believers</H2><P>The sealing Spirit becomes a pledge to the believers (Eph. 1:14; 2 Cor. 1:22b), guaranteeing God as the inheritance of the believers and giving the believers a foretaste of God as their heritage. We are God's inheritance, and God is our inheritance. For us to be God's inheritance, we need the sealing. For us to have God as our inheritance, we need the pledging. In ancient times the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchasing of land. The seller gave the purchaser some soil from the land as a sample. Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, is also a sample. The Holy Spirit is a sample of what we will inherit of God in full.</P>
