TYPIFYING CHRIST</h2><h2 class="head2">A. As the Embodiment of God&rsquo;s Testimony</h2><p>The ark, the incense altar, the showbread table, and the lampstand are all types of Christ. Christ has many aspects, and these four items show forth different aspects of Him. As a type of Christ, the ark typifies Christ as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony. Christ is the embodiment of God. The ark as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony typifies Christ as the embodiment of God. All that God is, is embodied in Christ. Colossians 2:9 says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. Our use of the word embodiment is based on this verse. Because God is embodied in Christ, He is portrayed, defined, and explained by Christ. Christ is God&rsquo;s definition, His explanation. As God&rsquo;s testimony, Christ is typified by the ark of the testimony.</p><p>In Colossians 2:9 we have a clear statement saying that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. With the ark of the testimony we have a picture, a type, which corresponds to this direct statement. In teaching children to read, a teacher often shows a picture of an object with the word identifying it underneath. For example, there may be a picture of an airplane, and underneath the picture the word &ldquo;airplane.&rdquo; In the Bible we have both pictures and words. Concerning Christ as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony, we have the word in Colossians 2:9 and the picture of the ark in the book of Exodus.</p><h2 class="head2">B. For God&rsquo;s Redeemed People<br />to Contact Him and Enjoy Him</h2><p>God is in Christ. Apart from Christ we cannot meet God. Not only is God in Christ, but Christ Himself actually is God. John 1:1 says that the Word, which is Christ, was with God and was God. In Romans 9:5 Paul says that Christ is God blessed forever. Jesus, a carpenter from Nazareth, was the very God over all and blessed forever. The only way for us to contact God and enjoy Him is through Christ and in Christ. The ark as a type of Christ indicates that God&rsquo;s redeemed people can contact God and enjoy God in Christ and through Christ.</p><p>Because the Jews do not contact God in Christ, they do not have genuine contact with God, and they certainly do not enjoy God, even though they may worship Him. It is doubtful that today&rsquo;s Jews even have the concept of enjoying God. Instead, they emphasize fearing God, worshipping God, exalting God, and adoring God. They may wonder how we can speak of contacting God and enjoying Him. But the New Testament reveals that God has come in Christ that we may contact Him, receive Him, and enjoy Him. As the ark of the testimony, Christ is for us to contact God and enjoy God.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE CENTER OF THE TABERNACLE<br />OF TESTIMONY</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Signifying the Center<br />of God&rsquo;s Dwelling Place</h2><p>If we look at a diagram of the tabernacle, we may wonder how it is possible to say that the ark of the testimony is the center of the tabernacle of testimony (38:21). But in the Bible it is the inmost part of something which is regarded as the center. For example, although our heart is not located at the exact center of our body, we nonetheless regard it as being in the center. Likewise, because the Holy of Holies is in the inmost part of the tabernacle, it is the center of the tabernacle. It is the focus of the tabernacle and signifies the center of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. God dwelt in the tabernacle, but not in the outer court or in the Holy Place. He dwelt in the Holy of Holies. The ark in the Holy of Holies signifies the center of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the church (Eph. 2:21-22).</p><p>The cover of the ark is equal to the throne of grace in Hebrews 4:16. It was upon the cover of the ark, the throne of grace, that God dwelt. This was the exact place where God was. In the Old Testament this place was in the tabernacle of the testimony. But in the New Testament this place is in the church. The church today is God&rsquo;s tabernacle, His dwelling place.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Signifying the Contents of the House of God</h2><p>The ark also signifies the contents of the church as the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15-16). Just as the ark as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony was the content of the tabernacle, so Christ as the embodiment of God is the content of the church. Many Christians argue over who is the church today. Some may ask, &ldquo;Why do you say that you are the church? Are we not the church also?&rdquo; When this question is raised, our inward feeling may be, &ldquo;You claim to be the church. But what is your content? Do you have Christ as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony?&rdquo;</p><p>Inwardly the church must have Christ as the content in reality and not merely in terminology. Outwardly the church must be on the proper ground, the ground of oneness. This ground is also the ground of locality. Any ground other than the ground of locality is not the ground of oneness. The church in Jerusalem was built on the ground of the locality of Jerusalem. Hence, it was established on the ground of oneness. Among Christians today there are so-called churches built on many different grounds, such as the ground of presbytery, immersion, or certain teachings. All these grounds are divisive, the basis for division. They are not the unique and genuine ground of oneness.</p><p>If we would be the church, we must comply with both the outward prerequisite and the inward prerequisite. The outward prerequisite is the ground of oneness, and the inward prerequisite is Christ as the contents, as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony. If we claim to be the church, we must have Christ not merely in terminology, but in reality as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s living testimony. Certain groups of Christians are actually societies, not churches, because their content is something other than Christ Himself. The church is the Body of Christ with Christ as life and everything. The content of the church is Christ as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_280.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_282.html">Next</a> </body></html>
