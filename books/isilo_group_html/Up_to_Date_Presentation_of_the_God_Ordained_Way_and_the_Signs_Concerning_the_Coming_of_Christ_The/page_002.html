First, we have the Lord's name. The Lord said that whenever we are gathered into His name, He is in our midst (Matt. 18:20). Therefore, whenever we come together, we should believe that the Lord is with us. His name is our enjoyment. Second, we have the Lord's Spirit. The Lord's Spirit is with us all the time and everywhere, but when we meet together, the Lord's Spirit is doubly present with us. Third, we have the Lord's word. Whenever we meet, we have the Lord's speaking to us. Furthermore, these three things&#151;the Lord's name, the Lord's Spirit, and the Lord's word&#151;are the Lord Himself. When we draw a deep breath by calling, "O Lord Jesus," we feel refreshed in our body and clear in our heart. This is neither a superstition nor something of our imagination; it is God Himself coming into us to be our supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INFLUENCE<br>OF TRADITIONAL CHRISTIANITY</H2><P>I would like to tell you a little about our history. Up to the present time, the Lord's recovery has been among us for almost seventy years. The first meeting was started in 1922 in Foochow by Brother Watchman Nee and others. Brother Nee was the first to bring in the Lord's recovery, whereas I was the one who raised up the first church among us in the north, in my hometown, Chefoo, in 1932. Brother Nee and I both came out from the background of Christianity. Brother Nee's grandfather was a pastor, and my mother was a third generation Christian. We were alike in that we were born in Christianity, we grew up in Christianity, and we were educated in Christianity. Therefore, it was not easy for us to escape the influence of Christianity. At that time we were still young. It was an unstable time&#151;the country was segmented by the warlords, the government was corrupt, and the people were suffering. Seeing the international situation and considering the future of the country, many young people really desired to do something. At that time the Lord did a particular work in China and raised up a number of young people who loved the Lord and who lived for the Lord. They were all our age. However, after a time most of them did not take the way of the Lord's recovery. By the Lord's mercy, we remained. We surely saw the revelation of the Lord and knew the deviation of Christianity. Therefore, we determined to have only three things&#151;the Bible, the Lord's name, and salvation; the rest we could do without.</P><P>Although we had made such a determination, there was still the question of how we should meet. From our childhood we had not seen any kind of meeting outside Christianity; we had already seen enough of the whole order of things in Christianity. Therefore, when we desired to meet, naturally it was difficult for us to be rid of the "color" of the denominations. I can still remember that when I was twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, a meeting was raised up in my mother's home, and I took the lead there. Although I had not studied in a seminary, nor had I been a pastor or a preacher, I had to give a message and lead the prayer. Therefore, the way of meeting in Christianity was spontaneously brought over to our meetings. In October of 1933, after I gave up my job, I went to Shanghai to see Brother Nee, and I stayed there. I very much appreciated some of the things that I noticed in the way they met that we did not practice in the north. However, for the most part, their way was about the same as ours: someone led the meeting, someone gave a message, someone concluded the meeting, and all the rest listened to the message. It was always like this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF PRAYING OVER THE HYMNS, PRAY-READING THE LORD'S WORD,<br>CALLING ON THE LORD'S NAME, AND<br>SPEAKING THE HYMNS TO ONE ANOTHER</H2><P>In 1949 I was sent to work abroad, first to Taiwan, and the next year to the Philippines. Probably in 1953 or 1954, we began to practice praying over the hymns; that is, after singing a hymn, the brothers and sisters would utter some prayers according to the hymn. Everybody felt that this was very enjoyable, and as a result everyone became living. Ten years later, I went to the United States. Then in 1966 I returned to Taiwan, and it was at that time that the saints in Tainan began to practice pray-reading, joining the reading of the Word with prayer, that is, not only reading but also praying. Because of this, many saints were released, and the situation became very flourishing. This practice spread rapidly to San Francisco, and when the saints there received it, they too were benefited. Thus, we have the praying over the hymns and the pray-reading of the Lord's Word. One time, before the Lord's Day morning meeting, while everyone was sitting quietly and waiting, as was our custom, I stood up and said, "Everyone who came to the meeting can say four words." As I was speaking, I still did not know what the four words were. While I was speaking, I was considering. Then I spoke the following four words: "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" Everyone practiced this on the spot, and some immediately composed some songs concerning it. Then this became prevailing. I knew that this was the Lord's leading. So at that point we added another item&#151;calling on the Lord's name. At that time we were meeting in Elden Hall in Los Angeles. Many saints had moved to the neighborhood of the meeting hall. In the early evening, one could hear the voices of the saints calling, "O Lord Jesus!" Everyone was calling&#151;calling in the homes, calling on the streets, and calling in the meeting hall. That fervent situation lasted for a considerable time. In 1968 I was invited to Jakarta, Indonesia. In a meeting there, I spoke concerning Ephesians 5:19, which says that we can speak to one another in psalms. Out of this came the speaking of the hymns one to another. As a result, the meetings became even more living than before.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Up-to-Date Presentation of the God-Ordained Way and the Signs Concerning the Coming of Christ &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
