<h2 class="head7">A Living That Brings the Heavenly Rule<br />
to the Earth for the Fulfillment<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is a living that brings the heavenly rule to the earth for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (Matt. 6:10). In ancient times, the Jewish people wore a long gown with a blue band encircling the bottom, signifying that their conduct (typified by the garment) was under the rule of the heavens (signified by the band of blue) and reminding them to keep God&rsquo;s commandments (Num. 15:38-39). Today, as we live under the heavenly ruling, the heavenly rule is brought down to the earth. This rule is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is to build up the organic Body of Christ. The Lord&rsquo;s goal, the Lord&rsquo;s purpose, in saving sinners, dealing with us, disciplining us, and operating in us is the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In our going to visit people and baptize them, in our speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word to others, in our praying for certain ones who are on our heart, everything should be for the building up of the Body of Christ. If we are not under the heavenly rule of the kingdom of the heavens, it will be very difficult for us to have any capacity to participate in the building up of the organic Body of Christ. The more we are under the heavenly rule of the kingdom of the heavens, the more capacity we have. Then whatever we do, whatever we are, whatever we say, however we act, and wherever we go will be for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is for the purpose of fulfilling God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The kingdom is for the church. Matthew 16:18 says, &ldquo;I will build My church,&rdquo; and verse 19 says, &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; One verse concerns the building up of the church, and the other verse concerns the establishing of the kingdom. If the church is not built up, there can be no establishing of the kingdom. The building up of the church is for the kingdom, and whatever the kingdom is, is for the building up of the church. In the two verses quoted above, the church and the kingdom are mentioned interchangeably, indicating that the church and the kingdom are closely related to one another. In a sense, the church is for the kingdom, and in a deeper sense, the kingdom is for the church.</p>
<p>If there is no kingdom rule in a local church, there will be no building up of the Body in that locality. If there is quarreling, debating, murmuring, and reasoning in a local church, there can be no rule of the heavens in that church. In that case, the building up of the church will be annulled. If those in that locality would live a life that brings the heavenly rule to the earth, then God&rsquo;s New Testament economy will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head7">Beginning with the Formation<br />
of the Church on the Day of Pentecost</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens had its beginning with the formation of the church on the day of Pentecost (Matt. 16:18-19). Before the day of Pentecost, there was no reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Appearance of the Kingdom of the Heavens,<br />
as Revealed by the Lord&rsquo;s Parables<br />
on the Seashore in Matthew 13</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s sermon revealing the reality of the kingdom of the heavens was given on a mountain in Matthew 5&mdash;7, whereas the Lord&rsquo;s parables revealing the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens were spoken on the seashore in Matthew 13. In typology, a mountain signifies elevation, which corresponds to the heavenly nature of the kingdom, and the sea signifies the corrupted world under Satan. This indicates that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is higher than the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head7">As the Tares (the Nominal Christians)<br />
Growing Together with the Wheat (the Real Believers)</h2>
<p>According to Matthew 13, there are three things that denote the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The first of these is the tares, signifying the nominal Christians, growing together with the wheat, the real believers (Matt. 13:24, 30). The nominal Christians are those who have the name of a Christian but do not have the reality in life. The tares were not sown among the wheat by the Lord, but by the Lord&rsquo;s enemy, Satan (Matt. 13:25, 28). Tares bear the appearance of wheat but do not have the life of wheat. Similarly, the nominal Christians do not have the life of God. When I was young, I read an article describing the appearance of the tares. As the tares grow they appear to be identical to the wheat. They can be differentiated from the wheat only at the point that the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow, but that of the tares is black. Actually, what the tares produce is not fruit at all (Matt. 13:26). Once the fruit comes forth, it is obvious to everyone which are the wheat and which are the tares. This is why it is often difficult to discern whether a person is a nominal Christian or a real believer.</p>
