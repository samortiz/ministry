<h2 class="head1">VI. GOING AWAY TO ARABIA<br />AWAY FROM OTHER CHRISTIANS<br />AND RETURNING TO DAMASCUS</h2><p>In verse 17 Paul says that he &ldquo;went away to Arabia.&rdquo; It is difficult to trace where in Arabia Paul went and how long he stayed there after his conversion. However, it must have been a place away from other Christians, and the time of his stay there must not have been short. His purpose in saying this was to testify that he did not receive the gospel from man. In Arabia he must have received some revelation concerning the gospel directly from the Lord.</p><p>By going to Arabia, Paul went to a place apart from both Jewish culture and Christian influence. According to traditional understanding, Paul stayed in Arabia for three years. Actually, we do not know how long he remained there. We simply know that for a period of time he went apart from Jewish religion and Christian influence. During his stay in Arabia, he probably compared his experience with the Old Testament, which he had come to know so well through the instruction of Gamaliel. I believe that in Arabia Paul had a quiet, sober time of checking his experience with the Old Testament Scriptures. No doubt, he also spent much time in prayer.</p><p>Here we see another principle for us to follow. After we have a certain amount of experience directly from the Lord, we need to withdraw from every kind of religious influence to quietly and soberly check our experiences with the Bible. This will be a great help to us. I believe that as Paul was comparing his experience with Scripture, much light and revelation came to him.</p><p>In verse 17 Paul also says that he &ldquo;again returned to Damascus.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">VII. AFTER THREE YEARS GOING UP TO JERUSALEM<br />TO SEE CEPHAS AND JAMES</h2><p>In verses 18 and 19 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the brother of the Lord.&rdquo; Three years after his return to Damascus, Paul went up to Jerusalem. I believe that during these years he also spent much time in prayer and in checking his experience with the Old Testament.</p><p>Although Paul did not confer with flesh and blood, at a certain time he did go up to Jerusalem. To confer with flesh and blood is wrong. However, to isolate ourselves from other members of the Body of Christ is also wrong. After receiving revelation, at the proper time we need to contact those members of the Lord&rsquo;s Body who came to know the Lord ahead of us. There is the need for this kind of fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. GOING TO SYRIA AND CILICIA<br />OF THE GENTILE WORLD</h2><p>In verse 21 Paul continues, &ldquo;Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.&rdquo; Arabia, Syria, and Cilicia were all regions of the Gentile world. By mentioning his journeying to all these places, Paul testifies that the revelation he received concerning the gospel was not from any men, any Christians, most of whom at that time were in Judea (v. 22). I believe that in the regions of Syria and Cilicia Paul spent more time praying and considering the Scriptures. Probably he also received further revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. UNKNOWN BY FACE TO THE CHURCHES OF JUDEA</h2><p>Verse 22 says, &ldquo;Yet I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which are in Christ.&rdquo; To say this is also to strengthen the point that Paul did not receive the gospel from any who were believers in Christ before him. Hardly any of the saints in Judea had seen him.</p><h2 class="head1">X. THE CHURCHES IN JUDEA<br />HEARING THAT THE FORMER PERSECUTOR<br />NOW PREACHES THE FAITH WHICH ONCE HE RAVAGED</h2><p>In verses 23 and 24 Paul concludes, &ldquo;But they only heard that he who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which formerly he ravaged. And they glorified God in me.&rdquo; The churches, including all the believers in Christ in Judea, only heard the news of Paul&rsquo;s conversion and glorified God in him. They had nothing to do with his receiving of the revelation concerning the gospel.</p>
