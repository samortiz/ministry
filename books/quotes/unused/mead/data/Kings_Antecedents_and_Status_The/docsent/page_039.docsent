   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Myrrh signifies death and also the fragrance of death.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among the human race, death has no fragrance; however, with Jesus there was the fragrance of death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the wise men presented the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh, I do not believe they knew the meaning of the gifts they offered.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They surely offered their gifts under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They presented gold, frankincense, and myrrh, signifying that the child Jesus had the divine nature; that His life would be a life of resurrection, full of the fragrance of frankincense; and that His life would be full of the fragrance of death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Jesus was twelve years old, He went to Jerusalem with His parents Luke 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because He was burdened to see what people were doing in His Father's house, the temple, He stayed in Jerusalem after the feast Luke 2:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mary and Joseph did not understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They looked for Him and eventually found Him in the temple vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>44-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a sense, Mary rebuked Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I had been Jesus, I would have rebuked her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would have fought back and said, "Don't you know what I'm doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why do you come to bother Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we read Luke's account, we shall see that Jesus did say something to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" v. 49 . After He said this, He went along with them and returned with them to Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was a real killing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His intention was killed, and in that killing we can smell myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was not the fragrance of frankincense; it was the sweet aroma of myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we read the four Gospels, the biographies of Jesus, we shall see that in the life of Jesus the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh were very prevalent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was always living the resurrection life, and He was constantly under the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He did not wait until thirty-three and a half years had passed before He went to the cross to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Throughout His whole life He was continually being crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, He had not only the fragrance of resurrection, but also the sweet myrrh of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The wise men found the kingly child Jesus in Bethlehem, which Micah 5:2 tells us is "little among the thousands of Judah."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was born in such a humble town in such lowly circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, due to the vision that came through the star, the wise men paid their full respect to the kingly child, not caring about the place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, they offered to Him the three precious items.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each of these items signifies some precious element of the Lord Jesus' nature and life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In nearly every page of the four Gospels, we see the preciousness of the Lord's humanity, the fragrance of His resurrection life, and the sweet aroma of His sacrificial death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even in the early days, soon after the Lord's birth, the wise men did such an appropriate thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It exactly suited the Lord's nature and life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their offering was certainly presented under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It may be that these precious treasures offered by the magi provided for the Lord's trip from Judea to Egypt and from Egypt to Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The worship and offering of the wise men truly accomplished something.</S>
