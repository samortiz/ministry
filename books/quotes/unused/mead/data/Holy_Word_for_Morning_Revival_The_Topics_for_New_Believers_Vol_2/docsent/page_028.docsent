   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The most crucial matter in God s full, all-inclusive salvation is His making us a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>156 According to 2 Corinthians 5:17, in God s eyes we are a new creation already.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in our experience we are not yet fully new.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our experience there is a process.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>157 It takes a long time in our life and it requires us to contact God, to receive God, and to get God added into us all the day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It requires us to pray, confessing our sins and rejecting ourselves to take the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To take the cross of Christ is a killing, and this killing is death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This death brings in resurrection, and in this resurrection, the divine life in us will carry out its renewing capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>158 By this our inner man 2 Cor 4:16 ...is being metabolically renewed day by day with the supply of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>159 Thus, renewing is the divine element being dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>160</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has the best provisions to help us to receive the renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first provision is the cross, the putting to death of Jesus 2 Cor 4:7-12 ....The second provision is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Titus 3:5 speaks of the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>...We are receiving the new supply of the Spirit daily to renew us metabolically....The third provision God gave us is our mingled spirit, our human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our human spirit, the Holy Spirit dwells, works, and renews us....</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Last, the fourth provision is the holy Word.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Triune God Making a Mutual Abode</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>with the Lover of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Based upon the fact that the Spirit of God dwells within the lover of Christ John 14:17 , God the Father and the Son come to the lover of Christ and make a mutual abode with him v. 23 . John 14:23 says that if anyone loves the Son, the Father and He will come to make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means to make a mutual dwelling place for the Triune God and the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The indwelling Spirit is mentioned in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Based upon this fact, the Father and the Son come to make a mutual dwelling place with us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 14:2 the Lord said, In My Father s house are many abodes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 23 tells us how these many abodes are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is by the Spirit living in us as a foundation; then the Father and the Son come to us to make a mutual abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>162</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In our daily life the Father and the Son often come to visit us...to do a building work in us, making an abode which will be a mutual dwelling place for the Triune God and for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the building up of the Father s house through the constant visitation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>163 In this building Christ is making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>164 This making home is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This takes place first by our being strengthened with power through the Spirit into our inner man, into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then Christ has the chance to build His home in our heart so that we may be filled unto, resulting in, the fullness of the Triune God for the expression of the Triune God Eph 3:16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>165</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the divine revelation in the Bible, God is building by working Himself in Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This involves the mingling of divinity with our redeemed, resurrected, and uplifted humanity....If we see this, we will realize that all our problems today are due to one thing our shortage of having God in Christ built into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>166</S>
