<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="3">
<li>The devil&rsquo;s first stratagem in tempting the first God-man to ignore His human status of being a man&mdash;Matt. 4:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His anointing the first God-man, God declared that He was His beloved Son&mdash;Matt. 3:17.</li>
	<li>Based upon God&rsquo;s declaration that the first God-man was His beloved Son, the devil exercised his first stratagem, tempting the first God-man to ignore that He was a man.</li>
	<li>But the first God-man defeated His tempter by standing firmly in His position of a man and answering him by saying, &ldquo;Man shall not live...,&rdquo; insisting to indicate that He was a man&mdash;Matt. 4:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The devil&rsquo;s second stratagem in tempting the first God-man to assume His divinity of being the Son of God&mdash;Matt. 4:5-7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Again, it was based upon what God declared the first God-man was.</li>
	<li>The devil exercised his second stratagem, tempting the first God-man to assume His divinity by having a miracle of protection by the angels.</li>
	<li>But the first God-man overcame His subtle tempter by saying, &ldquo;You shall not test the Lord your God,&rdquo; indicating strongly that He was a man before God who should not test the Lord His God.</li>
	<li>God in His eternal economy wanted to have a man as one of His creatures to deal with His enemy Satan, another creature, but the enemy tempted the first God-man to assume His divinity as the Creator of all things. By this subtle way, Satan mixed up the levels of God as the Creator and Satan himself as a creature.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The devil&rsquo;s third stratagem in seducing the first God-man to love the glory of the kingdoms of the world, worshipping him as God and serving him as his subordinate&mdash;Matt. 4:8-11; Luke 4:5-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It should have been that in the preadamic age, God appointed the archangel to be the head of the preadamic age (Ezek. 28:13-14), and the authority and glory of the kingdoms of the earth should have been given to him. After he rebelled against God and became God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, he was judged by God (Isa. 14:12-15), but the full execution of God&rsquo;s judgment upon him will not be completed until the end of the millennium (Rev. 20:7-10). Hence, until that time he has authority over the kingdoms of the earth.</li>
	<li>In his subtle temptation of the Lord, he offered the earthly kingdoms and their glory to the first God-man as a bait to hook Him so that He would worship him as God and serve him as his subordinate.</li>
	<li>But the first God-man saw through the evil tempter&rsquo;s devilish device and conquered him by chasing him away and telling him in a shaming way that as a man before God He would worship God and serve Him only.</li>
	</ol></li>
