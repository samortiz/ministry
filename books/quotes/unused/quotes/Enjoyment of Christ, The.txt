Following the eating of the meat of the Passover lamb, the children of Israel were also to eat the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs
Hymns, 187 has twenty-six stanzas which speak of all the items of Christ as our enjoyment in the Gospel of John
Eventually, John testified in the book of Revelation that this One will be the Lamb of God on the throne for eternity
We need to have meeting after meeting for many days to see all the items of God as our enjoyment from Genesis through Revelation
The Lord also said that all that the Son is and has is declared as reality to the believers through the Spirit
God is also life, power, wisdom, mercy, kindness, grace, peace, faithfulness, patience, joy, glory, and salvation
A husky American man is the fullness of America because he has eaten, digested, and assimilated all the riches of America
What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead but also the expression of the riches of what God is
A cup which contains water has the riches of water, but these riches cannot be seen until the water fills the cup to overflowing
Always keep in mind that the riches are the items as the content, and the fullness is the expression of the content
Whatever God is, dwells in Christ, but the Bible does not tell us that God is the door, the Lamb, or the offerings
With Christ we also have the element of incarnation because Christ is not only the complete God but also the perfect man
In the New Testament, Peter, John, James, and Paul experienced Christ as the door to come out of the fold of Judaism with its law
In John 109 the Lord said I am the door if anyone enters through Me he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture
Christ was the door for all the Old Testament sheep to enter into Judaism for protection, for being kept in custody
Christ then became the door to us to release us from the bondage of religion so that He could become our pasture
When someone realizes Christ as his enjoyment, he will come out through Christ as the door to enjoy Christ as the pasture
In chapter three He is the brass serpent and the bridegroom , and in chapter four He is the spring of living water
Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheepgate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes
In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water
When Jesus saw this one lying there and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition He said to him Do you want to get well
The items in this portion of the Word-the holy city, the holy temple, the feast, the Sabbath, the angels, and Moses- form a religion
At the end of such a feast, Christ cried out the promise of the rivers of living water, which satisfy man's expectation for eternity
Clay signifies humanity and the spittle as something proceeding out of the Lords mouth signifies the Lords words which are spirit and life
The Lord's making clay of the spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord's living word, which is the Spirit
By the anointing of the mingling of the Lord's word with our humanity, our eyes, which were blinded by Satan, can have sight
He was also the Lamb of God, offered on the altar, which signifies the cross, in the outer court of the tabernacle
We need to notice that in the Gospel of John, the first item of Christ is the Word and the last item is the breath of life
In John 6:63 the Lord said that it is the Spirit who gives life and the words which He speaks are spirit and life
If we are going to enjoy all the items of the riches of Christ, we must know how to deal with the Word and the Spirit
The Word, through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, has become the Spirit who is indwelling our spirit
John not only shows us how God in Christ as the Spirit becomes our enjoyment but also tells us the organ we need to enjoy this One
John 7:38 says that out from the innermost being of the one who drinks of Christ will flow rivers of living water
John 12:25 says, 'He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life'
The spirit has to be regenerated and exercised to contact the Lord, but the soul has to be lost, that is, to be denied
As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection
He spent three and a half years to reveal Himself to His disciples, but at that time they could not inwardly experience and realize Him
God uses different kinds of things to keep, to protect, and to hold His chosen people until they get to know Christ
The unique way for us to enjoy the Lord is to deny our soul and take care of the inner sense within our spirit, our innermost part
Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
Galatians 4:6 says, 'And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
Romans 5:5 says that 'the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us'
Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ is making His home in our hearts, and 2 Corinthians 4:6 says that God is the One who shines in our hearts
We can say that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit but we cannot say that he who is joined to the Lord is one heart
We receive the spiritual things of God by our spirit as an organ and enjoy all these spiritual things by the heart
We cannot enjoy Him until we love Him with our heart and give Him the ground to take over all the parts of our heart
We have to realize that Christ as the Spirit is given to us as the foretaste, as the firstfruits, for our enjoyment
We have to exercise our spirit to receive Him, to absorb Him, and we also have to exercise our heart to love Him
Many have received the Lord into their spirit, but not many have the enjoyment of Christ, because their heart is not for Him
We must learn to contact and receive Him by exercising our spirit and to love, treasure, appreciate, and seek Him by exercising our heart
He said Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God
If we are rich in spirit, that means we are filled up and do not have the capacity to receive the Lord in a fresh way
Even though we know not for what we should pray, the Spirit intercedes within us and for us, many times with unutterable groanings
If we do not know how to deal with the Word in a proper way, in the way of life, we can never enjoy Christ adequately
In praying we work together with Christ, giving Him the ground and the opportunity to work out something through us
Even while we are driving our car or cooking in the kitchen we can breathe by calling from deep within, 'O Lord'
Christ is in us and we need to have the prayer as the censer, the bowls, the container, for the indwelling Christ as the incense
If we are not at peace concerning our personal needs, we can remind the Lord to feed us and care for us according to His Word
Do not pray according to what you think you have to pray, but ask the Lord what He wants you to pray in your prayer
Verse 16 says, 'And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way'
Verses 22 and 23 say, 'And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord
The Lord reveals His heart to us, we know His intention, and His intention becomes our burden, which returns to the Lord as our intercession
The Lord's desired intention in His heart was to save Lot from Sodom, but the Lord needed someone to pray for Lot
We should ask, 'When we ended our prayer and said amen, did we end our speaking or did the Lord end His speaking'?
We should open ourselves to the Lord, look to Him, and seek His face to behold Him, adore Him, worship Him, praise Him, and thank Him
