   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ASCENDED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But the Lord Jesus not only asked a question.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He went on to quote Psalm 110, verse 1, where God is recorded as saying to Christ, "Sit thou on my right hand, till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is abundantly clear that this refers to the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Don't care for any religion, don't be concerned that much with politics, don't labor so much over the so-called Christian faith, and don't pay so much attention to scriptural interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must all concentrate upon Christ as the exalted and ascended One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ascension of the Lord Jesus is the climax of all that He is, of all that He has done, and of all that He will do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consider the chart on the opposite page.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then He was incarnated; He passed through human life on this earth; He was put into death, buried, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He passed through all these things and ascended to the peak of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After His ascension, He came down in another way with another form.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He descended not only as the Spirit of life, but also as the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As such a One He is building the church and preparing it as His Bride for His second coming, at which time He will usher in the millennium, the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And one day He with all He has accomplished and gained will be in eternity as God and the Lamb with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord in Matthew 22:41-45 is referring not only to Himself as a person, but as a person in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the ascended One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this passage He is at the climax, the peak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the ascended One, He includes everything from eternity past to His ascension and everything from His ascension to eternity in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hallelujah for such an ascended Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today's Christians talk much about being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then they are always complaining how poor or how weak they are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A few, on the other hand, say that by God's mercy they are not so weak, but indeed rather spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But my burden is that we must be rescued from all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Forget about all these religious problems, politics, the so-called faith, and even the interpretation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You talk so much regarding how to interpret and understand the Bible, but Jesus would ask, "What think ye of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a proper answer to all problems, but the main problem is, What think ye of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you ever turned yourself from the Bible to the living, ascended Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christians today pay so much attention to all other things, but nearly all neglect a continual living relationship with the living person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not principally, for example, a matter of whether you as a sister should wear a short or a long skirt.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The vital point is what you think of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is absolutely a matter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Don't measure your skirt by the length, but by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It must be a skirt of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever you speak about clothing, do not judge it by measurement, color, or style, but by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The best way to interpret the Bible is by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The best way to care for the faith is by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have Christ, surely you will have the proper faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you lack the living Christ, regardless of the creed you have, that is not the faith, that is a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must care for nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must even forget our Bible if we take it as a Bible without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to forget our kind of faith the sound, fundamental, scriptural faith if it is a faith without a living touch with the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord's intention is that we care only for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus in answering all these ridiculous and foolish questions did not forget the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have already seen how He referred to the building of God, that is, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In His answer to all these questions He brings the questioners back to the matter of Himself and His church.</S>
