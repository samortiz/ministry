   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PECULIARITY BEING ANTICHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point I would like to give a name to your peculiarity, and that name is antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Your peculiarity and my peculiarity is named antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Very few Christians realize that the terrible antichrist is our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually speaking, today Christ doesn t have much position and authority on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The whole earth is antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No doubt all the unbelievers are antichrist, but even we the believers who are the lovers of Christ have within us an antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Something is within usurping and occupying us so that Christ has no position.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ does not have much ground within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ground within us for Christ is subtly and hiddenly possessed altogether by our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PECULIARITY AND SPIRITUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to my observations, the Christians who have the strongest peculiarity are those who are the most spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times the common lovers of Christ do not have such a strong peculiarity, but those who are top spiritual persons have a very strong peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do everything spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have spirituality, but they don t give much ground to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They live, walk, and behave in their spirituality, not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their spirituality occupies their being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of this no one can condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their peculiarity is not in the world, in the self, or in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather it is in their spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You could only see their spirituality; you could not see their peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, their spirituality is their peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In pretense it is spirituality, but in actuality it is peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a sense if you are not peculiar, you can never be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times spirituality is a cloak for peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One thing makes me fearful: as I read the biographies of many spiritual people, I realize a number of them did not have a good ending.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of them had a good beginning and a good process, but not a good ending of their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because their hidden peculiarity became the real issue in their life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their spirituality which actually was their peculiarity, caused them to end their lives not in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The older we become the more peculiar we are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am concerned that as I get older and older, I will become more peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I fear lest my peculiarity hide itself under the cloak of spirituality and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This has happened to a number of spiritual persons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are touching a very crucial thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why I call peculiarity within us antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From reading many biographies you can discover a principle: some of the lives in these biographies end with that person s peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peculiarity became the very issue of their life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that something is within all of us that can be called antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It occupies us and will not let us give Christ an inch of ground.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our inner being, our hidden being, is fully usurped by this antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is such a subtle thing because it usurps us, yet it pretends to be for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many times it pretends to be for Christ under the cloak of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually it is neither Christ nor spirituality, but just us in our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is one of the crucial killing factors within our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I call it antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is in us, and it is difficult for us to name.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are short of a proper vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not have the adequate words to express something concerning our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is just peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can we pin down our peculiarity?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How can we discern that such a thing within us is antichrist?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>LIVING CHRIST IN A DAILY WAY</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First of all, you should not believe that your daily life is really a life that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At least you are not living Christ all the time in a daily way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must admit this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I surely admit this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During the past weeks my confession to the Lord has been mainly that I didn t live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all must admit that we don t have a daily life that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may declare, To me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 , but we cannot testify of such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to our experience we would have to say that to us to live is something else, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Others around you may not be so clear, but you yourself know where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You know that you don t live Christ much in your daily life.</S>
