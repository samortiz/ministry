   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE HIGH PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But now there is the need of someone to cook the groceries to be the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A single man needs a house, he needs groceries, and he also needs a wife to cook his groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to realize that Christ as the High Priest is the cook.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to learn of Him how to cook.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let Christ take the lead in cooking, and you just follow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is our tabernacle, Christ is the offerings as our food, and Christ is also our Priest preparing the food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose you have the tabernacle and all the offerings, but no priest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means you don t have a cook.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is like having a house with all the groceries, but no cook.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am afraid that many Christians today are in a situation where they have just one broken corner of the tabernacle with nearly no offerings and no priests to cook the food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are used to worshipping God in that broken corner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are not used to worshipping God with a complete, perfect, and erected tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are not used to having so many items of the offerings to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nor are they, as proper priests, used to preparing the food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Need of Practice</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Over the past years I have bought a number of pianos, but I have never learned to play a piano in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I like to play the piano in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, we all like to worship God in our natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is so easy for us to have a natural way to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We bring our hymnal and sit on the chairs and sing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seems too difficult for us to offer Christ as the trespass offering, as the sin offering, as the burnt offering, and all the other offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seems too difficult to labor on Christ and then to bring Christ to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We like to depend upon others to be our priests.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We let them pray in the meetings for us so that we don t need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once when I was in the San Francisco Bay area a gentleman told me that today is the Twentieth Century, and that everything is specialized.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said that if you would teach the Bible or you would teach people to sing, you must go to a seminary to study and become a specialist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The others are busy with their jobs or with their studies so they have no time to learn these things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sunday should be the day they can relax and let the seminary specialists do their work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said we should not ask the common believers to offer a prayer because they have never learned to do this properly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of concept is the natural way and this is the prevailing practice among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing Natural in the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you look at the tabernacle you can see that the entire situation is not natural.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To know how to act in the realm of the outer court, you have to drop your natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have to learn how to kill the sacrifices and how to take care of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have to know how to take care of the breasts and the shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to know what to do with the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have to know how to enter into the Holy Place where you handle the showbread table and where you dress the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With every point there is a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you don t act and behave and move according to the regulation, right away you would die.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The two sons of Aaron died this way Lev 10:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nothing natural and no natural way is allowed in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nearly all of the Christian services today are full of natural ways and natural activities.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why there is such poverty among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The riches are in the Bible, but they have been neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE PEACE OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we come to the central and the most meaningful offering, the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the other offerings are for this offering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the center and the focus of all the other offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The peace offering is at the very center of these offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Burnt Offering Being for the Sin Offering</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In spiritual experiences the burnt offering is for the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If Christ had never been absolute for God, He could never have been our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His qualification to be our sin offering was His absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to the clear word in Hebrews 10:9 and according to the prophecies in Psalm 40, He was a Person who lived His life absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every part of His being, His every breath, and every drop of His blood, were altogether absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because of this He was qualified to be our sin offering to deal with our sin and to take away our sins which we inherited by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not a shallow thing; this is not an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It needs One who lived a life absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>So the sin offering is supported by the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The burnt offering is the backing of the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why in the record of these five offerings sometimes the sin offering could become the burnt offering Lev 5:7,10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ as our sin offering is supported by Himself as our burnt offering, as One who lived a life so absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The burnt offering is the backing, the support, the base of the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without the burnt offering, there is no sin offering.</S>
