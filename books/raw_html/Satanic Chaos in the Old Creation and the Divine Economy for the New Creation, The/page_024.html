<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. One of Christ's Followers Betraying Christ,<br>Another Denying Him Three Times,<br>and the Rest, as Sheep, Being Scattered</H2><P>One of Christ's followers, Judas, betrayed Christ (Luke 22:21-23, 47-48). Another of His followers, Peter, denied Him three times under Satan's sifting (Luke 22:31-34, 54-62). Eventually, the rest, as sheep, were scattered (Matt. 26:31), and the Lord Jesus was left alone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Jews Collaborating with the Roman Government<br>to Sentence Christ to Death and Crucify Him</H2><P>The Jews collaborated with the Roman government to sentence Christ to death and crucify Him (Luke 23:1-43). That certainly was something of the satanic chaos, but eventually the outcome of that chaos was something very good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Divine Economy<br>in Christ's Crucifixion, Resurrection,<br>and Ascension</H2><P>Now we need to see the divine economy in Christ's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. God Judging Christ on the Cross<br>for the Sin of the World<br>and for the Sin of the Believers,<br>and Christ Dying an All-inclusive Vicarious Death</H2><P>A great part of God's economy was Christ's death on the cross. God judged Christ on the cross for the sin of the world and for the sin of the believers (John 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:3). Christ died an all-inclusive vicarious death (John 19:34; 12:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Women Followers of Christ<br>Watching His Crucifixion</H2><P>The women followers of Christ watched His crucifixion (Matt. 27:55-56). This indicates that in loving the Lord Jesus the sisters are stronger than the brothers and are ahead of the brothers. Whereas Peter and the other disciples forsook the Lord, the women followed Him from Gethsemane and eventually watched His crucifixion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Joseph, One Expecting the Kingdom of God,<br>and the Women Followers of Christ<br>Burying Christ in an Excellent Way</H2><P>Joseph, one expecting the kingdom of God, had a high position in society and was a hidden disciple. He and the women followers of Christ buried Christ in an excellent way (Luke 23:50-56; Matt. 27:57-61). Christ was not born in an excellent way, and He did not die in an excellent way. However, His burial was excellent and according to the highest standard.</P>
