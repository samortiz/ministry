   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PASSIVITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The reason "heathens" and fleshly believers are demon-possessed is mainly due to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the reason some consecrated believers are demon-possessed can be stated in one word, "passivity."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meaning of passivity is that the will no longer actively rules and directs a person's spirit, soul, body, or any part; consequently, he does not use his will to choose and decide everything that is related to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being passive is the opposite of being active.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are two aspects to the passivity of the believers: 1 losing self-control this means one cannot control his entire being or a part of it; 2 losing freedom this means one cannot make decisions that would coincide with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For a believer to be passive means that he does not use his various faculties, and that he allows his faculties to fall into a state of passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Though he has a mouth, he does not speak; rather, he wants the Holy Spirit to speak through his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Though he has hands, he does not use them; rather, he wants God to use his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is unwilling to move any part of his being; he wants God to move them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He thinks that he is totally consecrated to God and that he no longer needs to use any part of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way he falls into passivity and allows evil spirits to deceive him and attach themselves to the passive members of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many believers accept what we spoke about in the last chapter concerning the union with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, they are misled to think that such a union with God, such a comprehension of His heart's desire and such a denial of one's own intention require that they passively submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They think that their will should be nullified and that they should become like robots.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They assume that the meaning of submission to God is not using their own will anymore and not using any part of their bodies through their will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a person will no longer 1 choose, 2 decide, and 3 use his own will to act.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Outwardly, there seems to be an indication of a great victory because he used to be stubborn in his will, but suddenly he has become very submissive and is as weak as water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He does not have an opinion in anything and is completely submissive in following orders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does not use his mind or will, and he does not exercise the discernment of his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, he simply becomes a person of complete obedience whenever God moves, he would move.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this is an inducement for demon-possession.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the believer has consecrated to God this way, he naturally falls into a passive state.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He does not move at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All day long he quietly waits for an external force to move him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When there is such an external force, he moves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, he remains calm.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When this condition continues for a long time, he finds that he cannot act at the times he should be acting because there is an absence of an external coercing force.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps he even wants to move, but in the absence of an external urging force, he cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As this drags on, the believer finds that without an external force, he is not able to move even one step.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even when the will wants to move, it seems as if it is suppressed by something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He seems to have a kind of bondage around him, which restricts him from moving as he wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He must wait until an external force urges him before he moves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this circumstance, the believer thinks he is very submissive to God because he does not have any activity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But even if he desired to move, he could not do so.</S>
