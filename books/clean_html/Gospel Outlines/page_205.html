<h1 class="title">THE WRATH OF THE LAMB</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rev. 6:12-17</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Lamb is Christ
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lamb symbolizes Christ as man&rsquo;s Savior Who accomplished redemption.</li>
	<li>Whenever the Bible refers to Christ as the Lamb, it alludes to His being the Savior for the redemption of man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The tender love of the Lamb
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Whenever the Bible mentions the Lamb, there is the thought of tender love conveyed.</li>
	<li>The way Christ appears as the Lamb is also tender-loving.</li>
	<li>When Christ was being offered up for the redemption of man, He was like a lamb being led to the slaughter; He was without murmuring or hatred.</li>
	<li>When Christ bore man&rsquo;s sins on the cross, He was the Lamb full of tender love.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The wrath of the Lamb
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>While the Lamb was tender-loving for the redemption of man, Revelation 6 refers to the wrath of the Lamb.</li>
	<li>The wrath of the Lamb is not caused by man&rsquo;s sins, but by man&rsquo;s unbelief and rejection. Even though man is sinful, God is able to redeem him; but man&rsquo;s unbelief and rejection kindle God&rsquo;s wrath.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The time of the wrath of the Lamb
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The time of His wrath will be at the end of this age.</li>
	<li>There is the possibility that the age could end at any moment.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The consequence of the wrath of the Lamb
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When the Lamb is wroth, the heavens and the earth will be turned upside down and men will be struck with sudden terror and fear.</li>
	<li>All those who heard the gospel and did not believe, but rather rejected Him, will be in that calamity.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to escape the wrath of the Lamb
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Do not put off confronting God until tomorrow. Tomorrow may be the day of His wrath. Repent and believe in Him today.</li>
	<li>Today you can receive Him as the loving Lamb. Confess that He is your Savior and open your heart to Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
