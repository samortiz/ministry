   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's house, the family of God, is organic, but, in a sense, it is not as organic as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A group of Christians may be an assembly, but may not actually be the house of God because they do not live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They may say they are the Body of Christ, but actually they may not be, because they are still living in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as we live in our natural life, we are not the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I was young, I heard of two or three elders who met together to talk about matters in their so-called church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually one threw his Bible and another got up and walked out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Was that the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was not the Body, but the fallen flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your body is the greatest part of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing can be your body, but you yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Dentures are not a part of your body; they are something extra without any life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our real teeth are joined to our body, not by organization but by life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They grow organically in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A member of your body is organic; it grows in an organic union with your body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever is not in organic union with your body is foreign to it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In like manner, the Body of Christ is an organism, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A podium, for example, consists of pieces of wood organized and fitted together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A man's body, on the other hand, is not organized but organic, full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is not only the living family of God the Father, but even more a living organism of Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christianity has fallen into a state where there is organization instead of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are millions of Christians on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have been forgiven through Christ's redemption, washed by His precious blood, and regenerated by the Holy Spirit; they are children of God and members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet actually in their life and service what is seen is an organization, not an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is organic, but "anity" is not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Any kind of anity, including Christianity and even "local churchanity," is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church should be only organic, an organism full of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever you do must be from the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You are living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God living in you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not move by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Move by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not act by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Act by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes when I have intended to visit a brother, I have been held back because I realized that Christ was not going to visit that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was only I, the natural I the good I, the I with good intentions; it was altogether myself, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then I would pray, giving my position, my ground, and everything pertaining to this visit to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the Lord began to go with me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are many who love the Lord and are devoted to Him and yet who do not realize that their natural life should be put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the new man, the church, there "cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all" Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"All" denotes people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To say Christ is all means that He is you, He is me, and He is everyone else in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To say Christ is in all means that He is in everyone in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The new man, the church, is not Chinese Japanese, French, English, German, or American.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The new man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, when we act as those who are Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, American, British, German, French or Italian, we are no longer the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the new man there is no Jew and no Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually in the new man there cannot be any Jew or Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There cannot be any Chinese or any Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the new man there cannot be any white or any black.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you still want to be black or white, you are through with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we must act in our spirit, totally repudiating our natural life.</S>
