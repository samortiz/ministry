   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STRENGTH THE APPEARANCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At Moreh God reappeared to Abraham and he met God again 12:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you say that you have been called, I would ask you this question: What is the seal of your calling?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The seal of our calling is God's reappearance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's reappearance, His coming again to us, is the seal of our answer to His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reappearing of God to Abraham was the strength that enabled him to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you read the record in Genesis, you will see that during Abraham's time mankind lived in the way of building a strong city for their protection and erecting a high tower for making themselves a name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That was the living of the humankind at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But Abraham lived in an absolutely different way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His living was an anti-testimony to the way of the humankind, to the way that had been fully developed at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we saw in message thirty-six, at Babel there was a great city built by man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This city was not built with God-created stones but with man-made bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those bricks were made by killing the element in the soil that grows life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Abraham, the called one, did not live in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With Abraham, there was no city and no tower.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After God's reappearing as the seal to Abraham's answer to God's calling, Abraham immediately built an altar, not to make a name for himself but to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why did Abraham do this?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because he had the reappearing of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How was he able to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Also because he had the reappearing of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Remember that the record in Genesis concerning Abraham is a biography, not a doctrine, religion, or tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham did not build an altar because of teaching or religious tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He built it because God had reappeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's reappearing meant everything to him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It not only sealed Abraham's answer to God's calling; it also strengthened him to live in a way that was absolutely different from the way of all of the humankind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It caused him to live as an anti-testimony to his generation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The altar that Abraham built was an anti-testimony to the tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>AFTER ARRIVING AT CANAAN Now we need to find out at what time Abraham experienced God's reappearing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our God never does anything without a purpose and He never acts in a meaningless way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything He does is purposeful and meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After Abraham answered God's calling, believing in Him and obeying Him, he came to the oak of Moreh 12:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he came to that place, God reappeared to him because he had believed in God's calling and had obeyed it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As one who believed and obeyed God's calling, Abraham had no choice of the place where he should stay.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God called Abraham a second time at Haran, and he crossed the river there, beginning a long journey.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While he was on this long journey, he did not have his own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hebrews 11:8 tells us that Abraham did not know where he was going.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had no road map in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His road map was a living Person, the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While he was journeying, he had to look to God continually; he could not stop at any place he chose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As he was traveling, God's presence was his direction, his road map.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He followed God in this way until he arrived at Moreh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At Moreh, God appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That appearing of God at Moreh indicated that Abraham had come to the place where God wanted him to be.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There God told Abraham that He would give that land to his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's first appearing to us does not depend upon us at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is God who initiates that calling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, after the initial appearing, every other appearing depends upon our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although God's first appearing is initiated by Him and does not depend upon us, the subsequent appearings depend upon our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If Abraham had not arrived at Moreh, he would not have had God's reappearing, the reappearing that strengthened him to go on with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This going on with God was Abraham's living by faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>AFTER THE SEPARATION OF LOT A second reappearing of God to Abraham is recorded in Genesis 13:14-17.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this chapter we see that Abraham had difficulty with Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the flesh, Lot was Abraham's nephew, but before God he was Abraham's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although Lot gave Abraham a difficult time, Abraham did not strive with him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, he allowed Lot to have the choice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After Lot had separated from Abraham, leaving him alone, God reappeared to Abraham again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This reappearing was due to the fact that Abraham did not strive or fight for himself but left all the choices with his brother Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This second reappearing of God also strengthened Abraham's life by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After we have been called by God, we need to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is our need today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you have been called by God, you have to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Bible, faith is in contrast to sight.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you have been called by God, you must live by faith, not by sight.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Look at today's world: it is undoubtedly a harvest of the human living sown at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A seed was sown at Babel, and the world today is a great harvest of that seed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>People are building great cities for their living and are erecting high towers for their name.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the situation everywhere on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But we have been called.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What does it mean to live by faith?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It means to live by trusting in God for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Abraham did not declare that he lived by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Neither did he preach living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He simply lived by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now we need to see in what way Abraham lived by faith.</S>
