   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, I would like to call your attention to a few terms that are used in Ephesians to describe the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is the Body of Christ 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is also the new man 2:15 and the dwelling place, or habitation, of God 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church has at least these three functions: to be the Body of Christ, to be the new man, and to be the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is not merely a gathering of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not just a congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is something organic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every person needs a body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is a great person; thus, He needs a great Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is so great that He fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He fills the whole universe, including all the galaxies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is great to such an extent that He becomes the dimensions of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe is just Christ Eph 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such an unlimited and immeasurable Christ needs a Body, and this Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, this Body is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are parts of this Body in England, in Brazil, in Iceland, in China, in Mongolia, in India, in Tibet, and in all other parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all are the organic members of this vast Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is its function in relation to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, the church is also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is its function in relation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this whole universe, God is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is working for the accomplishing of His great economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word economy means a household administration or plan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has a great household plan, and God's household, which is the Body of Christ, is unlimitedly great.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In God's household plan, the entire universe is a large room in which God's household lives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to carry out His eternal plan, which is the economy of the ages, God needs a man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He does not need more than one man; He needs only one man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This one man is the new man.</S>
