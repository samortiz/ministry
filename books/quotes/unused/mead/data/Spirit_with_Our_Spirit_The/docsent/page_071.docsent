   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to the teaching of the New Testament, God's salvation is altogether hinged on sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We saw in the previous message that sanctification is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy and that this line begins from the seeking Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit's seeking us out is the initial work of the sanctifying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is through sanctification that God carries out His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God made an economy according to His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After He made this economy, He worked to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this economy God purposely chose us to be holy, predestinating us unto sonship Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's choosing is to make us holy unto sonship, to make us holy to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God wanted man to be sanctified unto His sonship, and He carries this out through His sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After His choosing, God created the universe with man as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But after His creation man became fallen, and God applied His anticipated redemption in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then in the New Testament time, God came to be incarnated as a man, and this man is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God became a man to be our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Luke 15 first tells us that the shepherd came vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That indicates God's incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Shepherd came through the way of God becoming a man, so this shepherd is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God not only became a man to shepherd us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Luke 15 He is also the seeking woman, the woman who has lost a coin vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Out of one hundred sheep, one became lost, so the shepherd went out to find it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The lost sheep which the shepherd went out to find was the lost coin which the woman sought.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, He is a God-man as the Shepherd to die for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, He is the woman, the Holy Spirit, to find the lost coin in a fine way by lighting a lamp and sweeping the house.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This signifies the Spirit enlightening our heart and searching and cleansing our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, the lost coin was found by this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ, in His first aspect, is the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ in His second aspect, is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His incarnation He became the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His resurrection He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is this Spirit who comes to find us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The salvation of God begins with this finding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This finding is the initial sanctifying work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sanctifying work of the Spirit continues in us until we are glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, sanctification by the Triune God is the holding line of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is also the holding line of our spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our first experience in our salvation was the seeking sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The prodigal son in Luke 15 came to himself and repented because the seeking woman, typifying the Spirit, enlightened him and found him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>17-20a .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our repentance came from the finding of the Spirit, and the finding of the Spirit is the Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The finding of the Spirit was the cause, and our repentance was the result.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our final experience of sanctification will be our glorification, the transfiguration and redemption of our vile body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are redeemed first in our spirit, then in our soul, and finally in our body Rom 8:23b .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The redemption of our body is the full sonship of God.</S>
