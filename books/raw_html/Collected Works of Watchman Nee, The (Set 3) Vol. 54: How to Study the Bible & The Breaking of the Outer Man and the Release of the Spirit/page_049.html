<p>After we have agreed on the above principles, we can group the difficult passages in the Bible together. For example, there are "the sons of God" in Genesis 6:2, "go down alive into Sheol" in Numbers 16:30, "An old man is coming up....Saul knew that it was Samuel" in 1 Samuel 28:14, "Concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even...the Son" in Matthew 24:36, the two swords in Luke 22:38, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them" in John 20:23, "renew themselves again unto repentance" in Hebrews 6:6, "There no longer remains a sacrifice...for sins" in Hebrews 10:26, "The spirits in prison" in 1 Peter 3:19, and "The gospel was announced also to those who are now dead" in 1 Peter 4:6. All of these can be considered problematic passages for interpretation. Other issues such as the camel passing through the eye of a needle in Matthew 19:24 have been settled over four hundred years ago already; they no longer can be considered problematic. Paul's journey to Jerusalem in Acts 21 is also not a problem in interpretation; it is a problem related to his own action.</p><p>Following the above principles, let us deal with one specific passage in the Old Testament that poses difficulty.</p><p>Genesis 6 speaks of the sons of God. This relates quite much to the second coming of the Lord Jesus, because the Lord said, "Even as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man" (Luke 17:26). What were the days of Noah like? At that time the sons of God married the daughters of men. Many Bible expositors think that this refers to the sons of Seth marrying the daughters of Cain. Many popular versions of the Bible also interpret it this way, but this is too farfetched. When the sons of God married the daughters of men, the offspring were called nephilim. (The King James Version translated it as giants. The original meaning of the word is "fallen ones.") How could Seth's sons marry Cain's daughters and bring forth nephilim? Seth was a man. So was Cain. How could their offspring be something other than ordinary humans? This interpretation is too farfetched.</p><p>Who were these sons of God? We have to look for the answer elsewhere in the Old Testament. If we look, we will find evidence that the sons of God refer to the angels. Job gives us strong proof of this. Job was written before Genesis. It is commonly acknowledged that Genesis was written at the time of Moses, while Job was written at the time of Abraham. Later books often use the terminology of earlier books. In Job 1, 2, and 38, the sons of God refer to the angels. Hence, the sons of God in Genesis 6 must refer to the angels. The Lord Jesus said, "For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven" (Matt. 22:30). This does not mean that angels are incapable of marrying; it merely means that they do not marry. God forbids angels from marrying, because they are spirits. But in Genesis 3 the greatest confusion in the world occurred: the spirit of Satan entered into a lower animal&mdash;a snake. Therefore, in Genesis 3 we see a union of spirit with a lower animal. By Genesis 6 the spirits had joined themselves to men. Angels should not marry, but they married the daughters of men. The result was the nephilim. When the nephilim were produced, God had to destroy them. God wanted to have angels and men, but He did not want nephilim. He did not produce such a race. God created everything "after its kind." Yet the demons came and joined themselves to men. The result was nephilim in the world. God had to judge this severely. God later destroyed the Anakim because they were nephilim as well. Originally, the nephilim were annihilated during the flood. But in Canaan they were found again. This is the reason they had to be destroyed. God would not allow such creatures to remain on earth.</p><p>Jude 6 speaks of some angels who "did not keep their own principality but abandoned their own dwelling place." This refers to the angels who married the daughters of men. When 2 Peter 2:4 speaks of angels who sinned, it refers to the same thing.</p><p>The English translation of Genesis 6:3 is very clear: "And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh." The Hebrew text is clearer than the Chinese translation which drops the word also. In the original language the verse reads, "He also is flesh." What does also mean? It means another one. Suppose we say, "You eat, and I eat also." The word also means that there is a second one who is eating. When God said that man also was flesh, He meant that something else already was flesh. What other creatures could be compared with human beings? Only the angels. For man to also become flesh meant that the angels already were flesh. With such proof, we can say with confidence that the sons of God refer to the angels.</p>
