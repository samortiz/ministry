To Desolate Arabia</H2><P>Isaiah 21:13-17 reveals that Jehovah would desolate Arabia by the harshness of battle because of its warlikeness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. To Trample Down the City of Jerusalem</H2><P>Even Jerusalem was included in Jehovah's judgment upon the nations. In His judgment He would trample down the city of Jerusalem&#151;the valley of vision (22:5-7)&#151;because of its unforgivable iniquity: it did not look to the Lord and did not regard Him (vv. 11b-14). God's chosen people should have regarded Him and respected Him. They refused to do this, and their failure in this matter was unforgivable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. To Destroy Tyre</H2><P>Finally, these chapters reveal that Jehovah's judgment was to destroy Tyre by the Assyrians (23:1, 13-14) because of its pride of all beauty (glory) and all its honored men (v. 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE ISSUE OF THE JUDGMENT<br>OF JEHOVAH UPON THE NATIONS</H2><P>Now we need to see the issue of the judgment of Jehovah upon the nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Unveiling Satan's Kingdom<br>of Darkness behind the Nations<br>and His Oneness with the Powers of the Nations</H2><P>The first issue of Jehovah's judgment is to unveil Satan's kingdom of darkness (Eph. 6:12b; cf. Dan. 10:13, 20) behind the nations and his oneness with the powers of the nations, such as Nebuchadnezzar as a figure of Satan (Isa. 14:12-15), whom Isaiah regards as one with Satan. According to Daniel 10, there is a prince, a fallen angel, an evil spirit, over every nation. These fallen angels are part of Satan's kingdom of darkness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Showing Jehovah's Sovereign<br>and Just Rule over the Nations</H2><P>Jehovah's judgment upon the nations shows His sovereign and just rule over the nations (13:17; 14:22, 24-25; 19:1). This rule is seen particularly during times of crisis and war; for example, this rule is seen in Hitler's decision during the Second World War to invade Russia instead of England. In His sovereignty, the Lord rules over the nations. For this reason, the Lord Jesus is called "the Ruler of the kings of the earth" (Rev. 1:5).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
