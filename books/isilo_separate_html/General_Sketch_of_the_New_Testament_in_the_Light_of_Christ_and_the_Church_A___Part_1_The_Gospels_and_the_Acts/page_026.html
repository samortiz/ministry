At that time the Lord Jesus was able only to be among the disciples; He was not able to enter into them. Therefore, the Lord needed to die and resurrect, and in so doing, He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit, who is a wonderful person (1 Cor. 15:45b). After His resurrection, the Lord still had a physical body, yet it was wonderful and mysterious. On the day of resurrection, He came to the disciples in this extraordinary way, not only to be with the disciples but also to enter into them as breath. He breathed into them and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:22). Just as the Father sent the Son, the Lord was also in the disciples and one with them to send them.<p>After His death and resurrection, the Lord Himself is not only in the Father but also in the disciples. Since the disciples are in the Lord, and the Lord is in the disciples, they are automatically in the Father. Therefore, where the Lord is, there the disciples are also. In this way the Lord brought them into God. Now everything has been accomplished. God is in man, and man is in God, so God and man become a mutual abode. God becomes our abode, and we become God&#8217;s abode mutually. For this reason, John 15 continues with the Lord&#8217;s word to abide in Him and He in us. This is the proper meaning of this portion of John.<h2 class=head2>Being in the Father but Going to the Father</h2><p>On the one hand, John 14:10 tells us that the Lord is in the Father, while on the other hand, the Lord needed to go to the Father (vv. 12, 28). When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, according to His divinity, His inward essence, He was already in the Father. However, He also had another part, another nature, which is His humanity, which had not yet been transfigured to be in the Father. Therefore, He had to pass through death and resurrection. By passing through death and resurrection, His humanity was transfigured and brought into His divinity.<h2 class=head1>KNOWING THE BASIC THOUGHT OF THIS GOSPEL AND OF THE ENTIRE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>In order to understand the Gospel of John we must be very careful. We should not understand this portion of the Word by our human concept. This is a mistake made by so many Christian teachers. We have pointed out, for example, that many Christians teach that John 14 speaks about going to heaven, but this is inconsistent with the context of the entire Gospel of John. The context of this entire book tells us that first God was incarnated to be a m an, and then He brought man into Himself by the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. Our intention in stressing this matter is not merely to adjust and correct the wrong teachings in Christianity. It is to see something subjective in life. We must realize that it is not the Lord&#8217;s intention to prepare a place for us in the heavens and then one day to bring us there. This is not the thought of God. The thought of God today is to work Himself into us. We must realize how much we need to be wrought into God and have Christ wrought into us. May we all be clear that this is the basic thought of this Gospel and the basic thought of the entire New Testament.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
