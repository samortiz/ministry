   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STREAM OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From this picture of the stream in the Scriptures, we may realize that it is also a stream of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Consider the situation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the whole city there is only one street, and in the midst of that street is the stream of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By contemplating this scene we realize that this stream is the stream of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It flows throughout the entire city, and the whole city can only have fellowship through or by this stream of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This reveals that the fellowship of the Body of Christ is the stream of divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wherever the stream of the divine life flows, there is the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the fellowship of the Church?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is the flowing of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the stream of the divine life flows within us, there is the fellowship of the Body among us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This fellowship started from the day of Pentecost, and from Jerusalem it flowed to Antioch, to Asia, to Europe, and then to America and throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fellowship of the Body which we are enjoying is such a tremendous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are in this stream of the fellowship of the Body, and this flowing is ever increasing and being enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more it flows, the greater and the richer it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE STREAM OF TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Where this stream flows, there is also the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How do we know that this is so?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Consider again the situation of the New Jerusalem and suppose that you are one who is coming into the city from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you enter the gate, you immediately come upon the one street of the city in which is flowing the stream of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you follow the stream, it will bring you to the place where the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that the stream will bring you into contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, this stream of living water will cause you to know something of Christ; it will testify to you something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where could you find Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where could you meet Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here is the channel; here is the way; here is the means by which you can touch Christ, by which you can experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, therefore, is with the very stream of divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Where the stream of the divine life flows, there is the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we must ask, What does it testify?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The answer is most significant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It testifies that there is a Lamb, that within the Lamb is God Himself, and that this Lamb is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the redeeming One; He is the Lamb of God Who was slain for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was crucified on the cross, shedding His blood for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After accomplishing redemption, He was resurrected and exalted to the heavens, to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Lamb on the throne is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These three items are the summary of the testimony of the Lord Jesus the Lamb on the throne with God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The stream of the divine life brings this testimony to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is the testimony of the Lord Jesus.</S>
