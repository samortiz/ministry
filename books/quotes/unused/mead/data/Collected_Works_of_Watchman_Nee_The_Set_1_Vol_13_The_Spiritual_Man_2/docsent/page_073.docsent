   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When a believer is willing to forsake all his own desires, he gains a life of real rest.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past he had many desires, exhausting all of his wits, strength, schemes, devices, and methods to gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, his heart was often confused.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When he pursued his desires, he was anxious and troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When he failed, he was worried and irritable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can he have rest?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Believers who have not forsaken their own desires and completely submitted to God feel sad about changing human relationships, the unpredictable condition of their environments, the adversities in their life, their loneliness, and many other outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of sorrowful feeling is commonly found in believers who are strong in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Desire can also arouse wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the believer becomes vexed, anxious, and angry because many outward things are not agreeable or in accordance with his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To him they are unfair and unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These different expressions of the emotion are caused by people's treatment of him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Pleasant feelings can easily be disturbed, provoked, and hurt by others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The natural desire of a believer yearns for man's love, respect, sympathy, and intimacy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he cannot obtain these, he murmurs and complains.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But who can avoid sorrowful things?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is there anyone living in this bitter world who can fully realize his desires?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, an emotional believer does not have a life of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only when a believer completely walks by the spirit, not seeking the pleasure of his desire and being content with what God has granted, can he have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" Matt 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word "souls" especially refers to the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus knows the trials His people pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just as the Father dealt with the Lord, He knows how the heavenly Father will cause the believers to be lonely, misunderstood, and neglected by man v. 27 . He knows that the heavenly Father will allow many unpleasant things to fall upon the believers so that they may be weaned from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He also knows how the souls of the believers feel in the fire of the furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, He said that we should learn from Him so that our emotion may find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was meek; He did not care how people treated Him but joyfully endured contradictions from sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was lowly; He humbled Himself willingly and had no ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ambitious ones are troubled, angered, and restless when they cannot attain what they desire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord lived in this world meekly and humbly so His emotion never boiled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said that we need to learn from Him, and that we should be as meek and lowly as He.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said that we need to take His yoke upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the restriction borne by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord also took His yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He took the yoke of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was satisfied with God's will alone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as God knew Him, it did not matter if others were against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was willing to accept the restrictions given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He said we need to take His yoke, accept His restraint, and walk according to His will alone, not seeking after the freedom of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then our emotion will not be bothered and troubled by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the believer is willing to receive the cross of the Lord and fully submit to Him, he will see that the emotion will not be disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is nothing less than a satisfied life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The believer desires nothing else because he has obtained the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is fully satisfied with the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God Himself has filled his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He considers all that God has given him, arranged for him, required of him, and commanded him is good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is satisfied if he can follow God's will and does not seek after his own desire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He had many wild desires before, but he has learned how to die to his own desire and be satisfied with God's will alone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, he does not seek after what he likes, not because he forces himself, but because the will of God has filled him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is satisfied and has no other seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This kind of living can only be expressed fully by the word satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The characteristic of spiritual living is satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not self-satisfaction or self-sufficiency, nor is it to consider oneself to be in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The meaning of satisfaction is that the believer has obtained all that he needs in God that is, in God's will , and he considers God's will as the best.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, he is satisfied and desires no more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Emotional believers have many desires because they do not consider that God has arranged the best.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, they desire to gain more, become higher, bigger, and happier, have more glory, and be more prominent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once the Holy Spirit has worked deeply through the cross, a believer no longer loves anything according to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His desires are filled by God; hence, he desires nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At this stage, the believer's desire is fully renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This does not mean that he never fails after this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His desire has been united with God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At this moment, not only does the believer not resist the Lord negatively, but he delights in what the Lord delights in positively.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He does not compel himself to suppress his own desires; rather, he delights in what God requires of him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He delights in God's delights.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If God wants him to suffer, he asks God to make him suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He feels this kind of suffering is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If it pleases God for him to be wounded, he joyously uses his hands to inflict wounds on himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He delights in the affliction more than in healing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If God wants him to be lowly, he is happy to cooperate with God and humble himself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He only likes what God likes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He does not seek anything apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Unless God exalts him, he does not wish to be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He does not resist God; he welcomes all of God's doings whether they are bitter or sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The cross produces fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All crucifixions will gain the fruit of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All those who are willing to accept the practical cross that God has given them will find themselves living a spiritual life without mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have to practice taking the cross every day according to God's desire for us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Every cross has its particular mission to fulfill as part of God's work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May we not allow any cross to come upon us in vain.</S>
