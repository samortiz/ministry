   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COOPERATING WITH THE INSTALLED LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 3 and 4 God has passed through the processes so that there can be an issue that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To cooperate with this law is to walk according to spirit and to walk according to spirit is the way to cooperate with this working law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law has been installed, but the law s function and the law s operation needs your cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And your cooperation is just to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>HAVING OUR BEING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we come to the burden of this message.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a special word in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 4 speaks of walking according to flesh, but in verse 5 the word walk is changed to the word are those who are according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Have you ever noticed the change in these two words?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have to realize that you may walk according to spirit and yet not be according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, in Greek the word walk really means to have your being, but in English walk may be different from being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In English you may walk one way and be another way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in the Bible to walk is to be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Walking is your being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So verse 4 says we walk according to spirit, and verse 5 says we are according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not just some doings or some activities according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It means the entire being is according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You don t need to pray that much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You need to see a view that the law is working within you, and this law is nothing less than the Triune God who, after being processed, is indwelling your being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need to have a clear view about this law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then you simply need to be a person who is according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why do we need to be according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because this law who is the Triune God and who is the indwelling Spirit is a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only is He a Spirit, but He as the Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These two spirits are together in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So we must be people who are according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a sense you need to forget about praying concerning your besetting sins and your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You just need to be according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You need to be a person who is according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You need to be a person who not only walks according to spirit, but who is according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if you are not doing anything as far as walking, you are still according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means you are a person, a being, according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you are such a person according to spirit, what do you need?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Surely you need nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you are according to the spirit, this law works spontaneously because you are according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes before doing something we would practice something that is not so perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We would check whether this is according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before writing a letter or before buying something, we might check: Is this according to spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kind of practice is not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we should check whether or not we all the day are according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You must realize that to be according to the spirit is much more than to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may be able to say that your reading of a newspaper or your shopping or your writing of some letters is according to spirit, but probably you cannot say that your being, your entire being, is according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times after doing things according to the spirit, we would take a vacation for a few hours.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later, when we start to do something we are reminded that we should do everything according to spirit, and then we come back to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A little while later we may take a second vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every day we have too many vacations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may do this thing according to spirit, and we may do that thing according to spirit, but we ourselves are not according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our doings may be according to spirit, but our being is not.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all must look unto the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lord, have mercy upon me!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Just have mercy upon me!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Lord, through Your mercy I ve been brought into such a desperate state.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I m here, Lord, and I m desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Have mercy upon me that I may have the grace to practice this one thing that my entire being would be according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Lord, grace me that my being may be according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I don t want just to do things according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I want to have my being, my entire being, according to the spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To have our being according to the spirit is the genuine walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Otherwise, our walking according to the spirit is not so genuine, not so perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must have our being according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we are according to spirit, the law, that is, God Himself, works within us spontaneously, freeing us from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It frees us from the law of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I encourage you to bring this matter to the Lord, and ask Him to show you the view of these few verses at the beginning of Romans 8.</S>
