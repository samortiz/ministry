   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING UNPRECEDENTED IN HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The move of God in man was unprecedented in history.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the time of God's incarnation in Matthew 1, there was not such a thing in history as God's move in man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Before Incarnation God Moving</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only with Men and among Men</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Old Testament has thirty-nine books.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most of these books are very long with many stories of God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a move God had with men and among men in the Old Testament!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He created all the things in the heavens and on the earth, what a move that was!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What a move it was when He created man!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then from Genesis 3 to Malachi there are many stories of God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But whatever God did in the Old Testament was just with men and among men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He never did anything by being in man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He never moved in man in the Old Testament.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God Moving Mainly in Man</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Beginning from His incarnation, God moved mainly in man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Testament whatever God did was mainly in man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The small preposition in may be considered as the greatest word in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you take this preposition away, the New Testament becomes empty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is like taking the switch away from an electrical appliance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the switch, it will not work, because the electricity cannot flow into it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The phrase in Christ is repeated frequently in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we were not in Christ and Christ were not in us, there would be no Christian life or church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>II.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God moved in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then God moved in the books of Joshua, Judges, and Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then He moved to a certain extent with all the kings of Israel and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But that was not God's direct move to carry out His eternal economy for Christ and the church.</S>
