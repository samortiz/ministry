   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Central Line of the Divine Revelation God's economy is His household administration 1 Tim 1:4: The Greek word for economy means "household law," implying distribution; it denotes a household management, a household administration, a household government, and, derivatively, a dispensation, a plan, or an economy for ad-ministration distribution ; hence, it is also a household economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's economy is His household economy, His household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see a vision of God's economy Eph 1:10: God's economy is His plan to dispense Himself into His chosen, predestinated, and redeemed people as their life, their life supply, and their everything to produce, constitute, and build up the organic Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's economy is to make man the same as He is in life and nature but not in His Godhead and to make Himself one with man and man one with Him, thus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression, that all His divine attributes may be expressed in human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's economy is related to His good pleasure, will, counsel, and purpose Eph 1:5, 9, 11; 3:11; Rev 4:11: God's good pleasure is what God likes, what pleases Him.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's counsel is His resolution consummated in the council of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's purpose is His intent beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's will is according to His good pleasure; God's purpose is based on His will with its counsel; and God's economy is His planned administration to carry out His purpose.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Galatians, the most basic book with respect to God's economy, is unique in its revelation of God's economy: God's economy is God Himself in His Divine Trinity becoming the life-giving Spirit to be life and everything to us for our enjoyment, so that He and we may be one to express Him for eternity 3:14, 28.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A basic item of God's New Testament economy is that "I" be crucified in Christ's death and that Christ live in us in His resurrection 2:20.</S>
