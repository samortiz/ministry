   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO REPORT ON THE WORK 2 CO-WORKERS' MEETING 27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:3:00 p.m., The Lord's Day, May 2, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ARRANGEMENTS CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE FUTURE OF THE CO-WORKERS Understanding the Meaning of Handing Over Oneself, and Having the Reality of It</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Nee: Last night there was one thing that we did not announce, which is the arrangements concerning the future of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hope that there is no misunderstanding among us concerning the purpose of handing over ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to see that we are all priests before God 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both Exodus 19 and Romans 12 tell us that everyone is a servant before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time, we see that service is not an individual matter, but a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the reason we ask all the brothers and sisters to hand over themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, there should be no need to speak about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Originally, many things could be said directly after a person believed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, due to the captivity of the church into Babylon, degradation came in, and there was the need for a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today, the church is indeed the community of saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But it is not yet the community of serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God's children do not serve, the church will merely become a "club house" of saved ones,a place where saved ones come together to sing, preach, and meet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is to change the basic nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the church has become fallen, all the brothers and sisters become free to do whatever they like and to express whatever opinion they have.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, many things become optional, and some become lawful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, no one likes to meddle with others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, we do not like others to meddle with our affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason, among God's children some barriers develop.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But God's word says that the church is the institution where men serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the place where God's children work and labor together in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church as seen from God's word is very different from the church of today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In God's word, every person, matter, and event are for serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the future, we will have to bring everyone up to this standard.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people who have become Christians today do not know what it means to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in the future, we will not have to tell the saved ones to hand over themselves; by that time, they will not be able to be a Christian if they do not hand over themselves the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a man does not forsake everything, he will not be able to step into the door.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who do not forsake everything to follow the Lord cannot be His disciples Matt 10:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Outwardly speaking, it seems difficult for a man to forsake everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But inwardly speaking, this is something that brings us joy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A man must be brought to a point where he is willing to give up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only then will he be able to follow a straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today, when we ask you to consecrate, we have to persuade you to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in the future, we will not need to persuade anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A man will either drop the world completely, or he will not be able to be baptized at all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Either you do not come, or you come in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people have said that the term "handing over" is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not arguing about terminologies today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You can call it whatever you like.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What matters is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the past, men thought that serving God was a matter of personal choice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They thought that to be zealous or not was one's own business, and to serve or not was also one's own business.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But now this is changed around.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there is the coordination, and you are in trouble, other brothers and sisters beside you will not let you fall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way, the church interferes with as well as supports every individual.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people will be there watching over you as well as helping you and protecting you.</S>
