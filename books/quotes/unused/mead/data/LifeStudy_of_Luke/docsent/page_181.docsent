   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE THE MAN-SAVIOR S GOD-MAN LIVING 2 Scripture Reading: Heb 2:14a, 16-17a; Phil 2:6-8; John 1:1, 14; 5:30; 6:38</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to consider the Man-Savior s God-man living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE MAN-SAVIOR A Genuine Man with a Real Human Nature</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Perfect Human Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>for the Qualification to Be Man s Savior</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Man-Savior is a genuine man with the real human nature and the perfect human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we use three adjectives to describe the Man-Savior in His humanity: genuine, real, and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a man, the Man-Savior is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His nature is real; that is, He was a real human being, not a phantom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, the Man-Savior s human virtues are perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to be qualified to be man s Savior, the Lord Jesus had to be a genuine man with a real human nature and the perfect human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because He is genuine as a man, real in His human nature, and perfect in His human virtues, He is qualified to be the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Complete God with the True Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and the Excellent Divine Attributes</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>to Empower and Ensure His Ability to Save Man</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Man-Savior was not only a genuine man; He was also the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the complete God, He had the true divine nature and the excellent divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Orthodox theologians and fundamental Bible teachers agree that Christ is the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, some will not admit that this One is not only the Son of God but also the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, they teach that Christ is the complete God; on the other hand, they teach that Christ is only part of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, with these theologians and teachers there is a contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you say that Christ is only part of the Trinity, then He is not the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, He is simply a part of the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The complete God is not merely the Father or merely the Spirit or merely the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The complete God is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We would emphasize the fact that the Man-Savior is both a genuine man and the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is a genuine man with the real human nature and the perfect human virtues, and He is the complete God with the true divine nature and the excellent divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have seen that with respect to His humanity the Man-Savior is genuine, real, and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we need to see that with respect to His divinity He is complete, true, and excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the complete God, He has the true divine nature, and He has the excellent divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His human virtues are perfect, but His divine attributes are excellent; His attributes are superior, surpassing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Man-Savior s divine nature and excellent divine attributes empower and ensure His ability to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His humanity there is the capacity to save us, the capacity for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But this capacity is empowered and ensured by His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His ability to save us is guaranteed by His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When some hear that the Man-Savior s divine nature and attributes empower and ensure His ability to save us, they may say, Is there any verse in the Bible that says this?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Have you read a book that teaches this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I must answer both questions with a no. Apparently, there is not a verse in the Bible that teaches this, and I have never read a book that uses these expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps you are wondering why I have the boldness to speak this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My answer is that this kind of teaching is the result of more than a half century of the study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In particular, it is the result of a ten-year Life-study of the New Testament, a study that will soon be completed with the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the divine revelation in the Scriptures, the Man-Savior s divine nature and divine attributes empower and ensure His saving ability.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible as a whole certainly reveals that the Lord s divinity empowers His saving capacity, which is in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First John 1:7 conveys the thought that the divinity of Christ empowers and ensures the saving capacity within His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse says, The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here the name Jesus denotes the Lord s humanity, which is needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title His Son denotes the Lord s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the blood of Jesus His Son indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man for redeeming God s fallen creatures with divine surety for its eternal efficacy, an efficacy that is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to 1 John 1:7, the blood shed by the Man-Savior on the cross was not only the blood of Jesus but also the blood of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was the blood of one with a dual status, the status of both man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The blood of Jesus was the genuine blood of a real man required for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The efficacy of this blood is ensured by the Man-Savior s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Divinity makes the blood of Jesus eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Apart from the Lord s divinity, His redemption could not be eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord s true divinity with His excellent attributes empowers and ensures His ability to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Humanity qualifies Him to save us, and divinity empowers Him to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His divinity also ensures His ability to save man.</S>
