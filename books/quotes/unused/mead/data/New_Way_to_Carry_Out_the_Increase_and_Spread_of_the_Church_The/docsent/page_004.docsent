   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRESENTING THE GOSPEL AND THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I want to stress one thing when you go to knock on doors, do not invite people to come to your meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You must forget about this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Also, when you go in do not talk to them too much.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may speak two sentences of greetings, and then tell them you want to present the gospel or the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You have to pray that the Lord would give you the instant utterance, speaking the same thing to present the gospel and the truth but by different utterance with different people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you talk to an older man you should use one kind of expression, and when you talk to a young lady or young boy you have to change your utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You must look to the Lord and follow His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He will give you the words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then you will find out whether your contact is saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he is saved, you do not need to repeat the gospel, but you surely have to present the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If he is not saved, you should present the gospel with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should not divide the truth from the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Again I say, do not go to people to invite them to come to your meeting, but present the truth to them and bring the meeting to their home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>USING OUR PUBLICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you begin to present the gospel and the truth you should not speak your own word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more you speak your own word, the more impact you will lose because your contacts do not know who you are or what your status is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you speak something, they may not have much confidence in it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if you present them a proper, printed book, they will be impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In general, people respect books because a book should be written with much consideration and scholarship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you present a book, they would respect it, especially when you present the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible is a famous and highly regarded book.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Mostly everyone, even the opposers, would recognize that the Bible is a great book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you present them a short portion of the Bible and say something in brief according to the notes in the Recovery Version, this will surprise and impress them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will feel that you are a person who knows the top book in this world, so this will stir up their respect and give them confidence in what you present.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you go out, you must have a Recovery Version and the rainbow booklets, which contain a slightly edited version of the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The most important publication for you to bring is the booklet entitled The Mystery of Human Life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Using this booklet is the best way to catch people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This booklet is also good for those who are saved, because so many saved ones never got to know what the mystery of human life is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you use this, you will catch them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Taiwan thousands have been brought to the Lord through this booklet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You do not need to read the whole booklet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This booklet talks about four keys to the mystery of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just use one key with those that you visit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>People respect books and they respect the Bible even more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must open up the meaning, the revelation, of the Bible to people in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then show them a note in the Recovery Version, and let them read it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will catch them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>GRASPING THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THEM</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TO PRAY AND BELIEVE IN THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Salesmen know that if they talk too much, they will lose their sale.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Basically, they impress people with their product in as little time as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the person says that their product is good, that is the time for them to close the deal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They do not talk any further.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We found out the same thing in presenting the gospel with the truth to people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we are reading from The Mystery of Human Life with someone and they respond positively, that is the time for us to lead them to pray and to get them baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the more you talk, the more the person may want you to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Most people will be polite to you since you are so polite to them, going to visit them voluntarily and showing them a book.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you ask them to read one paragraph of The Mystery of Human Life with you, they would say that it is very good after reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At least they would say that it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When they say this, you should say, Let s pray.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Don t ask, Would you pray?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you ask this, surely most of the people would say no. No one trains their little children to say no, but they spontaneously know how to say no. A knowledgeable mother would never ask the children, Would you eat this? She would tell the children to eat it, leaving them no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If she asked her children whether or not they wanted to eat something or drink something, they might say no most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, we should not ask our contact any question.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Just say, Please read this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He will be polite and may be honest enough to say that what he read was very good or good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you say, Let us pray, he will follow you to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once the word good comes out of his mouth, that is the golden opportunity to lead him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Just lead him or her to pray by repeating what you say to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His prayer may initially be something not real, but after praying two or three sentences it becomes real.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You could lead him to pray something simple such as, Lord Jesus, thank You that You died for me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord Jesus, I call on Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Lord Jesus, I love You, and I receive You as my life right now.</S>
