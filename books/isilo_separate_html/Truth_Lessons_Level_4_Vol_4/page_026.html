<p>Finally, in the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will be appointed by the Lord to rule over all the possessions of the Lord (Matt. 24:47). This is the reward that the Lord gives to His faithful slaves in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After Christ and His heavenly armies fight against Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies, the kingdom will be brought in. Then the overcoming believers will participate in the coming kingdom, which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens during the millennium. The millennium will have an earthly part and a heavenly part. The earthly part will be the kingdom of the Messiah, the tabernacle of David, the restored kingdom of Israel, and the kingdom of the Son of Man where Christ as the Son of Man, David&rsquo;s royal descendant, will be the King over the children of Israel. The heavenly part of the millennium will be the kingdom of the Father. This is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers.</p>
<p>In the heavenly part of the millennium the overcoming believers will reign with Christ over the earthly part. The overcoming believers are the righteous, the sons of the kingdom, shining forth like the sun. In the heavenly part of the millennium the Lord will drink the cup of the new covenant new with the overcoming believers.</p>
<p>In the kingdom of the Father, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcoming believers will feast with the Old Testament overcomers, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<p>The overcoming believers will inherit the kingdom as a reward. The Father delights to give the believers the kingdom, which is His promise to those who love Him and is the overcomers&rsquo; inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. The overcoming believers will participate in the coming kingdom and inherit eternal life, thereby having a fuller enjoyment of the divine life. To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded with the crown of life and to eat of the tree life in the Paradise of God. The believers who inherit eternal life will also have their names remain in the book of life. The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the crown of life, the tree of life, and the book of life indicates that in the manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy eternal life in different aspects in a fuller way. This enjoyment will be fuller than the enjoyment that we have in the church life today.</p>
<p>The overcoming believers will also gain the soul, save the soul, and enjoy the salvation of the soul. Some believers are willing to follow the Lord in this age, to suffer and be dishonored for the Lord&rsquo;s name, and to suffer in the soul and thereby lose the soul. Such believers will be saved from the realm of suffering into a realm of comfort when the Lord comes back. The Lord promised the overcoming believers that they will participate in the joy of the Lord. When Christ recovers the earth and the entire earth is under His reign, He will invite His followers, His partners, to participate in this enjoyment, to enter into His joy. In the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ. They will exercise the authority of Christ to rule over the nations; they will also be appointed by the Lord to rule over all His possessions.</p>
