<p>Some saints are afflicted by pain or are suffering great loss. Please remember that our hope is set on the living God. The extent of our difficulties varies. Some are severe, and some are not as severe. Paul says that we have set our hope on the living God (1 Tim. 4:10). The Holy Spirit has given me this feeling concerning the living God in order to strengthen the saints who are suffering.</p>
<p>I have served the Lord for over thirty years. During this time I have encountered many difficulties and suffered much pain. Once, after passing through a great trial, I told an older brother that we are too weak to withstand the trials. Before we pass through a trial, we think that we are strong and capable of withstanding any trial by means of our iron will and sober mind. But once trials befall us, we realize that our strong will is weak, our sober mind is confused, our ability to withstand disappears, and even our faith is lacking. However, even when we feel that we are incapable, our inner being continues to believe. The faith that we experience at these times is not according to our will, mind, or ability. That faith is the living God.</p>
<p>God not only allows turmoils in our environment, He even takes away what we treasure the most&mdash;His presence. We often experience that the more we pray, the more the heavens seem to close; the more we seek the Lord, the farther away He seems; and the more we read the Bible, the more we cannot touch His words. At such times, we must beware of Satan&rsquo;s attacks, lies, and deceit. All our situations are false and unreal. Anything that cannot last forever is false. God can change our situation at any time; hence, we should not set our eyes on our situation but on God. Our hearts should be turned to God because we have set our hope on the living God. Even though we cannot get through when we pray or worship, we must continue to pray and worship. When we are at our weakest point, our worship is the most precious to God. The weak prayers that we utter are pleasing to God. They are sweet to His ears.</p>
<p>However, we must not be superstitious. Sometimes our living Lord lets us suffer because of our wrongdoing. We cannot claim to have faith in Him if we stubbornly remain in our wrongdoing and are not willing to be enlightened and dealt with. Our living God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all (1 John 1:5). He is righteous; righteousness is the foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14). He is holy, and He wants His people to also be holy (Heb. 2:11; 1 Pet. 1:16). Therefore, He shines on us and convicts us in order for us to accept His judgment, dealing, and correction so that we may walk with Him in the light. The faith that we experience after such an experience is not superstition.</p>
<p>After Daniel was thrown into the lions&rsquo; den, he said to King Darius, &ldquo;My God has sent His angel and has shut the lions&rsquo; mouth, and they have not hurt me, inasmuch as before Him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm&rdquo; (Dan. 6:22). Had Daniel been wrong, God would not have shut the lions&rsquo; mouth. Daniel had living faith in the living God because he was restricted by God, and he was guiltless before God and man. Similarly, whenever we fall into difficulties or distressing trials, we should not first seek our deliverance; rather, we should seek His shining. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I prostrate myself before You and look to You for Your shining.&rdquo; The faith with which we believe in the living God is not superstition. Rather, it is genuine faith that comes from our being shined on, dealt with, and subdued in His hand. Only such faith can enable us to experience the living God in our sufferings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FEARING THE LIVING GOD</h2>
<p>We must learn to fear the living God. We must not be loose; God is not mocked (Gal. 6:7). Two thousand years of church history prove that a Christian who does not fear God will not have a good ending; such a Christian will have a miserable ending. God often lets the Gentiles be, but He is never loose with His children; He is not loose with those who belong to Him. He disciplines us so that we may partake of His holiness. The Bible says, &ldquo;Whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives&rdquo; (Heb. 12:6), and it says that judgment begins from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17). Hence, we must fear God. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;our God is also a consuming fire&rdquo; (Heb. 10:31; 12:29). We belong to the living God. We should not think that He does not see when we are loose or that He does not hear the things we say. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. We must learn to fear Him.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1948 I gave a message concerning God being a living God whom we should fear. In the audience there was an educated brother who loved the Lord, but he sinned against God&rsquo;s government because he did not fear God. The brothers did not know how to help him. Later, this brother died in an accident. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. The living God whom we serve is not mocked. He searches our intentions, thoughts, emotions, and everything about us; nothing can be kept hidden from Him. We must fear Him and know that He is a judging God and that judgment begins from His house. We must fear God in our intentions, thoughts, attitudes, living, and service because He is a living God who is not mocked.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
