   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In many respects the United States is a good place for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everything is here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is quite easy to find a job working eight hours a day, five days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This gives us Saturday, the Lord's Day, and all of the evenings during the week for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is an excellent situation for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, if you are not for the church life, the American way of living is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not have the church life, what will occupy you?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What will you do on the weekends and in the evenings?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Where will you go?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No doubt you will be attracted to various amusements, sports, and nightclubs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of these things will become snares.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are here for the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We praise the Lord that the United States exists for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The United States is not only for the church life in this country, but for the spreading of the church life throughout the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have you ever noticed the strategic geographic location of the United States?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The United States is located at the crossroads of the world with two great oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific, on two sides like the two wings of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is easy to move in any direction from the United States: from the Pacific coast we can take care of Asia and the Far East; from the Atlantic coast we can take care of Europe and Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can also take care of North and South America.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord can never be wrong, and He has chosen the United States for the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of the modern conveniences are likewise for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the last century it took several months to travel from New York to Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now a jet can fly this distance in less than six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not for the jets; the jets are for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not for this age; this age is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not need to care for this age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord cares for us, and this age is for us as long as we are for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you" Matt 6:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of the things will be free if we buy the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom costs something; we must pay for it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we pay the price of the kingdom, our livelihood will be free.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord will care for us if we do not care for this age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should beware of the deceitfulness of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, if you care for this age, money will mean much to you and will snare you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are free from the anxiety of this age, we will not care for money.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will make money for the sake of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE GOOD GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not a cursed field growing thorns; we are a blessed field growing Christ as the real wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our source is not the serpent; our source is the God of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>So we are not cursed; we are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the cursed earth whose source is the serpent that produces thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We, however, come from another source, from our Father, the God of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we are a field, a farm, much blessed by our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We grow Christ, the real wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not the wayside nor the rocky place nor the thorny earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are the good earth, growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we have seen, the seeds are sown in Matthew and the development of the seeds takes place in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we remember this principle, we will discover much from our reading of the New Testament.</S>
