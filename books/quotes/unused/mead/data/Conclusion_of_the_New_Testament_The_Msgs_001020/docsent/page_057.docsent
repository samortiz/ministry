   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Predestinating the Believers before the Foundation of the World</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's work in eternity past also included His predestinating marking out the believers before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning this, Ephesians 1:5 says, "Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word rendered "predestinated" may also be translated "marked out beforehand."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Marking out beforehand is the process, while predestination is the purpose to determine a destiny beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God first selected us and then marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world, unto a certain destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The destiny of God's marking us out beforehand is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, as God's creatures, we need to be regenerated by Him so that we may participate in His life to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sonship implies not only the life of a son but also the position of a son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's marked-out ones have both the life to be His sons and also the position of sons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God predestinated us according to His foresight 1 Pet 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that our relationship with God was initiated by Him according to His foreknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, God predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Through Jesus Christ" means through the Redeemer, who is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through Him we have been redeemed to be the sons of God with the life and position of God's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 1:5 says that God predestinated us unto sonship according to the good pleasure of His will, which is His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has a will in which is His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God predestinated us to be His sons according to this pleasure, according to the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 1:4 says that God has chosen us to be holy, and verse 5 says that He has predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"To be holy" is the procedure, and "unto sonship" is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been predestinated unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, God has chosen us to be holy so that we might be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, to be holy is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God does not merely want a group of holy people; He desires many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It may seem to us that it is adequate for God to choose us to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may be fully satisfied with this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, God has chosen us to be holy for a purpose that we might be the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I was young, I loved Ephesians 1:4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, at first I thought that God had predestinated me unto heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then I thought that I was predestinated unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many of us may have thought the same thing, reading into the Bible something of our own concept.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Ephesians 1:5 does not say that God has predestinated us unto heaven or unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It says that we have been predestinated unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God made a firm decision before the foundation of the world that we would be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In eternity past, God, through His foresight, marked us out from among a vast number of people to be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was not initiated by us in time; it was initiated by God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Probably Making a Counsel among the Trinity of the Godhead concerning the Coming Creation and Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In eternity past God probably also made a counsel among the Trinity of the Godhead concerning the coming creation and redemption, as indicated, or implied, by Acts 2:23, which says, "This man Jesus , delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to the cross and killed."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A bracketed insertion in translation of Acts 2:23 says that "the determined counsel of God" was decided "in the council held by the Trinity."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In eternity past God should have made a plan according to His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then according to this plan, He selected us and marked us out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His foreknowledge God knew that the creation would become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, probably among the Trinity of the Godhead there was a conference concerning the coming creation and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A decision was made regarding how to create the universe and how to redeem it after it had become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that the Lord's crucifixion was not an accident in human history, but a purposeful fulfillment of the divine counsel determined by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ's death was also according to the foreknowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be His redeeming Lamb John 1:29 for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world 1 Pet 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was done according to God's eternal purpose and plan, not accidentally.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain Rev 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the revelation we have collected from Acts 2:23, 1 Peter 1:20, and Revelation 13:8, the redemption accomplished by Christ through His crucifixion is a great thing in the heart of God for the carrying out of His eternal plan according to His good pleasure.</S>
