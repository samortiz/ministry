   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, in order for the believer to receive this power of the Holy Spirit, some works must be accomplished on his side.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He must have a specific surrender; he must get rid of all the dubious things and actions in his life; he must be willing to fully obey the will of God; he must believe that God will pour the power of the Holy Spirit into his spirit; and he must pray for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If there is no obstacle on the side of the believer, God will immediately accomplish what he hopes for.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believer does not need to wait for the Holy Spirit to come and fill him, because the Holy Spirit has descended long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The believer only has to wait for the cross to work deeply enough within him to fulfill the necessary condition for the Holy Spirit's filling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the believer is faithful, obedient, and believing, then in a very short time the power of the Holy Spirit will be poured into his spirit, making him strong and providing the strength to live and work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For some believers, just one instance of surrendering to the Lord may enable them to immediately receive this filling without any delay, because they have fulfilled the necessary condition for the Holy Spirit's filling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The pouring of the Holy Spirit's power into the believer it may also be called the believer's being filled by the Holy Spirit is a matter which occurs in the spirit, the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Holy Spirit does not fill man's feeling or body, rather He fills the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The "inner man" is aroused and becomes strong with energy from the Holy Spirit, not the outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is most important, because it will keep us from seeking for physical feelings, such as shakings, spasms, and falling down, when we seek the filling of the Holy Spirit, rather than simply applying faith Gal 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, a believer must be careful never to regard his faith as an excuse for not needing the inward strengthening of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The conditions must be fulfilled, and the attitude must be firm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God will accomplish His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we read what the apostle said in the subsequent passage concerning how to apprehend, know, and be filled, then we will realize that the strengthening in the spirit causes the consciousness of our spirit to become very clearly manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit, like the body, has its functions and consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the believer has not yet had the power of the Holy Spirit poured abundantly into his spirit, it is very difficult for him to perceive the intuition of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once he has had the new experience of being strengthened in the spirit, his spirit's intuition becomes clearly manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Consequently, many believers will more easily know the intuition of their own spirit because their inner man has become strong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When this happens, they will be more able to feel the slight movements of their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A spirit that is full of the power of the Holy Spirit can control the soul and body and make them completely submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regardless of whether it is thought, desire, feeling, or intention, everything must be controlled by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will keep the soul from acting independently; rather, the soul will be the steward of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will also enable the Holy Spirit to flow out the life of God through the spirit of the believer so that He may water and revive those who are dried up and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is different from the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This strengthening emphasizes life or living it also affects the work ; however, the baptism in the Holy Spirit is particularly for the purpose of the work.</S>
