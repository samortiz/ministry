In this stage we experience and enjoy God as the Father in the love of the Triune God, we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God, and we experience and enjoy the Spirit as the consummation of the Divine Trinity in the fellowship of the Triune God. When we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son, we enjoy Him as our portion, as covered in Lessons Thirty through Thirty-six of Volume Three, and we also experience His living in us.<h2 class=head2>II. Living in Us</h2><p>That Christ lives in us does not mean that He lives instead of us but that He lives with us. In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&#8221; &#8220;No longer I&#8221; does not indicate an exchanged life, a life in which Christ comes in and we go out, for later in this verse Paul said, &#8220;I live.&#8221; As regenerated people, we have both the old &#8220;I,&#8221; which has been crucified (Rom. 6:6), and a new &#8220;I,&#8221; which has been regenerated. Concerning the old &#8220;I,&#8221; Paul said, &#8220;No longer I&#8221;; concerning the new &#8220;I,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I live.&#8221; The old, crucified &#8220;I&#8221; was without divinity; the new, regenerated &#8220;I&#8221; has God as life added to it. The new &#8220;I&#8221; came into being when the old &#8220;I&#8221; was resurrected and God was added to it. On the one hand, Paul had been terminated, but on the other hand, a resurrected Paul, one who was regenerated with God as his life, still lived. Furthermore, although Paul said, &#8220;No longer I,&#8221; he also said, &#8220;It is Christ who lives in me,&#8221; for it was Christ who lived, but it was in Paul that He lived. It is the same with all the believers in Christ today. Christ and we, and we and Christ, have one life and one living.<p>John 14 may help us to know how Christ lives in us. Before His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, &#8220;Because I live, you also shall live&#8221; (v. 19). This shows us that the resurrected Christ does not live alone; He lives in us and with us. He lives in us by enabling us to live with Him. In a very real sense, if we do not live with Him, He cannot live in us. We have not been altogether ruled out, and our life has not been exchanged for the divine life. We continue to live, and we live with Christ.<p>The illustration of grafting may also help us to know this matter. After a branch is grafted into a tree, the branch still lives, yet not by itself, but by the tree into which it has been grafted. Furthermore, the tree also lives in the grafted branch. Hence, the life that is lived out by the branch is a grafted life. This is not to exchange a life that is not good with a life that is better; rather, it is to join two lives as one so that they may enjoy a mingled life and living. The branch and the tree have one life and one living. Likewise, Christ living in us enables us to have one life and one living with Him.<p>In John 6:57 the Lord said, &#8220;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&#8221; That the Son lived because of the Father does not mean that the Son was set aside and ceased to exist. The Son, of course, continued to exist, but He did not live His own life. He lived the life of the Father. The Son and the Father had one life and one living. It is the same in our relationship with Christ today. We have one life and one living with Christ. We live by Him, and He lives in us. If we do not live, He does not live; and if He does not live, we cannot live. On the one hand, we are terminated; on the other hand, we continue to live, but we do not live by ourselves. We live by having Him living in us.<h2 class=head2>1. That We May Walk in Him</h2><p>Christ lives in us that we may live with Him, enabling us to walk in Him. Colossians 2:6 says, &#8220;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&#8221; To walk is to live, to act, to behave, and to have our being. We should walk, live, and act in Christ that we may enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived in the good land, enjoying all its rich produce. The children of Israel had the good land as their portion, and they lived and walked in the good land. Today, in our experience Christ should be our good land as our unique portion, in which we may live and walk.<p>Galatians 3:14 says, &#8220;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&#8221; Here Paul mentions the blessing of Abraham and the promise of the Spirit. The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (see Col. 1:12 and note 2, Recovery Version). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds with the blessing of the promised land. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God&#8217;s bountiful supply for us to enjoy. Hence, to live and walk in Christ as the good land is to live and walk in the all-inclusive Spirit. Therefore, Galatians 5:16 says, &#8220;Walk by the Spirit,&#8221; and Romans 8:4 says, &#8220;Walk...according to the spirit.&#8221; The Spirit is dwelling now in our regenerated spirit and is mingled with our regenerated spirit. We must live and move continually in the mingled spirit that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the good land. In the New Testament nothing is more basic, more important, and more powerful than walking according to the mingled spirit. Christ became the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit to be our life, our person, and our everything. What we need is to turn to Him, to set our mind on the spirit, and to live and move according to the spirit. This is to live and walk in Christ.<h2 class=head2>2. That We May Be Saved in His Life</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s living in us also enables us to be saved in His life. Romans 5:10 says, &#8220;For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.&#8221; This verse speaks of Christ&#8217;s reconciling death and Christ&#8217;s saving life. Although we have been saved through the death of Christ, we still need to be saved in His life. On the one hand, we have been saved through Christ&#8217;s death from God&#8217;s eternal judgment and eternal punishment; on the other hand, we still need to be saved continuously in His life from many negative things until we reach the extent of glory.<p>To be saved in Christ&#8217;s life is to be saved in Christ Himself as life. He dwells in us, and we are organically one with Him. By the growth of His life in us, we will enjoy His full salvation to the uttermost. We have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God that we may be brought into union with Christ, so that He can save us in His life to the extent that we are sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God&#8217;s Son, that we may be completely delivered from our old man, our self, and our natural life. This is the issue of Christ&#8217;s saving us continuously in His life by His living in us and dispensing Himself into our entire being.<h2 class=head2>3. That We May Live by Him by Eating Him as the Bread of Life</h2><p>Christ lives in us that we also may eat Him as the bread of life and thereby live by Him. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (John 6:48) and &#8220;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&#8221; (v. 57). The bread of life is man&#8217;s life supply in the form of food. Christ is not only the food but also the bread of life to us; He is our life supply to sustain our spiritual life.<p>John 6 shows us five characteristics of the Lord Jesus as the bread of life. As the bread that came down out of heaven (vv. 41, 50-51, 58), He is the heavenly bread. As the bread of God (v. 33), He belongs to God. As the bread of life (vv. 35, 48), He is the bread with eternal life. As the living bread (v. 51), He is living. As the true bread (v. 32), He is the bread of truth or reality. If we eat Christ as the bread of life, continually receiving Him into us to be assimilated by our regenerated new man in the way of life, He will bring us the eternal life that we may live because of Him, so that we are not only heavenly and of God but also living and full of reality.<h2 class=head2>4. That We May Live Together with Him</h2><p>First Thessalonians 5:10 says that Christ &#8220;died for us in order that whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him.&#8221; The Lord died for us not only that we might be saved from eternal perdition but also that we may live together with Him through His resurrection. By His resurrection from the dead, He became the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us in order that whether we watch or sleep, that is, whether we live or die, we may live together with Him.<h2 class=head2>5. That We May Live Him</h2><p>In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, &#8220;It is Christ who lives in me,&#8221; and in Philippians 1:21 he said, &#8220;To me, to live is Christ.&#8221; This indicates that Christ lives in us in order that we may live Him. Christ is not only our life but also our living that we may be one with Him in both life and living. Christ lives within us as our life, and we live Him without as His living. When we live, He lives; when He lives, we live. Not only do we live by Christ, live together with Christ, live in Christ, and live for Christ, but we also live Christ.<p>To live Christ is not only to live a sanctified, spiritual, and victorious life, but to live a person, that is, to live a life that is Christ Himself. Because Christ lives in us, we can live Him by enjoying His divine dispensing and thus be one with Him both in life and in living. We must practice living Christ daily, taking Him as our life and person. This is the destiny given by God to us in His economy, and it is the goal of our Christian living.<h2 class=head2>6. That We May Have Him Formed in Us</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s living in us is also that we may have Him formed in us. In Galatians 4:19 Paul said, &#8220;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.&#8221; Galatians shows us that Christ has been revealed in us (1:16), He is now living in us (2:20), and He will be formed in us. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ fully grown in us. First, Christ was born into us at the time of our regeneration, then He lives in us in our Christian life, and eventually, He will be formed in us at our maturity.<p>Christ&#8217;s being formed in us indicates that our whole being is being constituted of Christ. This is a living, organic matter. Christ is living now in us so that He may be the constituent of our entire being-our mind, emotion, and will, that is, that He may constitute every part of our soul so that every part of our being will bear His form, His image.<h2 class=head2>7. That We May Magnify Him</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s living in us also enables us to magnify Him. Paul said, &#8220;As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&#8221; (Phil. 1:20). For Christ to be magnified is for Him to be shown or declared great (without limitation), exalted, and extolled. Hence, to magnify Christ is to express Christ without limitation. When we magnify Christ, we display to the whole universe that the Christ who lives in us and the Christ whom we live is unlimited. Even when Paul was suffering mistreatment in prison, he still could exhibit Christ in His unlimited greatness. By rejoicing in the Lord in his sufferings, he showed forth the unlimitedness of the Christ whom he experienced and enjoyed. Furthermore, in this way Christ was expressed, exalted, and extolled through him. If Christ is magnified in our body, we become Christ&#8217;s living witnesses, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, wisdom, and everything, all of which are unlimited.<p>The word magnify means to make something large to our sight. Although Christ is universally great and His dimensions-the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth- are unlimited and immeasurable (Eph. 3:18), He is virtually non-existent in the eyes of the unbelievers. Hence, we should magnify Christ in our daily life that He may appear great in others&#8217; eyes. Consequently, through our magnifying of Christ they will turn to Christ and know that Christ is unlimited.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>When we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God, we not only enjoy Him as our portion but also experience His living in us. Christ lives in us that we may have one life and one living with Him. Thus we can walk in Him and enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived and walked in the good land and enjoyed all its rich produce. Christ eventually is realized as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit; hence, to walk in Him is to walk in the all-inclusive Spirit. Christ&#8217;s living in us also enables us to be saved in His life. He desires to save us in His life to the extent that we are sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of Him as God&#8217;s Son, and are completely delivered from our old man, our self, and our natural life. He also enables us to live by Him by our eating Him as the bread of life. Christ is not only life but also the bread of life to us. As we receive Him continuously into us so that He is assimilated by our regenerated new man in the way of life, He brings us the eternal life that we may live because of Him. He also causes us to live with Him and to live Him. This is not only to live a sanctified, spiritual, and victorious life, but to live a person, to live a life that is Christ Himself. He also causes us to have Him formed in us, that is, to have Him fully grown in us to be the constituents of our entire being so that every part of our being will bear His form, His image. He also enables us to magnify Him, that is, to display to the entire universe that the Christ who lives in us and whom we live is unlimited.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ&#8217;s living in us.</li><li>Briefly explain how that to walk in Christ is to walk in the Spirit.</li><li>Briefly explain how Christ in us enables us to be saved in His life.</li><li>What is the significance of living Christ?

That We May Boast in Christ</h2><p>In Philippians 3:3 Paul said, &#8220;For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.&#8221; The circumcision here refers to the New Testament believers, who are genuinely circumcised by Christ&#8217;s crucifixion. They are absolutely different from the Judaizers, who are circumcised in the flesh. The New Testament believers serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of the law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they do not have confidence in the flesh but in the Spirit. The Greek word rendered boast here also means &#8220;exult.&#8221; Our boast, our exulting, is not in our outward behavior, actions, or doings, but in Christ, who lives in us. When we experience and enjoy Christ&#8217;s living in us, we are enabled to boast, to exult, in Him.<h2 class=head2>9. That We May Be Found in Christ</h2><p>In Philippians 3:9 Paul said that he earnestly desired to be found in Christ. Paul had been altogether in the Jewish religion under the law and had always been found by others in the law, because he was a person altogether enveloped, encased, fully boxed in, by the law. But at his conversion he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ and became &#8220;a man in Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:2). Now he expected to be found in Christ, not in culture, philosophy, or religion, by all who observed him-the Jews, the angels, and the demons. This indicates that he aspired to have his whole being immersed in and saturated with Christ that all who observed him might find him fully in Christ.<p>It is one thing to have a doctrinal understanding of being found in Christ; it is quite another thing to be found in Christ in our daily living. Where we are when others observe us indicates the realm in which we live. To be found in Christ means that Christ is the realm in which we live and that He is our unique expression. Paul could be found in Christ because Christ was his expression. In every aspect and from every angle, only Christ could be seen upon him. Christ became his unique expression. Likewise, today we should also desire to be found in Christ and not in our natural virtues, culture, or religion.<p>If we would be found in Christ, we need to be watchful moment by moment, continually on the alert to live in Christ, that we may not be distracted from Christ and live in something other than Christ. We must continually experience and enjoy the Christ who lives in us and live Him that we may become those who are actually in Christ in experience. Then when others observe us, they will find us in Christ and in Christ alone.<h2 class=head2>10. That We May Count All Things as Loss and Refuse in order to Gain Christ</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s living in us also enables us to count all things as loss and refuse that we may gain Christ. In Philippians 3:7-8 Paul said, &#8220;But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.&#8221; All the different gains were counted as one loss by Paul because they all issued in one thing, that is, the loss of Christ; they all hindered him and held him back from participating in and enjoying Christ. Hence, on account of Christ all the gains were a loss to him. Refuse denotes dregs, rubbish, filth, what is thrown to the dogs; hence, dog food, dung. There is no comparison between these things and Christ.<p>What things in verse 7 are the things mentioned in verses 5 and 6, the things related to law and religion. With Paul, all things in verse 8 refers mainly to three categories of things-religion, philosophy, and culture. It is true, of course, that worldly, material things occupy people and keep them from experiencing Christ. However, Paul realized that the things which truly frustrate people from the experience of Christ are mainly the things of religion, philosophy, and culture. To gain Christ is to pay the price to experience, enjoy, and appropriate all His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8). Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9) and the reality of the shadow of all positive things (vv. 16-17). Paul counted all things to be loss and refuse that he might gain such a unique, excellent Christ. We also should count all things as loss and refuse that we may gain Christ as Paul did.<h2 class=head2>11. That We May Know Christ and the Power of His Resurrection and the Fellowship of His Sufferings</h2><p>In Philippians 3:10 Paul said, &#8220;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.&#8221; In verse 8 of the same chapter, to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is by revelation. But here, to know Christ is by experience-to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. We first receive the revelation of Christ and then seek for the experience of Christ-to know and enjoy Him in an experiential way.<p>According to Paul&#8217;s concept, if we would know Christ in an experiential way, we must first gain Christ and be found in Him. Moreover, to be found in Him requires us first to count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. Only when we have the vision of the supreme preciousness and surpassing worth of Christ will we be willing to let go of everything else and count those things as refuse. Then we will gain Christ and be found in Him. In this way, we will surely know Him in experience.<p>Not only do we seek to know Christ, but we also seek to know the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. To know Christ is to know Him in a general way; to know the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings is to know the details related to the knowledge of Christ. The power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection is His resurrection life, which raised Him from the dead (Eph. 1:19-20). To know, to experience, this power requires identification with Christ&#8217;s death and conformity to it. Death is the base of resurrection. Therefore, to experience the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, we need to live a crucified life, as He did. Our conformity to His death affords a base for the power of His resurrection to rise up that His divine life may be expressed in us.<p>The fellowship of His sufferings, that is, the participation in Christ&#8217;s sufferings (Matt. 20:22-23; Col. 1:24), is a necessary condition for the experience of the power of His resurrection (2 Tim. 2:11) by being conformed to His death. Paul was pursuing to know and experience not only the excellency of Christ Himself but also the life power of His resurrection and the participation in His sufferings. With Christ, the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection; with us, the power of His resurrection comes first, followed by the participation in His sufferings and conformity to His death. We first receive the power of His resurrection; then by this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death. Such sufferings are mainly for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ (Col. 1:24).<p>In a very real sense, Christ&#8217;s sufferings have not yet been completed. In Colossians 1:24 Paul said, &#8220;I now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.&#8221; Christ is the Head. His sufferings for the accomplishing of redemption were completed, but His sufferings for the producing and building up of the church are not yet finished. Therefore, Paul regarded his own sufferings as the filling up of that which is lacking of Christ&#8217;s afflictions for His Body. Christ suffered when He was on the earth. As those who follow Him, we also must participate in His sufferings for His Body. If we would know Christ by experiencing the power of His resurrection, we must share His sufferings.<h2 class=head2>12. That We May Be Conformed to His Death</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s living in us also causes us to be conformed to His death. In Philippians 3:10 Paul said, &#8220;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&#8221; This word indicates that Paul desired to take Christ&#8217;s death as the mold of his life. Paul lived a crucified life continually, a life under the cross, just as Christ did in His human living. Through such a life, Paul was able to experience and express the resurrection power of Christ. The mold of Christ&#8217;s death refers to Christ&#8217;s experience of continually putting to death His human life that He might live by the life of God (John 6:57). Our life should be conformed to such a mold by our dying to our human life to live the divine life.<p>Christ&#8217;s death occurred throughout His life on earth. As He was living, He was also dying, dying to the old creation in order to live a life in the new creation. This is the meaning of His death in Philippians 3:10. By living such a crucified life, He continually put His human life to death and lived to God, even lived God. When we are willing to suffer for Christ and His Body, we also need to live only to Him and put to death our natural life, so that the inner divine life may be released. Then in our experience we will be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death.<p>We need to be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death because we are natural and belong to the old man and the self. In the death of Christ, man&#8217;s natural life has been slain, and the old man has been crucified and annulled. The form of Christ&#8217;s death does not bear the mark of the natural man, the old man, or the self. In other words, when we participate in the death of Christ, we will be molded by His death, being conformed to His death. To be thus molded by Christ&#8217;s death will cause our natural life, our old man, and our self to be dealt with. Hence, in Christ&#8217;s death we do not have our natural life, our old man, or the activities of our self. Since all these have been gotten rid of by the mold of Christ&#8217;s death, we can be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death.<h2 class=head2>13. That We May Be Delivered from Every Evil Work</h2><p>Because Christ lives in us, we can also be delivered from every evil work. In 2 Timothy 4:18 Paul said, &#8220;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me into His heavenly kingdom.&#8221; Every evil work here refers mainly to man&#8217;s persecution, which usually comes from Satan&#8217;s evilness (Matt. 6:13). Paul suffered a great deal of persecution, yet he was confident that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work.<p>Paul&#8217;s being delivered from every evil work included even his final martyrdom. Since martyrdom ushered Paul into the heavenly kingdom, such an ushering was a deliverance to him. There is no other time that the Lord dispenses Himself in so great a measure into the believers as in the time of their suffering of martyrdom. Whenever the believers suffer persecution, encounter afflictions, and even suffer martyrdom because of their loving the Lord, the Lord infuses and dispenses all His riches into them that they may be strengthened to overcome and be delivered from every evil work. Such a deliverance is what we believers should believe in, hope for, and experience, and it is also what the Lord is pleased to give us.<h2 class=head2>14. That We May Enjoy His Sufficient Grace and His Overshadowing Power</h2><p>Christ lives in us that we may enjoy His sufficient grace and His overshadowing power. This is the experience of Paul in 2 Corinthians 12. Paul suffered because of a thorn in his flesh, and concerning this, he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him. Nevertheless, the Lord said to him, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.&#8221; Because he accepted the Lord&#8217;s word, he could say, &#8220;Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me&#8221; (vv. 7-9). The Lord did not remove the thorn from Paul, but He supplied him with sufficient grace so that he might be able to bear the suffering. Then, in his experience, this grace became the overshadowing power which was perfected in his weaknesses.<p>The grace mentioned here is not what the Lord has done or what He has given; it is the Lord Himself as our supply and enjoyment, sustaining and strengthening us from within that we may meet all kinds of circumstances. This is the living and genuine grace. This grace is nothing less than Christ Himself, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, dispensed into our entire being to be enjoyed by us in our experience. Therefore, we need to learn not to expect something from outside or to ask the Lord to do something for us. Rather, we should simply enjoy the Lord Himself as the true grace.<p>The Greek word translated tabernacle over in verse 9 is a compound verb composed of two words. The first word means upon, and the second, to dwell in a tent. The compound verb here means to fix a tent or a habitation upon. It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weaknesses. To magnify the sufficiency of the Lord&#8217;s grace, we cannot avoid sufferings. To show forth the perfectness of the Lord&#8217;s power, we need weaknesses. Hence, Paul would most gladly boast in his weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him. Grace is the supply, and power is the strength, the ability, of grace. Both are the resurrected Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us (1 Cor. 15:45; Gal. 2:20) for our enjoyment.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>When we experience and enjoy Christ&#8217;s living in us, we are enabled to boast and exult not in our outward behavior, actions, or doings but in the Christ who lives in us. Christ&#8217;s living in us also enables us to be found in Him, who has become the realm in which we live and our unique expression. Christ&#8217;s living in us also enables us to count all things as loss and refuse that we may gain Him. All things, such as religion, philosophy, and culture, and other worldly, material things, can hinder and frustrate us from partaking of and enjoying the unique, excellent Christ. He also causes us to know Him, that is, to know and enjoy Him in our experience; to know the power of His resurrection, that is, the resurrection life that raised Him from the dead; and to know the fellowship of His sufferings, that is, to participate in Christ&#8217;s sufferings. Furthermore, Christ&#8217;s living in us causes us to be conformed to His death, that is, to be molded by His death into the form of His death, so that we do not have our natural life, our old man, or the activities of our self. Moreover, when we are suffering persecution, encountering afflictions, and even suffering martyrdom because of our loving Him, He infuses and dispenses all His riches into us that we may be strengthened to overcome and thus delivered from every evil work. He also enables us to enjoy Him as our sufficient grace and overshadowing power, overshadowing us in our weaknesses.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain the meaning of being found in Christ.</li><li>Why is it that in order to gain Christ we must count all things as loss and refuse?</li><li>What is the difference between having the excellency of the knowledge of Christ in Philippians 3:8 and knowing Christ in 3:10?</li><li>What is the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, and how can we know and experience it?</li><li>How can we be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death?</li></ol><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST AS THE SON IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(10)</h1><h2 class=head3>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Living in us:	<ol class="decimal" start="15">	<li>That we may be able to do all things in Him who empowers us.</li>	<li>That we may have Him making His home in our hearts.</li>	<li>That we may be rooted and grounded in love.</li>	<li>That we may apprehend His breadth, length, height, and depth.</li>	<li>That we may know His knowledge-surpassing love.</li>	<li>That we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</li>	<li>That we may be built up in Him.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head3>TEXT</h2><p>In this lesson we will continue to see the remaining aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ living in us in the grace of the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>15. That We May Be Able to Do All Things in Him Who Empowers Us</h2><p>Christ living in us enables us to do all things in Him who empowers us. In Philippians 4:13 Paul said, &#8220;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.&#8221; To be empowered is to be made dynamic inwardly. Christ dwells in us (Col. 1:27). He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within, not from without. By such inward empowering Paul was able to do all things in Christ. Paul was a person in Christ (2 Cor. 12:2), and he desired to be found in Christ by others. Now he declared that he was able to do all things in Him, the very Christ who empowered him. This is an all-inclusive and concluding word on his experience of Christ. It is the converse of the Lord&#8217;s word in John 15:5 concerning our organic union with Him: &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&#8221;<p>All things in Philippians 4:13 refers to all the things, mentioned in verse 12, that we have learned to be content with in the course of our human life and to the human virtues listed in verse 8. This means that by the empowering of the Christ who lives in us we can have a life of contentment, knowing both how to be abased and how to abound. Furthermore, we can live out all kinds of virtues, such as being true, being dignified, being righteous, being pure, being lovely, and being well spoken of.<p>Paul&#8217;s word concerning Christ as the One who empowers us is especially suitable in His empowering us that we may live Him as our human virtues and thus magnify Him in His unlimited greatness. If we desire to experience Christ as the One who empowers us that we may be able to do all things in Him, we need to allow Him to live in us (Gal. 2:20), to be formed in us (4:19), to make His home in us (Eph. 3:17), and to be magnified in us (Phil. 1:20). In this way, by the empowering of the indwelling Christ, we are able to live a satisfied life and live Christ as our human virtues.<h2 class=head2>16. That We May Have Him Making His Home in Our Hearts</h2><p>Ephesians 3:17a speaks of Christ&#8217;s making His home in our hearts. This is a deeper work of Christ&#8217;s living in us, and it is also our more advanced experience of the indwelling Christ. Our heart is the totality of all our inward parts-the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience. When Christ makes His home in our heart, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself. When we were saved, Christ came into our spirit. Now He also wants to spread into every part of our inward being. As we are strengthened into our inner man, our regenerated spirit, the way is opened for Christ to spread in us, from our spirit to our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. The more Christ spreads within us, the more He settles down in us and makes His home in us.<p>We may liken our heart to a house with many rooms, including the rooms of the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience. Although we have Christ in us, we still need to allow Him to settle down in our heart to saturate, possess, occupy, and fill every room within us. For this cause, we need to pray to the Father that He would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our regenerated spirit (v. 16) that we may receive the divine dispensing. Thus, Christ will spread into every part of our entire being and make His home in our heart.<h2 class=head2>17. That We May Be Rooted and Grounded in Love</h2><p>Ephesians 3:17b goes on to say that this Christ who lives in us and who is making His home in our hearts will cause us to be rooted and grounded in His love. Our being rooted and grounded in love is related to our being God&#8217;s cultivated land and God&#8217;s building (1 Cor. 3:9). As God&#8217;s cultivated land, we need to be rooted for growth, and as God&#8217;s building, we need to be grounded for our building up. Thus, our being rooted and grounded is a matter concerning life and building, indicating that we believers experience Christ for life and building. When Christ makes His home in our hearts, He saturates all our inward parts with Himself. By such a divine dispensing, we are being rooted and grounded in His love, and spontaneously there will be life and building.<p>Ephesians 3:17 mentions faith and love at the same time. Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith that we may be rooted and grounded in His love. To experience Christ we need faith and love (1 Tim. 1:14). Faith enables us to apprehend Christ, and love enables us to enjoy Him. Neither faith nor love are ours; they are His. His faith becomes our faith, by which we believe in Him, and His love becomes our love, by which we love Him. The love in which we are rooted and grounded is the divine love realized and experienced by us in a practical way. With such a love we love the Lord, and with that same love we love one another. When we are rooted and grounded in Christ&#8217;s love, we grow and are built up in His life.<h2 class=head2>18. That We May Apprehend His Breadth, Length, Height, and Depth</h2><p>Ephesians 3:18 says that we &#8220;may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are.&#8221; When we have been strengthened into our inner man, Christ can then make His home in our heart and thereby occupy our whole being and saturate it with Himself. In this way, we, being rooted and grounded in Christ&#8217;s love, are full of strength to apprehend the dimensions of Christ.<p>The dimensions of Christ are the breadth, length, height, and depth, which are the dimensions of the universe. To apprehend such dimensions of Christ we need all the saints, not individually but corporately. In our experience of Christ, we first experience the breadth of what He is, and then the length. This is horizontal. When we advance in Christ, we experience the height and depth of His riches. This is vertical. First, we experience Christ spreading as the breadth and the length. Then, we experience Him rising up as the height and descending as the depth. Thus, our experience of Christ is three-dimensional, like a cube; it is not one-dimensional, like a line. We must go back and forth and up and down in our experience of the Christ who lives in us, that eventually our experience of Him may be a solid &#8220;cube.&#8221; When our experience is like this, we cannot fall or be broken.<h2 class=head2>19. That We May Know His Knowledge-surpassing Love</h2><p>When Christ lives in us, He not only enables us to experience and enjoy Him making His home in our hearts, to be rooted and grounded in love, and to apprehend His breadth, length, height, and depth, but He also enables us to know His knowledge-surpassing love (Eph. 3:19a). The love of Christ surpasses knowledge, yet we can know it by experiencing it. According to our mentality, the love of Christ is beyond our understanding. Our mind is not able to know it. But since we have Christ living in us, we are enabled in our spirit to know the love of Christ through our experience and enjoyment of Him.<p>Actually, the love of Christ is Christ Himself. Just as Christ is immeasurable, so also is His love; hence, it is knowledge-surpassing. Even so, we can know it in our spirit, not by knowledge but by experience. Christ in His universal dimensions and in His immeasurable love is like a vast, limitless ocean for us to experience and enjoy adequately.<h2 class=head2>20. That We May Be Filled unto All the Fullness of God</h2><p>Ephesians 3:19b says, &#8220;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; When Christ makes His home in our hearts so that we, being rooted and grounded in love, are able to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know by experience His knowledge-surpassing love, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God, which is the church, the corporate expression of God for the fulfillment of His heart&#8217;s desire.<p>The fullness of God implies that the riches of all that God is have become His expression. When the riches of God are in God Himself, they are His riches. But when the riches are expressed, they become His fullness (John 1:16). All the fullness of God dwells in Christ (Col. 1:19; 2:9). Through His indwelling, Christ continually imparts the fullness of God into our being that we may be filled even unto all the fullness of God to be the practical manifestation of the church, in which God may be glorified in His expression.<p>In the New Testament the fullness is the expression through the completeness of the riches. The riches of Christ are all that Christ is and has and all that He has accomplished, attained, and obtained. The fullness of Christ is the result and issue of our enjoyment of these riches. When we enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches, having been assimilated into our being metabolically, constitute us to be the fullness of Christ, the Body of Christ, the church, as His expression. First, in Ephesians 1:23 this expression is the fullness of Christ, and then in 3:19 it is the fullness of God, for the fullness of Christ, the embodiment of God, is the very fullness of the Triune God. Hence, to be filled unto the fullness of God is the issue of the believers&#8217; deeper, higher, and richer experience of Christ.<h2 class=head2>21. That We May Be Built Up in Him</h2><p>The last aspect of our enjoyment and experience of Christ living in us in the grace of the Triune God is that we may be built up in Him. Colossians 2:7 says that we have been rooted and are being built up in Him. This shows that, like plants, we the believers are living organisms. As such, we have been rooted in Christ, our soil, our earth, that we may absorb all His riches as nourishment. These riches become the element and substance with which we grow and are built up. To be rooted is for the growth in life. This rooting has been completed already. To be built up is for the building of the Body of Christ. This is still going on. Both these matters are in Christ.<p>This verse puts rooting and building together, indicating that rooting is for growth, and growth is the genuine building. Growth is not only for building, but is actually the building itself. Since we have been rooted in Christ, we need to remain in our spirit to absorb the nourishment of the riches of Christ that we may grow. By this growth we are transformed into precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12) for the building of the church, the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>When we experience and enjoy Christ living in us in the grace of the Triune God, He enables us to do all things in Him who empowers us. He empowers us from within that we may be content in whatever circumstances we are and that we may live out all kinds of virtues to express His human virtues. He also causes us to have Him making His home in our hearts. We need to be strengthened into our inner man that He may spread in us, from our spirit to our mind, emotion, will, and conscience, so that He may fill and occupy our every inward part and thus settle down, make home, in our heart. He also causes us to be rooted and grounded in love. This indicates that we believers experience Christ for life and building. When Christ saturates all our inward parts with Himself through the divine dispensing, we are being rooted and grounded in His love; that is, we are growing in His life and are being built up. He also enables us to apprehend with all the saints His breadth, length, height, and depth that, step by step, our experience of Him may be a solid &#8220;cube.&#8221; He enables us also to know His knowledge-surpassing love. The love of Christ is knowledge-surpassing; it is beyond the understanding of our mind. However, we can know the love of Christ in our spirit through our experience and enjoyment of Him. He enables us also to be filled unto all the fullness of God. Through His indwelling, Christ continually imparts into us the fullness of God, which dwells in Him, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God, which is the church, the corporate expression of God. Finally, He enables us to be built up in Him. We have been rooted in Christ as the good land, and we are absorbing all His riches as our nourishment. By this we can grow and be transformed into precious stones for the building of the church, the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ&#8217;s enabling us to be rooted and grounded in love.</li><li>Briefly give the meaning of Christ&#8217;s enabling us to apprehend His breadth, length, height, and depth.</li><li>What is the fullness of God?

We have seen the believers&#8217; experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of the Triune God and their experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God. Beginning with this lesson we will go on to see the believers&#8217; experience and enjoyment of the Spirit as the consummation of the Divine Trinity in the fellowship of the Triune God.<p>After passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Triune God has become the all-inclusive, life-giving, and consummated Spirit to transmit all the riches of the Triune God into us for our experience and enjoyment. Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of &#8220;the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God, for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with Their divine virtues. Hence, when we have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we can experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.<h2 class=head1>I. AS THE REALITY OF CHRIST FOR OUR ENJOYMENT</h2><p>The Spirit as the consummation of the Divine Trinity is the reality of Christ for our enjoyment. John 14:17-20 shows us that the Spirit, the Comforter who is coming, is the embodiment of the Lord Jesus. Verse 17 says, &#8220;The Spirit of reality...abides with you.&#8221; Verse 18 says, &#8220;I [Christ] am coming to you.&#8221; Verse 17 says, &#8220;He [the Comforter]...shall be in you.&#8221; Verse 20 says, &#8220;I [Christ] in you.&#8221; This clearly shows us that when the Holy Spirit comes, Christ comes; that when the Holy Spirit is in us, Christ is in us; and that the Spirit who indwells us is the Christ who died and was resurrected and who comes to abide in us.<p>John 16:12-15 also indicates that the Spirit dwells in us to glorify Christ by revealing Christ to us that Christ may become the reality in us. Verse 13 says, &#8220;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.&#8221; The Spirit of reality does not guide us into the doctrines concerning Christ. Rather, He guides us into all the reality of Christ that all that Christ is and has may become real to us. All that God is and has is embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9; John 16:15), and all that Christ is and has is received by the Spirit and declared as reality to us through the Spirit (John 16:14-15). Hence, when the Spirit is in us, it is Christ who is in us. The Spirit is in us not as the representative of Christ but as the reality of Christ.<p>The Spirit as the reality of Christ includes everything of the Spirit in His person. Concerning His person, the Spirit is the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:15b, 35; Matt. 1:18, 20; John 20:22; Rom. 15:16), who is related to the incarnation of Christ. Incarnation is a matter of bringing God&#8217;s holy nature into His creatures, His chosen people, to make them holy in the divine nature so that they may be holy even as He is holy. The Spirit is also the Spirit of God (Matt. 3:16; Rom. 8:9), who is God reaching us and being applied to us for our experience and enjoyment. The Spirit is also the Spirit of the Father (Matt. 10:20), the flow of the Father that flows with the Father into us, His children, for our intimate enjoyment of Him. The Spirit is also the Spirit of the Lord (Luke 4:18; 2 Cor. 3:17), the Spirit of Jehovah in the Old Testament. Jehovah in the Old Testament is Jesus in the New Testament; hence, the Spirit of the Lord in the New Testament sense is the Spirit of Jesus, the Lord Jesus Himself. The Spirit is also the Spirit of the Son of God (Gal. 4:6) as the reality of the divine sonship to make the divine sonship real in our life, nature, and living. Furthermore, the Spirit is the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9; 1 Pet. 1:11), the Spirit whom Christ became in His resurrection; this Spirit is Christ Himself dwelling in our spirit to dispense Himself into us as the resurrection life and power to deal with the death that is in our nature. The Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7) as the reality of Jesus for Jesus to be near to His believers. The Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19) as the reality of the incarnated One, the One who lived a human life in humanity, who was crucified and resurrected, who is now both in the heavens and dwelling in the believers, and who will be the center of God&#8217;s economy for eternity. The Spirit is the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18); this strongly proves and confirms that the Spirit is the Lord Christ and the Lord Christ is the Spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of the living God (2 Cor. 3:3) and the living God Himself. The Spirit is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b); in resurrection Christ became such a Spirit with a spiritual body, ready to be received by His believers. Not only so, the Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), who is Christ Himself as life imparted into us, the tripartite men; the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29), the Triune God in the Son becoming the Spirit for our enjoyment; the Spirit of reality (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 4:6) as the reality of God, the Father, the Son, the Lord, sonship, life, grace, and every divine thing; the Comforter (John 14:16), the Spirit of reality, as our Advocate taking care of our case; and the Spirit of power (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8) poured upon us for our ministry and move that we may carry out the Lord&#8217;s commission. Moreover, the Spirit is the Spirit of glory and of God (1 Pet. 4:14). The Spirit of glory is the One through whom Christ was glorified in His resurrection (Rom. 1:4). This very Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God Himself, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution for the glorification of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory. The Spirit is the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14), who, not being limited by time or space, makes the redemption accomplished by Christ through His death eternally efficacious. The Spirit is also the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6), the sevenfold intensified Spirit, to strengthen the church in the time of degradation. Ultimately, the Spirit of God is the Spirit (Mark 1:10; Matt. 4:1; 12:31; John 3:5, 34; 7:39; Acts 6:3; 8:18; Gal. 3:2; Rev. 2:7; 14:13; 22:17), the processed, compounded, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, as the eternal portion of the chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified tripartite men to be their life, life supply, and everything.<h2 class=head1>II. WORKING IN US, ON US, AND FOR US</h2><p>In the initial stage of God&#8217;s full salvation, the stage of regeneration, we experienced the sanctification of the Spirit and thus repented unto God. Furthermore, we experienced the dispositional sanctification of the Spirit and were justified. Moreover, when we repented and believed in the Lord, the Spirit brought God&#8217;s life into us, causing us to be regenerated and enabling us to experience the Spirit&#8217;s renewing work in us. In the progressing stage, as we further experience and enjoy the Spirit as the reality of Christ, the Spirit works in us, on us, and for us in many ways.<h2 class=head2>1. Freeing Us by His Law of Life from the Law of Sin and of Death</h2><p>First, we want to see the Spirit&#8217;s freeing us by His law of life from the law of sin and of death. In Romans 8:2 Paul said, &#8220;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&#8221; In this verse law does not denote a commandment but a principle that operates automatically and spontaneously, a natural regulation, a constant and unchanging rule. Every kind of life has its innate law. Therefore, as long as a particular life exists and is free, it can naturally develop its characteristics and manifest its abilities. Such natural characteristics and innate capabilities in a life constitute the law of that life.<p>The life of God is the highest life. Thus, the characteristics and capabilities of the divine life are the highest and most surpassing. Because these highest and surpassing characteristics and capabilities constitute the law of the life of God, this law naturally is the highest and most surpassing. Since by regeneration we have received the life of God, we have naturally received from the life of God the highest and most surpassing law of this life.<p>In Romans 8:2 Paul spoke not merely of the law of life but of the law of the Spirit of life. Both the Spirit and life are related to the working of this law. Life is the contents and issue of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate manifestation of the Triune God. This Triune God, after going through different processes to become the indwelling, life-giving Spirit, dwells in us as the law of the Spirit of life. This law works in us to deliver us from the working of the law of sin in our flesh and enables us to know God and gain God and thereby live Him out. This law of the Spirit of life is the spontaneous power of the Spirit of life. Such a spontaneous law works automatically under the condition that fulfills its requirements. As far as we, the believers in Christ, are concerned, this law has been installed in us. The book of Romans shows us that the requirements we must fulfill in order that the law of the Spirit of life may work are: (1) to walk according to the spirit (8:4); (2) to mind the things of the Spirit-to set the mind on the spirit (vv. 5-6); (3) to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body (v. 13); (4) to be led by the Spirit of God as sons of God (v. 14); (5) to cry to the Father in the spirit of sonship (v. 15); (6) to witness that we are the children of God (v. 16); and (7) to groan for the full sonship, the redemption of our body (v. 23).<p>The major function of the processed Triune God in indwelling our spirit as the law of the Spirit of life is to free us completely from Satan, who dwells in our fallen nature as the law of sin and of death (Rom. 7:23-25). The law of sin, the power to commit sin that arises spontaneously in man, causes man to become a slave of sin (John 8:34). Thus, man is helpless, is controlled and manipulated by sin, and does many things against his own will. The law of death, the natural power that causes man to become weak, to wither up, and to age and die, dwells in man and causes every part of man to enter into decay and death. When we fulfill the aforementioned requirements by walking according to the spirit and setting our mind on the spirit, the law of the Spirit of life sets us free continuously from the law of sin and of death.<p>As the law of the Spirit of life works in this way, the Spirit dispenses the Triune God with all His divine riches into our entire tripartite being. Eventually, this dispensing will become our spiritual constitution. We will be constituted of the divine elements through the dispensing work of the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>2. Giving Life to Our Mortal Bodies</h2><p>By His working in us, the Spirit continuously dispenses life to our mortal bodies. Romans 8:11 says, &#8220;The Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you...will also give life to your mortal bodies.&#8221; This verse reveals that as the life-giving Spirit dwells in us, that is, makes His home in us, He dispenses life not only into our spirits but even into our mortal bodies. Through this dispensing of life, our bodies are enlivened by the divine life.<p>Before we believed in the Lord, our spirit within was dead and our body without was alive. Now that we have Christ in us, though our body without is dead because of sin, our spirit within is life because of righteousness (v. 10). Christ&#8217;s coming into us as life exposes the dead situation of our body. In our spirit is Christ the Spirit as righteousness, resulting in life; but in our flesh is Satan as sin, resulting in death. Although God condemned sin in the flesh (v. 3), sin is not eradicated from man&#8217;s fallen body. Hence, our body is still dead.<p>The Bible reveals that, as human beings, we have three parts-the spirit, the soul, and the body. Romans 8 shows us that, first, through regeneration the Spirit enters into our spirit and causes our spirit to become life. Then, from our spirit the Spirit spreads to our mind and causes our mind to become life. Lastly, the Spirit dispenses life even to our mortal body and causes the body of sin to become the body of life. Thus, our entire being is filled with life, and we become people of life.<p>The accomplishment of this matter hinges on our mind (v. 6). When our mind is set on the regenerated spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit of God, our outward actions are in agreement with our inner man, and there is no discrepancy between us and God. He and we are at peace, not at enmity (v. 7). Thus, we feel peaceful within and the Spirit of the Triune God can make His home in us and have adequate room to settle down in us. Then in our experience we are in the spirit and are no longer in the flesh. Thus, the Triune God as the Spirit is able to spread from our spirit into our soul, represented by our mind (v. 6), and eventually He gives life even to our mortal body.<h2 class=head2>3. Putting to Death the Practices of Our Body</h2><p>The Spirit works in us also to put to death the practices of our body that we may live. Romans 8:13 says, &#8220;For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&#8221; This shows us that we must put to death the practices of our body, but we must do it by the Spirit. On one hand, we must take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body; the Spirit does not do it for us. On the other hand, we should not attempt to deal with our body by relying on our own effort without the power of the Holy Spirit. The putting to death here is actually our coordinating with the Spirit who indwells us. Inwardly, we must allow Him to make His home in us that He may give life to our mortal body (v. 11). Outwardly, we must put to death the practices of our body that we may live. When we take the initiative to put to death the practices of our body, the Spirit comes in to apply to those practices the effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s death, thus killing them. It is not the body itself but its practices that we must put to death. Our body needs to be redeemed (v. 23), but its practices need to be put to death. These practices include not only sinful things but also all things practiced by our body apart from the Spirit.<p>The word given in Romans 8:13 corresponds with verse 6, which says, &#8220;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&#8221; In order to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body, we need to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to the spirit. When we have our mind set on our spirit, we cooperate with the Spirit&#8217;s work to put to death all the practices of the body; thus, we have the genuine experience of the death of Christ. This does not happen once for all; rather, it is a constant, daily exercise. Furthermore, if we put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body, we will be able to present our bodies to God for the Body life (12:1) and thereby live in the Body of Christ in a practical way.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>In the fellowship of the Triune God we experience and enjoy the Spirit as the consummation of the Divine Trinity. First, the Spirit is the reality of Christ for our enjoyment. All that God is and has is embodied in Christ, and all that Christ is and has is received by the Spirit and declared as reality to us through the Spirit. Hence, when the Spirit is in us, it is Christ who is in us. The Spirit is in us not as the representative of Christ but as the reality of Christ. Next, the Spirit works in us, on us, and for us in many ways. He frees us by His law of life from the law of sin and of death, the power to commit sin that arises spontaneously in man and the natural power that causes man to become weak, to wither up, and to age and die. If we walk according to the spirit and set our mind on the spirit, the law of the Spirit of life will set us free continuously. The Spirit in us also continuously dispenses life into our mortal bodies. First, at the time of our regeneration, He enters into our spirit and causes our spirit to become life; then, from our spirit He spreads to our mind and causes our mind to become life; and, lastly, He dispenses life even into our mortal body and causes the body of sin to become the body of life. Thus, our entire being is filled with life and we become people of life. The Spirit in us also puts to death the practices of our body. This requires us to take the initiative to cooperate with the Spirit who indwells us. When we take the initiative to put to death the practices of our body, the Spirit comes in to apply to those practices the effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s death, thus killing them. In this way, we have the genuine experience of the death of Christ. This does not happen once for all; rather, it is a constant, daily exercise.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain how the Spirit as the consummation of the Divine Trinity is the reality of Christ.</li><li>How does the Spirit free us from the law of sin and of death by His law of life?</li><li>How does the Spirit work in us to dispense life into our mortal body?</li><li>How do we coordinate with the Spirit to put to death the practices of our body?</li></ol><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE SPIRIT AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Working in us, on us, and for us:	<ol class="decimal" start="4">	<li>Supplying us with His bountiful supply.</li>	<li>Leading us to live a life as sons of God.</li>	<li>Sanctifying us.</li>	<li>Transforming us.</li>	<li>Indwelling us.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head3>TEXT</h2><p>In this lesson we will continue to see the work of the Spirit in us.<h2 class=head2>4. Supplying Us with His Bountiful Supply</h2><p>In Philippians 1:19 Paul said, &#8220;I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&#8221; The Greek word rendered bountiful supply refers to the supplying of all the needs of the chorus in ancient times by the choragus, the leader of the chorus. The choragus supplied all the needs of everyone in the chorus, the needs for food, lodging, and musical instruments. Once a person had joined the chorus, there was no need for him to be concerned about the necessities of life. In using this expression Paul likened the supply of the Spirit, which is so bountiful, to the supply of the choragus. In the bountiful supply of the Spirit are the rich items such as the Lord&#8217;s divinity, His humanity, His human living, His death and its effectiveness, and His resurrection and its power. In his suffering for Christ, the apostle Paul experienced and enjoyed such a bountiful supply so that he was able to live Christ and magnify Christ. We also need to experience and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit today in all kinds of circumstances.<p>Because this verse speaks first of the saints&#8217; petition, then of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, this reveals that the bountiful supply of the compound Spirit is upon the Body of Christ. Although Paul was imprisoned, the imprisonment did not isolate him from the Body of Christ or cut him off from the supply of the Body. We also must be joined to the Body of Christ today that we may enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit which is for the Body.<h2 class=head2>5. Leading Us to Live a Life as Sons of God</h2><p>The Spirit also works in us by leading us to live a life as sons of God. Romans 8:14 says, &#8220;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&#8221; The leading here is not merely an action of the Spirit; it is the Triune God Himself becoming the leading in our spirit. If we would care for Him as a person who indwells us, we will spontaneously be led by Him. The leading by the Spirit is not outward but inward, and is composed of the law of the Spirit of life, the Spirit, and life. This verse speaks of our being led by the Spirit rather than of the Spirit&#8217;s leading us, indicating that although the Spirit is ready to lead us, we must take the initiative to be led by Him. This means that we must take Him as our life and everything and that we must put to death everything of the old creation in us. We do not need to seek after the Spirit&#8217;s leading, since it is already present within us, that is, in our regenerated spirit. As long as we live under this leading, we will walk and behave in a way that proves that we are God&#8217;s sons.<p>There is a great difference between the sons of God in this verse and the children of God in verse 16. Children are in the initial stage of sonship, the stage in which they are regenerated in their spirit. Sons are the children of God who are in the stage of the transformation of their souls. Not only have they been regenerated in their spirit and are growing in the divine life, but they are also walking by being led by the Spirit. Therefore, if we do not live and walk according to the leading of the Spirit, we may be the children of God concerning which the Spirit witnesses with our spirit (v. 16), but we do not have the mark that designates us as the sons of God. We may be God&#8217;s children, but we do not have the growth that comes by living and walking according to the leading of the Spirit in life. Therefore, we all need to go on in the growth in life from the initial stage of being children of God to the more advanced stage, showing that we are sons of God by receiving the leading of the Spirit in life and living the life as sons of God.<h2 class=head2>6. Sanctifying Us</h2><p>The Spirit works in us also to sanctify us. This is a very important aspect of the work of the Spirit. The Spirit&#8217;s sanctification in us is in three stages: first, the Spirit&#8217;s seeking us and convicting us at the time that He caused us to repent and believe (1 Pet. 1:2; John 16:8); second, His sanctifying us both positionally and dispositionally at the time we were saved (Heb. 13:12; 1 Cor. 6:11); and third, His sanctifying us dispositionally as we pursue the growth in life (Rom. 15:16). By these three stages of the Spirit&#8217;s sanctification, God&#8217;s salvation is applied to us that we may obtain and enjoy it fully. What we want to see in this lesson is the sanctification in the third stage.<p>Second Thessalonians 2:13 says, &#8220;God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.&#8221; Here, the sanctification of the Spirit is an all-inclusive revelation that consists of three stages. The three stages of the Spirit&#8217;s sanctification not only separate us from all old and negative things, making us holy unto God, but also sanctify us, making us a new creation that is full of the Lord&#8217;s essence and element, that we may obtain His glory (v. 14).<p>Romans 15:16 says, &#8220;That the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; According to the tone of this verse, the sanctification mentioned here is something accomplished gradually. This corresponds with what we saw earlier, that God&#8217;s sanctification in us is being carried out in three stages. Thus, sanctification here surely includes the third stage, the ultimate stage, of sanctification, which makes us acceptable to God by being transformed through sanctification. We must live in the Spirit, living and walking by Him and doing things and working according to Him, that we may enjoy the ultimate stage of sanctification.<h2 class=head2>7. Transforming Us</h2><p>The Spirit also works in us to transform us. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; The Lord, as both God and man, passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, entered into resurrection, accomplished full redemption, and became a life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, He dwells in us to make Himself and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us, that we may be one with Him and be transformed into the same image as the Lord from glory to glory.<p>In this verse &#8220;the Lord Spirit&#8221; may be considered a compound title like &#8220;the Father God&#8221; and &#8220;the Lord Christ.&#8221; This expression strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ. When our hearts are turned to the Lord, our faces are unveiled, we enjoy Him as the Spirit, and we are being transformed into His image by beholding and reflecting Him. Such transformation is a metabolic process. It is not an outward change, correction, or adjustment; it is altogether an inward replacing of the old element with the new element. The Holy Spirit is working in us to cause us to have a change in life, nature, essence, element, form, appearance, and every aspect of our being by dispensing the divine life, nature, element, and essence into us. This change is organic, for it is a change by the Lord Spirit. As the Lord Spirit works to transform us by the divine dispensing, He causes a metabolic, organic change to take place in our whole being.<p>Transformation is related to the Spirit&#8217;s work in sanctification. Transformation is the changing aspect of sanctification, and sanctification is the separating aspect of transformation. Before we were saved, we were in a fallen condition among sinners. One day the Holy Spirit came to find us and separate us unto God for His use to fulfill His purpose. However, our life, nature, element, essence, and even our whole being remained in the old creation. For this reason, when the Spirit separated us unto God, He also dispensed the divine life, nature, essence, and element-even the divine element-into us so that we may be transformed into the image of Christ. Therefore, we may say that transformation is an aspect of sanctification. Sanctification and transformation go together: Transformation depends on sanctification, and sanctification works for transformation.<h2 class=head2>8. Indwelling Us</h2><p>The Spirit also indwells us for God&#8217;s multifaceted purpose in us. Romans 8:9 and 11 say, &#8220;But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you....And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&#8221; This shows us that if the Spirit dwells in us, we are not in the flesh but in the spirit. Furthermore, He will be able to spread from our spirit (v. 10) to our soul (v. 6) and even give life to our mortal bodies in order to saturate and transform our whole being.<p>First Corinthians 3:16 says, &#8220;Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?&#8221; Then 6:19 says, &#8220;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?&#8221; These two verses show us that the temple of the Holy Spirit is of two aspects: the corporate temple, which is the church, and the individual temples, which are the believers&#8217; physical bodies. Both kinds of temples are for the Spirit&#8217;s indwelling so that He may dispense the Triune God into us individually and corporately.<p>Second Timothy 1:14 says, &#8220;Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.&#8221; This shows us that we need to guard the good deposit, the deposit of healthy words which the Lord has stored in us (v. 13), through the Spirit who dwells in us.<p>James 4:5 says, &#8220;The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy.&#8221; This shows us that the Spirit longs within us unto envy for God against worldliness that we not make friends with His enemy and be His lovers at the same time.<p>The above verses all show us that the Spirit dwells in us for the multifaceted purpose that our whole being may be saturated and transformed by Him, that we may become His dwelling place, that we may guard the Lord&#8217;s deposit in us, and that we may love God in singleness with our whole being.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>The Spirit works in us to supply us with His bountiful supply. In this bountiful supply are the rich items such as the Lord&#8217;s divinity, His humanity, His human living, His death and its effectiveness, and His resurrection and its power. The bountiful supply of the Spirit is upon the Body of Christ. Therefore, we must be joined to the Body of Christ that we may enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit. The Spirit also works in us by leading us to live a life as sons of God. This leading is not outward but inward, and is composed of the law of the Spirit of life, the Spirit, and life. As long as we live under this leading, we will walk and behave in a way that proves that we are God&#8217;s sons. The Spirit also sanctifies us. He not only separates us from all old and negative things, making us holy unto God, but also sanctifies us, making us a new creation that is full of the Lord&#8217;s essence and element, that we may obtain His glory. The Spirit transforms us, causing us to have a metabolic, organic change in every aspect of our being, by dispensing the divine life, nature, element, and essence into us. The Spirit also dwells in us for God&#8217;s multifaceted purpose in us that we may be saturated and transformed by Him, become His dwelling place, guard the Lord&#8217;s deposit in us, and love God in singleness with our whole being.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain the Spirit&#8217;s supplying us with His bountiful supply.</li><li>Briefly explain how the Spirit is leading us.</li><li>Briefly state the difference between children of God and sons of God.</li><li>Briefly state the three stages of the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying work in the believers.</li><li>Briefly explain how the Spirit is transforming us.</li><li>Briefly state the purpose of the Spirit&#8217;s indwelling us.</li></ol><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE SPIRIT AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Working in us, on us, and for us:	<ol class="decimal" start="9">	<li>As the means for us to know that God abides in us and we in God.</li>	<li>Filling us inwardly.</li>	<li>Teaching us.</li>	<li>Speaking in us.</li>	<li>Guiding us into all the reality.</li>	<li>Searching all things and revealing to us Christ as the depths of God.</li>	<li>Teaching us spiritual words for the interpretation of spiritual things.</li>	<li>Speaking with us.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head3>TEXT</h2><p>In this lesson we will continue to see the work of the Spirit in us.<h2 class=head2>9. As the Means for Us to Know That God Abides in Us and We in God</h2><p>First John 3:24 says, &#8220;In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&#8221; The phrase by the Spirit whom He gave to us modifies we know. Therefore, by the Spirit we know that God abides in us. It is by this Spirit that we are born of God, we receive the divine life as the divine seed in us, we have the fellowship of the divine life, we are anointed with the Triune God, and we abide in God. This wonderful Spirit is given to us as the promised blessing of the New Testament (Gal. 3:14). He is given without measure by the Christ who is above all, who inherits all, and who is to be increased without limit (John 3:31-35). This Spirit and the eternal life are the basic elements by which we live the life that abides in the Lord continually. Hence, it is by this Spirit, who witnesses with our spirit, that we are children of God (Rom. 8:16) and that we know that the Lord of all abides in us.<p>First John 4:13 says, &#8220;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.&#8221; In the fact that God has given to us of His Spirit, we know that we abide in Him and He in us. The Spirit, whom God has given to dwell in us, is the witness in our spirit (Rom. 8:16) that we dwell in God and He in us. The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God. When we experience and enjoy the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God, by the Spirit we are assured that God abides in us and we in God; that is, we are assured that we and God are one, that we abide in each other, indwelling each other mutually.<h2 class=head2>10. Filling Us Inwardly</h2><p>The Spirit not only indwells us but also fills us inwardly. A number of verses in Acts speak of this matter. Acts 13:52 says, &#8220;The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;filled&#8221; is pleroo, which means to be filled inwardly. Being filled inwardly and essentially with the Spirit is for our Christian life and living. Acts 6:3 says, &#8220;Look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;full&#8221; here is pleres, an adjective form of pleroo. Being full of the Spirit is the condition after one has been filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially. This also refers to life.<p>Acts 6:5 tells us that Stephen was &#8220;a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Acts 7:55 says that Stephen, &#8220;being full of the Holy Spirit,...looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.&#8221; These verses also refer to the inward filling of the Spirit. As Stephen was about to be martyred, he was filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially. Acts 11:24 says that Barnabas was a man &#8220;full of the Holy Spirit and of faith.&#8221; This refers also to a believer&#8217;s condition after being filled with the Spirit essentially.<p>By this we see that the inward filling of the Spirit is not for work or for ministry but for our existence and living. Hence, it is essential, not economical. The Spirit dispenses the Divine Trinity into us by filling us inwardly that we may experience and enjoy Him.<h2 class=head2>11. Teaching Us</h2><p>The Holy Spirit who dwells in us also teaches us. Luke 12:12 says, &#8220;The Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what should be said.&#8221; The Spirit&#8217;s teaching of the believers here is something particular. When we are persecuted, the Spirit within us always teaches us how to answer our persecutors. Therefore, we do not have to be anxious about how we should reply in defense or what we should say. We only need to be in our spirit and receive the Spirit&#8217;s teaching.<h2 class=head2>12. Speaking in Us</h2><p>In Matthew 10:16-33 the Lord Jesus speaks to the twelve apostles concerning persecution and the way to meet it. He tells them that when they are persecuted, they should &#8220;not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you&#8221; (vv. 19-20). This shows us how the Spirit speaks in the believers. The Lord&#8217;s word here corresponds with that in Luke 12:12, where He said that the Spirit will teach us what to say, as mentioned in the preceding point. When we are under persecution, the Spirit will teach us and speak in us. His speaking is His teaching.<p>As long as we have the Spirit, we have the presence of the Lord. The Spirit&#8217;s speaking in us is the Lord&#8217;s presence. In facing persecution we should turn to our spirit and trust the indwelling Spirit, believing that the Spirit is with us and that He will deal with the opposers and persecutors. We should face opposition and confront attack not in ourselves, but by turning to our spirit where the Spirit dwells. We need to trust in this indwelling Spirit, let Him lead us, and let Him speak for us.<h2 class=head2>13. Guiding Us into All the Reality</h2><p>John 16:13 says, &#8220;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.&#8221; This shows us that the Spirit works in the believers as the Spirit of reality to guide them into all the reality. This is to make all that the Son is and has real to the believers. All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9), and all that the Son is and has is declared as reality to the believers through the Spirit (John 16:14-15). This is a matter of the Triune God being wrought into and mingled with the believers.<p>According to the context, the reality in verse 13 refers to what the Father is and has, what the Son is and has, and what the Spirit receives of the Son and of the Father. What the Father is and has becomes the Son&#8217;s, what the Son is and has is received by the Spirit, and what the Spirit receives is declared to us and thereby becomes reality to us. Since what the Spirit receives is declared, transmitted, to us, we become the destination of the Triune God. We may say that the Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the Divine Trinity to us. Therefore, all the riches of the Triune God are imparted into us in the Spirit.<p>Through the Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God, the reality of the Divine Trinity is transmitted into us. This means that all the riches of what the processed Triune God is and has are dispensed into us to be our element and essence. In this way the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God makes the Triune God our portion. This is the Spirit for our experience and enjoyment in the fellowship of the Triune God by guiding us into all the reality.<h2 class=head2>14. Searching All Things and Revealing to Us Christ as the Depths of God</h2><p>First Corinthians 2:10 says, &#8220;But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.&#8221; God in His wisdom (that is, in Christ) has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification. All these the human eye has never seen, the human ear has never heard, and the human heart has never realized (v. 9). But they are revealed to us in our spirit by God&#8217;s Spirit. In this verse the Greek word rendered searches is used in reference to active research, implying accurate knowledge gained not by discovering but by exploring. The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation.<p>Therefore, to realize the deep and hidden things God has prepared for us, our spirit is more necessary than our mind. When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion. This is to reveal the deep things planned by God&#8217;s wisdom concerning Christ, things which have never come up in man&#8217;s heart.<h2 class=head2>15. Teaching Us Spiritual Words for the Interpretation of Spiritual Things</h2><p>First Corinthians 2:13 says, &#8220;Which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words.&#8221; The thought here is to speak spiritual things with spiritual words. The stress is not on the person to whom the speaking is done but on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken. The apostle spoke the spiritual things, which are the deep things of God concerning Christ, with spiritual words, which are the spiritual words taught by the Spirit. He did not speak the spiritual things in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit. He did not speak in words of Greek philosophy or wisdom. Rather, he interpreted spiritual things with spiritual words.<p>In this verse, the same Greek word is used for spiritual things and spiritual words. Paul uses the same term with two meanings. On the one hand, it refers to the spiritual things themselves; on the other hand, it refers to spiritual words. Therefore, we may say that spiritual things are designated and interpreted with spiritual words. These spiritual words are spiritual things used to designate spiritual things. The speaking that is according to man&#8217;s wisdom is not spiritual. But the words taught by the Spirit of God are truly spiritual things. Thus, spiritual things are both the things given to us by God concerning Christ as our portion and also the words taught by the Spirit of God. Paul spoke such spiritual things by spiritual things. When we live in the fellowship of the Triune God, the Spirit will also teach us spiritual words for the interpretation of spiritual things.<h2 class=head2>16. Speaking with Us</h2><p>The matter of the Spirit&#8217;s speaking with the believers is clearly seen in 1 Corinthians 7. Paul&#8217;s teaching in this chapter is very different from that of the prophets in the Old Testament. When the prophets spoke for God in Old Testament times, the word of Jehovah came to them and then was spoken forth through them. Often the prophets would say, &#8220;Thus saith Jehovah.&#8221; But it is not so in the New Testament time. In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul&#8217;s teaching is based on the principle of incarnation, that God speaks in man&#8217;s speaking. Although certain things Paul said here are not the Lord&#8217;s commandment (v. 25), they have nonetheless become part of the divine revelation in the New Testament. This is because Paul was a person absolutely one with God, so when he spoke, the Lord spoke with him.<p>In 1 Corinthians 7:40 Paul said, &#8220;She is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&#8221; In verse 10 he said, &#8220;I charge, not I but the Lord.&#8221; In verse 12 he said, &#8220;I say, I, not the Lord.&#8221; In verse 25 he said, &#8220;I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion.&#8221; In verse 40 he summarized by saying, &#8220;I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&#8221; This clearly indicates that all the words spoken by Paul in this chapter are the speaking of the Spirit with Paul. Paul did not speak by himself; he spoke together with the Spirit. The Spirit&#8217;s word became his word. Hence, his charge was the Lord&#8217;s charge (v. 10). He was one with the Lord, who is the Spirit, to such a degree that even when he gave his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord, he thought that he also had the Spirit of God. He did not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he thought that he also had the Spirit of God. This is the highest spirituality. The Spirit&#8217;s work in us is also to bring us to the realm of such a height that we may be absolutely one with Him and that He may speak with us in our speaking.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>The Spirit as the means by which we know that God abides in us and we in Him is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding of us and God that we may be assured that we and God are one, that we abide in each other, indwelling each other mutually. The Spirit in us also fills us essentially to dispense the Divine Trinity into us for our existence and living. When we are persecuted, the Spirit within us also teaches us how to answer our persecutors. The Spirit also guides us into all the reality. This is to declare, to transmit, to us all that the Father is and has, all that the Son is and has, and all that the Spirit receives of the Son and of the Father as our element and essence. The Spirit also explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows us all the secrets of Christ as our portion for our realization and participation. The Spirit also teaches us spiritual words for the interpretation of spiritual things, the things given to us by God concerning Christ as our portion. The Spirit also speaks with us. He works in us to such an extent that we may be absolutely one with Him that He may speak with us in our speaking.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>How do we know that God abides in us and we in Him?</li><li>Give some cases of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s filling of the believers inwardly.

Comforting Us</h2><p>Acts 9:31 says, &#8220;The church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied.&#8221; This indicates that the church was suffering affliction through the persecutions, in which she feared the Lord and enjoyed the comfort of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit&#8217;s work in comforting us is a matter of the divine dispensing. When we live in the fellowship of the Triune God, He dispenses Himself into us that we may be comforted and encouraged by the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>18. Giving Us Joy</h2><p>Romans 14:17 says, &#8220;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; First Thessalonians 1:6 also tells us that the believers &#8220;received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; These two verses show that the Holy Spirit is a Spirit of joy. Our inward, genuine love comes from the indwelling Spirit. The overcoming life that we live in the church today is the kingdom life, which is constituted of the joy of the Holy Spirit with righteousness and peace. If we are righteous and right toward others and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God. Thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit, proving that we are living in the reality of God&#8217;s kingdom and are under God&#8217;s rule and thereby have the practical church life. In Matthew 5, 6, and 7, in the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens and the portrayal of the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens (5:1-12), the Lord Jesus concluded with this word: &#8220;Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens.&#8221; This tells us that joy is an evidence of our living in the reality of the kingdom.<p>We need to rejoice, but it does not mean that we wait for some pleasant things to happen for us to rejoice. The indwelling Lord is the cause of our rejoicing, and the Holy Spirit who moves within us is the motivation of our constant rejoicing. If we live in the fellowship of the Triune God and experience and enjoy the Spirit, we will have the joy that is brought to us by the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>19. Empowering Us to Abound in Hope</h2><p>Romans 15:13 says, &#8220;Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The Spirit not only brings us joy but also empowers us that we may abound in hope. Our hope is to be brought into the glory of God, His expression. This will be fully fulfilled in the coming millennial kingdom, where Christ will be manifested as our glory. If we experience and enjoy the Holy Spirit in His power, we will be in the hope in the coming glory.<h2 class=head2>20. Giving Us Love</h2><p>Romans 15:30 speaks of the love of the Spirit; Colossians 1:4 refers to the love which the saints in Colossae had unto all the saints, and verse 8 tells us that their love to all the saints was the love in the Spirit. These verses show that because of the indwelling Spirit, we have love toward all the saints in Christ, and that the Spirit is the source, the element, and the sphere of such love. As we live by the Spirit, He gives us a love for all the different members of the Lord&#8217;s Body so that we can love the brothers in the Lord from all cultures, races, and countries. This is not possible by our natural love.<h2 class=head2>21. Pouring Out God&#8217;s Love in Our Hearts</h2><p>Romans 5:5 says, &#8220;The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.&#8221; The love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16). God has poured out this love in our hearts with the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us, as the motivating power within us, that we may more than conquer in all our tribulations. Therefore, when we endure any kind of tribulation, we are not put to shame.<p>From the day we first called on the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit. This means that the Spirit confirms and assures us with the love of God. The indwelling Spirit assures us that God loves us. Although we may be afflicted, we cannot deny the presence of God&#8217;s love within us. Christ died for ungodly sinners such as we and shed His blood on the cross to redeem us and reconcile us to God. What love is this! Whenever we are in the fellowship of the Triune God, by participating in and enjoying the Spirit, we can realize afresh that God loves us and that His love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>22. Mingling with Our Spirit in Our Faith</h2><p>Second Corinthians 4:13 says, &#8220;And having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written, &#8216;I believed, therefore I spoke,&#8217; we also believe, therefore we also speak.&#8221; The same spirit refers to the same spirit as set forth in the quotation in this verse from Psalm 116:10. We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak, like the psalmist, the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection. Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind. Doubts are in our mind. Here spirit indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for the carrying out of their ministry.<p>If we would have the boldness to speak concerning Christ and of our experience of Christ in His death and resurrection, we need the spirit of faith. This spirit is the mingling of the Holy Spirit and the human spirit. As long as we have this mingled spirit, we will have faith and the boldness to speak to others about our experience of Christ. Whenever we are in our spirit, practicing to be one spirit with Him, we will have the spirit of faith, for the indwelling Spirit will be mingled with our spirit in our faith.<h2 class=head2>23. As the Means for God the Father to Strengthen Us into Our Inner Man</h2><p>The indwelling Spirit is the means for God the Father to strengthen us into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts. In Ephesians 3:16-17 Paul prayed that the Father would &#8220;grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; This shows that it is through the Spirit that the Father strengthens us. When the Father works in us, He works through the Spirit, and the Spirit&#8217;s working in us is the Father&#8217;s working, for the Spirit comes from and with the Father (John 15:26) and He is the consummation of the Divine Trinity (2 Cor. 13:14). By the Spirit the Father is continually strengthening us into the inner man.<p>The inner man is our regenerated spirit, which has God&#8217;s life as its life. It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), indwelt by the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:11, 16), and mingled with the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 6:17). In order to experience Christ unto all the fullness of God, we need to be strengthened by God the Father into our inner man through the Holy Spirit. In this way, Christ will be able to make His home in our hearts, control our entire inward being, and supply and strengthen every inward part with Himself. This is the supreme result of our allowing the Spirit to work in us and for us as we experience and enjoy the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>24. By Him We Live and Walk</h2><p>The Spirit in us is for us to live and walk by Him. Galatians 5:16 says, &#8220;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&#8221; According to the context of chapter five, the Spirit here must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit. To walk by the Spirit is to have our walk regulated by the Holy Spirit from within our spirit. This is in contrast to having our walk regulated by the law in the realm of the flesh. The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man (Gen. 6:3), and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God (John 7:39). Because of Christ&#8217;s redemption and the Spirit&#8217;s work of regeneration, we who have received God&#8217;s dispensing can walk by the Spirit, by the processed Triune God, instead of by the flesh, by our fallen being. In Greek, the word walk in this verse means to tread all around, to walk at large; hence, to deport oneself, move, and act in ordinary daily life, implying a common, habitual daily walk. In this verse Paul charged us to have our daily life by the Spirit that we may by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.<p>In verse 25 of Galatians 5 Paul went on to say, &#8220;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&#8221; To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent on and regulated by the Spirit, not by the law. This equals the walk by the Spirit in verse 16. The Greek word for live in this verse implies both to have life and to live. Hence, Paul&#8217;s concept here is that, since we have life and live by the Spirit, our walk should also be by the Spirit. Literally, walk in this verse is &#8220;walk according to rules.&#8221; The Greek word means to observe the elements, to walk according to the elements, e.g., to walk in line, to march in military rank, to keep in step; and, derivatively, to walk in an orderly, regulated manner.<p>In Galatians 5:16 and 25 Paul used two different Greek words for walk. Both kinds of walk are by the Spirit and are regulated by the Spirit. However, the former refers to a general, daily walk; the latter, to a walk that takes God&#8217;s unique goal as the direction and purpose of life, and a walk that follows the Spirit as the elementary rule, the basic principle. Every believer should have these two kinds of walk by the Spirit. In the first kind of walk by the Spirit, we live, have our being, and walk about by the Spirit. This walk is a support to the second walk, a walk with a direction toward a goal. For the first kind of walk, the Spirit is our essence; for the second kind, the Spirit is our way. The Spirit Himself is the way, the rule, the line, leading to God&#8217;s goal. If we live in the fellowship of the Triune God and take the Spirit as our essence and our way, we will surely reach the goal.<h2 class=head2>25. Fighting for Us against the Flesh</h2><p>As the Spirit works in us, He fights for us against the flesh. Galatians 5:17 says, &#8220;The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other.&#8221; This verse indicates that there is a war between the flesh and the Spirit, that the flesh and the Spirit oppose each other. The flesh lusts against the Spirit for its own desire, and the Spirit fights against the flesh for God&#8217;s purpose. If we are in ourselves, we will not be able to defeat the flesh; rather, we will be taken captive by the flesh (Rom. 7:23). Therefore, we need to be in the fellowship of the Triune God to experience and enjoy the Spirit. Then He will fight for us against the flesh that we may be delivered from the works of the flesh and live and walk by the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>26. Bearing the Fruit of Life in Many Aspects in Our Life</h2><p>Galatians 5:22-23 shows us that the Spirit works in the believers to bear the fruit of life in many aspects in their life: &#8220;The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control.&#8221; What the flesh does is works without life (v. 19); what the Spirit brings forth is fruit full of life. The fruit of the Spirit, as different expressions of the Spirit who is life within us, is listed here with only nine items as illustrations. It has more expressions, such as lowliness (Eph. 4:2; Phil. 2:3), compassion (Phil. 2:1), godliness (2 Pet. 1:6), righteousness (Rom. 14:17; Eph. 5:9), holiness (Eph. 1:4; Col. 1:22), purity (Matt. 5:8), and other virtues. These are also the fruit brought forth by the Spirit in many aspects in our life.<p>As the flesh is the expression of the old Adam, so the Spirit is the realization of Christ. Christ is actually lived out as the Spirit. The items of the fruit of the Spirit listed here are the very characteristics of Christ. We need to differentiate between our natural virtues and the fruit of the Spirit. The natural virtues do not have anything of the Spirit, whereas the fruit of the Spirit is full of the substance and element of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit is the result of the believers&#8217; walking by the Spirit. We need simply to live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit, and then the fruit of the Spirit will be brought forth automatically.<h2 class=head2>27. Longing within Us to Envy for God against Worldliness</h2><p>The Spirit within us longs to envy for God against worldliness. James 4:4-5 says, &#8220;Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: &#8216;The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy&#8217;?&#8221; Here James used marriage to illustrate our relationship with God. The Bible indicates in many places that God and Christ are our Husband (Isa. 54:5; 2 Cor. 11:2). We should be chaste and love Him alone with our entire being (Mark 12:30). If our heart is divided by loving the world, we become adulteresses.<p>When God acquired us to be His spouse, He put His Spirit into us to make us one with Him (1 Cor. 6:19, 16-17) that He may occupy our entire being (cf. Eph. 3:17) for God, causing us to be wholly for our Husband. God is a jealous God (Exo. 20:5), and His Spirit is jealous over us with the jealousy of God (2 Cor. 11:2), longing, jealously desiring, that we will not be His lover and make friends with His enemy at the same time. For this reason, the Spirit works within us to separate us from everything other than God and to keep us for God Himself only. The Spirit works in this way also to dispense into us the Triune God as the unique element that we may be sanctified and transformed.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>Through His divine dispensing, the Spirit in us comforts and encourages us in our suffering of afflictions. He also gives us joy. The overcoming life that we live in the church today is the kingdom life, which is constituted of the joy of the Holy Spirit with righteousness and peace. If we are righteous and right toward others and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God. Thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, the Spirit empowers us that we may abound in hope and be brought into the glory of God. He also gives us love that we can love all the saints in Christ. He also pours out God&#8217;s love in our hearts so that we are confirmed and assured concerning God&#8217;s love. He also mingles with our spirit in our faith, issuing in the spirit of faith. In this spirit we have the boldness to speak concerning Christ and our experience of Christ in His death and resurrection. He is the means for God the Father to strengthen us into our inner man. Thus, Christ makes His home in our hearts to control our entire inward being and supply and strengthen every inward part with Himself. The Spirit is also for us to live and walk by Him. By Him we have not only a general, daily walk, but also a walk that takes God&#8217;s unique goal as the direction and purpose of life. For the first kind of walk, the Spirit is our essence; for the second kind, the Spirit is our way. If we take the Spirit as our essence and our way, we will surely reach God&#8217;s goal. The Spirit also fights for us against the flesh that we may be delivered from the works of the flesh and live and walk by the Spirit. He also bears the fruit of life in many aspects in our life, such as love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, and goodness. This is the result of our living and walking by the Spirit. He also longs within us to envy for God against worldliness that He may separate us from everything other than God and keep us for Himself only.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the significance of the Spirit&#8217;s giving us love and His pouring out of God&#8217;s love in our hearts.</li><li>Briefly state the result of God the Father&#8217;s strengthening us into our inner man through the Spirit.</li><li>Briefly explain the two kinds of walk by the Spirit mentioned in Galatians 5.</li><li>Briefly state the fruit of life brought forth by the Spirit within us.</li><li>How does the Spirit within us long to envy for God against worldliness?</li></ol><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE SPIRIT AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(5)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Working in us, on us, and for us:	<ol class="decimal" start="28">	<li>As the sword for our fighting.</li>	<li>Not to be grieved by us.</li>	<li>Not to be quenched by us.</li>	<li>Not to be insulted by us.</li>	<li>As the means for us to pray.</li>	<li>Helping us in our weakness.</li>	<li>Interceding for us with groanings in us.</li>	<li>Infusing His according-to-God mind into us in our prayer.</li>	<li>As the means for us to guard the good deposit.</li>	<li>Unto Him we sow and of Him we reap in our life.</li>	<li>Confessing to us that Christ came in the flesh.</li>	<li>Testifying together with the water and the blood that Christ is the Son of God.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head3>TEXT</h2><p>In this lesson we will continue to see the different aspects of the Spirit&#8217;s work within us.<h2 class=head2>28. As the Sword for Our Fighting</h2><p>The Spirit is the sword for us to fight against our spiritual enemies, the power of darkness, and the evil things. In Ephesians 6:10-20, concerning the warfare that deals with the spiritual enemies by putting on the whole armor of God, Paul said that we need to receive &#8220;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God&#8221; (v. 17). Among the six items of God&#8217;s armor, only the sword is for attacking the enemy. Here it shows us that the sword, the Spirit, and the word are one. The word is the Bible. But if this word is only printed letters, it is neither the Spirit nor the sword. When the constant word in the Bible becomes the instant word, this word is the Spirit, who is the sword for slaying the enemy. If we would enjoy the Spirit as the sword for fighting against the enemy, we must come to the word of the Bible, receiving the word of God by means of all prayer. By praying and taking the word of God in this way, we enjoy the Spirit as the sword for fighting to slay all the things that resist us.<h2 class=head2>29. Not to Be Grieved by Us</h2><p>The Spirit who is within us and who is working for us should not be grieved by us. Ephesians 4:30 says, &#8220;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.&#8221; To grieve the Holy Spirit is to displease Him. Once He comes into us, the Holy Spirit abides in us forever (John 14:16-17), and He will never leave us. Therefore, He is grieved when we do not walk according to Him (Rom. 8:4), that is, when we do not take Christ as reality nor have Christ as grace in the details of our daily walk. Sometimes when we feel unhappy, that feeling of unhappiness is actually the feeling of the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, when He feels happy within us, we are happy also. If we take Christ as reality and have Christ as grace, we will make the Holy Spirit happy, and He will give us joy. Therefore, we should take care of the Holy Spirit in us and not cause Him to be grieved.<h2 class=head2>30. Not to Be Quenched by Us</h2><p>The Spirit in us should not be quenched by us. First Thessalonians 5:19 says, &#8220;Do not quench the Spirit.&#8221; The Spirit causes our spirit to be burning (Rom. 12:11) and our gifts to be flaming (2 Tim. 1:6). Hence, we should not quench Him. The Christian life is a life inspired and stirred up by the Spirit. Throughout the day we should have the Spirit inspiring us, stirring us, and moving and acting within us. Thus, instead of quenching the Spirit, we need to fan the Spirit in us into flame that He may burn in us.<h2 class=head2>31. Not to Be Insulted by Us</h2><p>The Spirit within us who gives grace to us should not be insulted by us. Hebrews 10:29 warns the Hebrew believers not to insult the Spirit of grace. Under the new covenant, through the redeeming blood of Christ, the Hebrew believers had become partakers of the Holy Spirit (6:4), the Spirit of grace. If they had returned to Judaism to offer sacrifices for their sins, they would have been contradicting the work of the Spirit of grace; that is, they would have been sinning willfully to insult the Spirit of grace, who dwelled in them and worked in them. This is a very serious matter. In the church life we should not contradict the work of the Spirit of grace and fall to the extent of insulting the Holy Spirit, thereby suffering serious loss.<p>Instead of grieving, quenching, or insulting the Spirit, we should experience and enjoy Him positively as the consummation of the Triune God. Then, through the work of the indwelling Spirit, we will feel happy, released, and glorious.<h2 class=head2>32. As the Means for Us to Pray</h2><p>Jude 20 says, &#8220;But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The Spirit is the means for us to pray, and to pray is to have fellowship with the Triune God. By prayer we are preserved in our fellowship with the Triune God. The Spirit is the element and sphere of our prayer. When we pray by this element and in this sphere, we experience and enjoy the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God.<p>According to this verse, if we would build up ourselves upon our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit. On the foundation of this holy faith, and in the sphere of it, by praying in the Holy Spirit, we build up ourselves. The truth of the faith in our apprehension and the Holy Spirit enjoyed through our prayer are necessary for our building up. We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves upon our most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit; thus, we await and look for the mercy of our Lord that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age but also inherit it for eternity (v. 21; Matt. 19:29).<h2 class=head2>33. Helping Us in Our Weakness</h2><p>Romans 8:26a says, &#8220;In like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness.&#8221; In particular, weakness here is our weakness in prayer. Prayer exposes our weakness. It is not easy for us to pray. We may have the energy to do many other things, but we may not have the energy needed to pray. Even if we have the desire to pray, we may not have the energy, strength, and ability to carry out our desire. This indicates that we are weak in God&#8217;s interests and in the divine things. Therefore, the indwelling Spirit works in us to help us in our weakness.<p>In this verse, the phrase &#8220;in like manner&#8221; includes matters covered in foregoing verses such as awaiting, eagerness, groaning, endurance, and hope. While we are groaning, the Holy Spirit also is groaning. While we are expecting, He is expecting. While we are hoping and enduring, He is hoping and enduring. Whatever we are, He is also the same. In like manner the Spirit joins in to help us. What a comfort this is! If we are weak, He apparently is weak also, although actually He is not. He sympathizes with our weakness. He appears to be weak for the sake of our weakness in order to participate in it. He participates in our weakness in order to help us and to join in our manner.<h2 class=head2>34. Interceding for Us with Groanings in Us</h2><p>Romans 8:26b says, &#8220;We do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.&#8221; When we are weak, unable to pray, the Spirit comes in to strengthen us. Then we are able to pray. However, although we may be burdened to pray, we may not know what to say and can only groan. This is the groaning of the Spirit within us. The Spirit intercedes for us with groanings in our manner. This groaning apparently is our groaning, but in our groaning is the groaning of the Spirit. He is in us, and He groans in the same manner as our groaning. He groans together with us. When we have a real burden to pray, yet we do not know how to utter it, then spontaneously we may groan. This is the best prayer within which the Spirit intercedes for us by groaning together with us.<p>This kind of unutterable prayer is primarily for the growth in life. Concerning our material needs and business affairs we are clear and have the utterance to pray about them. But concerning the matter of our growth in life we are lacking in both understanding and utterance. We do not know the kind of prayer God desires, and we are not clear how to pray, according to the burden we feel, for our being conformed to the image of God&#8217;s Son; hence, we groan. In our groaning, the Spirit groans also, interceding for us. His interceding is mainly that we may experience the transformation in life for growth into the maturity of sonship that we may be fully conformed to the image of God&#8217;s Son.<h2 class=head2>35. Infusing His According-to-God Mind into Us in Our Prayer</h2><p>As the Spirit works in us by helping us in our weakness and by interceding for us with groanings, He infuses His according-to-God mind into us in our prayer. Romans 8:27 says, &#8220;He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God.&#8221; God&#8217;s desire is that we may be conformed to the image of His Son and be brought into His glory. As we do not know how to pray concerning the growth in life, we groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting the divine sonship. Then the Spirit not only groans with us in our prayer, interceding for us, but also mingles with us by infusing His according-to-God mind into us in our prayer.<h2 class=head2>36. As the Means for Us to Guard the Good Deposit</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 1:14 Paul charged Timothy, saying, &#8220;Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.&#8221; According to the preceding verse, verse 13, the deposit here must refer to the deposit of healthy words, including the riches of life in His word, which the Lord has stored in us. From the time we were saved, we have received many things from God as a deposit, like a deposit in a bank. Within us, and especially within our spirit, we have a divine deposit from the Lord. God&#8217;s life, God&#8217;s Spirit, and all the precious truths we have seen in the Lord&#8217;s recovery have been deposited into our being. How can we guard this deposit? We can guard this deposit only through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. If we act, behave, and have our life in the Spirit, all that has been deposited into us will be guarded. But if we neglect the Spirit and walk in the flesh and according to our mind, there will not be any guarding of the good things that have been deposited into our being. For this reason, we need to exercise our spirit and be preserved in fellowship with the Triune God; then we shall have a care for all the things that have been deposited into our being.<h2 class=head2>37. Unto Him We Sow and of Him We Reap in Our Life</h2><p>Galatians 6:8 says, &#8220;He who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.&#8221; To sow unto the flesh is to sow for one&#8217;s own flesh, with the desire and purpose of the flesh in view, to fulfill what the flesh covets. To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires. To sow for the fulfilling of the purpose of the flesh issues in corruption; to sow for the accomplishing of the aim of the Spirit issues in life, even eternal life. Corruption is of the flesh, indicating that the flesh is corrupted; eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself. Sowing includes the totality of our Christian life. Everything we do is a sowing, either unto our own flesh or unto the Spirit, and our sowing issues in a reaping either of corruption out of the flesh, or of eternal life out of the Spirit.<p>This verse shows us clearly that the flesh is in contrast to the Spirit, and corruption is in contrast to eternal life. As far as we are concerned, there are only two kinds of sowing and two kinds of reaping. Sowing unto the flesh will always produce a harvest of corruption, whereas sowing unto the Spirit will always produce a harvest of eternal life. This word strongly implies that we need to make a decision with respect to our aim, our goal. To sow unto the flesh is to have the flesh as the goal, but to sow unto the Spirit is to have the Spirit as our goal. Thus, the Spirit should be not only our life and walk but also the goal of our living. Whatever we do, we do with a view toward this goal. We need to take the Spirit as our unique and eternal goal and keep ourselves continually in the fellowship of the Triune God that we may sow unto the Spirit and of the Spirit reap eternal life.<h2 class=head2>38. Confessing to Us That Christ Came in the Flesh</h2><p>The Spirit works in us to confess to us that Christ came in the flesh. First John 4:2 says, &#8220;In this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God.&#8221; This shows us that the discernment of spirits is based upon whether or not a spirit confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. The spirit of any genuine prophet motivated by the Holy Spirit of truth will confess the divine conception of Jesus and affirm that He was born as the Son of God. Christ is God incarnate to become a man through divine conception. His conception is divine because it was carried out by the Holy Spirit. However, this conception took place in the womb of a virgin. Therefore, He, the very God, became a man in the flesh. Because He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception.<p>When we are kept in the divine fellowship of the Triune God, the Spirit will show us, will confess to us, that the Lord Jesus who came in the flesh is still a man after His death and resurrection (Luke 24:39; Acts 7:56). Therefore, in the divine fellowship we may continually enjoy Him as God and as a man, especially as the One who, in His humanity, can sympathize with our weaknesses and problems. In our fellowship with the Divine Trinity, the Third, the Spirit, confesses, testifies, that the Second, who is the Lord Jesus, is still a man. The Spirit&#8217;s confessing to us of the humanity of the Lord Jesus is truly a comfort.<h2 class=head2>39. Testifying Together with the Water and the Blood That Christ Is the Son of God</h2><p>On the one hand, the Spirit confesses Christ&#8217;s humanity, that He has come in the flesh; on the other hand, the Spirit confesses Christ&#8217;s divinity, that He is the Son of God. First John 5:6 says, &#8220;This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the reality.&#8221; According to the context of this verse, Jesus, the man of Nazareth, was attested to be the Son of God by the water He went through in His baptism (Matt. 3:16-17; John 1:31), by the blood He shed on the cross (John 19:31-35; Matt. 27:50-54), and also by the Spirit He gave not by measure (John 1:32-34; 3:34). By these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us, that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing into His name (John 3:16, 36; 20:31). The water of baptism terminates people of the old creation by burying them; the blood shed on the cross redeems those whom God has chosen from among the old creation; and the Spirit, who is the truth, the reality in life (Rom. 8:2), germinates those whom God has redeemed out of the old creation by regenerating them with the divine life. By the three steps of termination, redemption, and germination, Jesus Christ has not only been testified of as the Son of God but has also entered into our spirit. Now the Spirit is working in us to preserve us in the fellowship of the Triune God that we may enjoy the humanity of the Lord Jesus and also His divinity.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>The Spirit is the sword for us to fight against our spiritual enemies, the power of darkness, and the evil things. When the constant word in the Bible becomes the instant word, this word is the Spirit, who is the sword. When we receive the word of God by means of all prayer, we enjoy the Spirit as the sword for slaying all the things that resist us. We should take care of the Holy Spirit in us and not grieve Him. We should not quench the Spirit; instead, we need to fan the Spirit in us that He may burn in us. Furthermore, we should not insult the Spirit nor contradict the work of the Spirit of grace. We should take the Spirit as the means for us to pray that we may be preserved to experience and enjoy Him in our fellowship with the Triune God. The Spirit also helps us in our weakness in prayer and intercedes for us with groanings. Although we have the desire to pray, we may not have the energy needed to pray. Therefore, He works in us to help us in our weakness. Furthermore, although we may be burdened to pray, we may not know what to say and can only groan. The Spirit intercedes for us with groanings in our manner. He also mingles with us by infusing His according-to-God mind into us in our prayer. The Spirit is also the means for us to guard the good deposit that we may be able to guard the healthy words and the riches of life in the word, which the Lord has deposited in us. In our living we should sow to accomplish what the Spirit desires and not sow to fulfill what the flesh covets, that we may have a reaping of eternal life of the Spirit. The Spirit works in us, on the one hand, to confess to us the humanity of Christ, to confess that He came in the flesh, and on the other hand, to confess the divinity of Christ, testifying together with the water and the blood that Christ is the Son of God.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>How do we experience the Spirit as the sword for fighting?</li><li>What is the main thing referred to concerning the Spirit&#8217;s helping us in our weakness?</li><li>How does the Spirit intercede for us with groanings in us?</li><li>Briefly explain the Spirit&#8217;s being the means for us to guard the good deposit.</li><li>Briefly state the difference between sowing unto our flesh and sowing unto the Spirit.</li><li>Briefly explain the Spirit&#8217;s testifying together with the water and the blood that Christ is the Son of God.</li></ol><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE SPIRIT AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(6)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Working in us, on us, and for us:	<ol class="decimal" start="40">	<li>As the means for us to take Christ as our righteousness by faith.</li>	<li>Witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God.</li>	<li>Crying with our spirit, &#8220;Abba, Father.&#8221;</li>	<li>Bearing witness in our conscience.</li>	<li>Anointing us.</li>	<li>Sealing us.</li>	<li>Pledging in us.</li>	<li>Being the firstfruits of our divine inheritance.</li>	<li>Being the access for us to draw near to the Triune God.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head3>TEXT</h2><p>In this lesson we will continue to see the Spirit&#8217;s work in us.<h2 class=head2>40. As the Means for Us to Take Christ as Our Righteousness by Faith</h2><p>Galatians 5:5 says, &#8220;We by the Spirit out of faith eagerly await the hope of righteousness.&#8221; By the Spirit here is in contrast to by the flesh (3:3), and out of faith is in contrast to out of the works of law (3:2). Our hope of righteousness is Christ Himself (1 Cor. 1:30). It is not out of the works of law in the flesh but out of faith in the Spirit. We do not have our own merit before God. Our only merit is Christ. It is by the Spirit and by faith that we await Christ as the hope of righteousness. Now in the divine fellowship, through the Spirit and by faith we have Christ as the righteousness that we live out daily.<h2 class=head2>41. Witnessing with Our Spirit That We Are the Children of God</h2><p>Romans 8:16 says, &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&#8221; This is the witnessing of the Spirit when we cry &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; (v. 15). Such a witnessing testifies to us and assures us that we are the children of God, who possess His life; it also limits us and restricts us to a living and walk that are according to this life, in keeping with our being children of God. Moreover, it is not only that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also; rather, it is that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. This indicates that our spirit must take the initiative to witness first; then the Spirit will witness with our spirit. This also reveals that the Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit. These two spirits are one; they live together, work together, and exist together as one mingled spirit. Hence, the indwelling Spirit&#8217;s witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God is a matter of the divine fellowship. When we enjoy the supply of the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God, we have the sweet and intimate inward sense that we are God&#8217;s children.<h2 class=head2>42. Crying with Our Spirit, &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221;</h2><p>The Spirit not only witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God but also cries with our spirit, &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221; Galatians 4:6 says, &#8220;Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&#8221; God gave His Spirit to us when we were regenerated to become sons of God. Romans 8:15 says that we &#8220;have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father!&#8221; The spirit of sonship here denotes our regenerated human spirit mingled with the Spirit of the Son of God. Sonship in this spirit includes the life, the position, the living, the enjoyment, the birthright, the inheritance, and the manifestation of a son. Such a Spirit with the all-inclusive sonship, which is also the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son, is now in our spirit and cries with our spirit, &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221;<p>Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6 are parallel verses. The former says that we who have received a spirit of sonship cry in this spirit, &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221; whereas the latter says that the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son is crying in our hearts, &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221; This indicates that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of God are mingled as one, and that our spirit is in our heart. When we cry, &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221; He cries with us in our crying. Such a crying expresses our strong affection to the Father; it also implies an intimate relationship in life between us and God our Father. When we are in the fellowship of the Triune God, the Spirit brings us into the enjoyment and experience of such sweetness and intimacy.<h2 class=head2>43. Bearing Witness in Our Conscience</h2><p>As the Spirit works in us, He bears witness in our conscience. In Romans 9:1 Paul said, &#8220;I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here it says that our conscience bears witness with us in the Holy Spirit, whereas Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. This proves that our conscience is in our human spirit. The Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is indwelling our spirit and is mingled with our spirit, and our conscience is a part of our human spirit. Hence, the spirit is mingled with our conscience. When we live in the fellowship of the Triune God and speak, walk, and behave by the Spirit, the Spirit bears witness with us in our conscience.<h2 class=head2>44. Anointing Us</h2><p>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, &#8220;The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&#8221; This shows us that God establishes the apostles with the believers in Christ. This means that God firmly attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One, through the anointing Spirit, that the apostles and the believers may also be anointed with Christ by God.<p>Two verses in 1 John refer to the work of the Spirit in anointing the believers. First John 2:20 says, &#8220;You have an anointing from the Holy One.&#8221; The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit, who is the processed Triune God. According to the type in Exodus 30:23-25, the compound Spirit includes the processed Triune God and all that He does and is, having the elements of the divine nature, human nature, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.<p>First John 2:27 says, &#8220;The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things....&#8221; The teaching by the anointing is not objective; rather, it is very subjective. It is not an outward teaching by words but an inward teaching through our inner spiritual consciousness. This teaching by anointing adds the divine elements of the Divine Trinity, which are the elements of the anointing compound Spirit, into our inner being to be our elements. This kind of anointing is going on in us all the time. It is like the repeated painting of some article: The paint not only indicates the color, but also by coat upon coat being added, the elements of the paint are added to the thing painted. It is in this way that the Triune God is transfused, infused, and added into all the inward parts of our being that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements.<h2 class=head2>45. Sealing Us</h2><p>After 2 Corinthians 1:21 says that God has anointed us, verse 22 goes on to say that God has sealed us. The anointing in verse 21 is the sealing in verse 22. Since God has anointed us with Christ, He has also sealed us in Him. As we are under the anointing, the anointing becomes a sealing to us. The sealing causes us to become different from others and bear God&#8217;s image. First, God through the anointing adds the essence of Himself into us. Then this anointing seals us with the essence of God and causes us to bear the image of God.<p>Ephesians 1:13 says that we &#8220;were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&#8221; Ephesians 4:30 says that in the Holy Spirit we were &#8220;sealed unto the day of redemption.&#8221; To be sealed with the Holy Spirit is to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. We have been designated as God&#8217;s inheritance. At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God. The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God&#8217;s image, signified by the seal, thus making us like God.<p>From the time we were saved, the Holy Spirit as the seal within us began to seal us continually with the element of God that we may be transformed in our disposition until we are fully redeemed in our body. &#8220;Unto the redemption of the acquired possession&#8221; (1:14) gives the purpose of the sealing of the Holy Spirit. The seal of the Holy Spirit is living, and it works within us to permeate and transform us with the divine element until we are mature in God&#8217;s life and eventually fully redeemed, even in our body.<h2 class=head2>46. Pledging in Us</h2><p>God not only has anointed us, sealed us, with the Spirit, but also has given the Spirit as the pledge in us (2 Cor. 1:22). The seal is a mark that we are God&#8217;s inheritance, God&#8217;s possession, and that we belong to God. The pledge is a guarantee that God is our inheritance or heritage belonging to us. The Spirit within us is the pledge, the earnest, of God being our portion in Christ.<p>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Spirit is &#8220;the pledge of our inheritance.&#8221; The Greek word for pledge also means foretaste, guarantee. God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we will inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance. In ancient times the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchasing of land. The seller gave the purchaser some soil as a sample from the land. Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, is also a sample. The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we will inherit of God in full. The Holy Spirit today is a guarantee, a foretaste, and a sample of our divine inheritance, until our body is transfigured in glory, at which time we will inherit God and enjoy Him in full.<p>Second Corinthians 5:5 says, &#8220;He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a pledge.&#8221; The Greek word for wrought also means fashioned, shaped, prepared, made fit. God has wrought us, fashioned us, shaped us, prepared us, made us fit, for the very purpose that our mortal body might be swallowed up by His resurrection life. Thus our entire being will be saturated with Christ. God has given us the Spirit as the pledge, the earnest, the foretaste, the guarantee, of this wonderful and marvelous part of His complete salvation, which He has given to us in Christ.<p>God&#8217;s attaching us to Christ issues in three things: an anointing that imparts God&#8217;s element into us, a sealing that forms the divine element into an impression to express God&#8217;s image, and a pledging as a foretaste that gives us a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God. These three matters-anointing, sealing, and pledging-are actually one. They are one thing with three aspects and are related to the work of the Spirit within us. The more we enjoy the divine fellowship through the Spirit, the more opportunity the Spirit has to dispense Himself into us by anointing us, sealing us, and pledging in us. Therefore, in our fellowship with the Triune God, we experience the Spirit&#8217;s anointing, sealing, and pledging.<h2 class=head2>47. Being the Firstfruits of Our Divine Inheritance</h2><p>The indwelling Spirit is the firstfruits (foretaste) of our divine inheritance, which is the Triune God Himself. Romans 8:23 says, &#8220;We ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit....&#8221; The firstfruits of the Spirit are simply the Spirit Himself as the firstfruits. The Triune God is our enjoyment; He is everything to us. There will be a harvest of this blessing at the redemption of our body; that will be our full enjoyment of God. Today the Spirit is the firstfruits of the coming harvest, the foretaste of our full enjoyment of God.<p>Therefore, the firstfruits refer to a foretaste that is a guarantee that we shall experience the full taste. What we have enjoyed and are still enjoying of God is just a foretaste. The full taste is coming. The Triune God Himself is the full taste, and He has given us His Spirit as the firstfruits of all the riches of God&#8217;s being to be our foretaste. Today we only need to live in the fellowship of the Triune God to enjoy the Spirit as the firstfruits. This enjoyment is the guarantee that at the Lord&#8217;s coming back we will enter into the full enjoyment of God.<h2 class=head2>48. Being the Access for Us to Draw Near to the Triune God</h2><p>The Spirit is also the access for us to draw near to the Triune God. Ephesians 2:18 says, &#8220;Through Him [Christ] we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&#8221; Here the trinity of the Godhead is implied. Through God the Son, who is the Accomplisher, the means, and in God the Spirit, who is the Executor, the application, we have access unto God the Father, who is the Originator, the source of our enjoyment. First, the Father came to us in the Son, and then the Son came into us as the Spirit. Now through the Son we have access in the Spirit unto the Father to draw near to Him and enjoy Him.<p>According to the context of this verse, through the redemption of Christ all the Jewish and the Gentile believers, who were once at enmity, have access to the Father in one Spirit. First, both the Jewish and the Gentile believers were reconciled in one Body to God (v. 16). That was a positional matter. Then they both have access in one Spirit unto the Father. This is experiential. To be reconciled to God is to be saved; to have access unto the Father is to enjoy God, who, as the source of life, regenerated us to be His sons. The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father through the Son. Through this wonderful two-way traffic we enjoy the dispensing of the Triune God.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>The Spirit in us is the means for us to take Christ as our righteousness. Through the Spirit and by faith we have Christ as the righteousness that we live out. The Spirit also witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. He assures us that we have God&#8217;s life and restricts us to walk according to this life, in keeping with our being children of God. The Spirit also cries with our spirit, &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221; When we cry, &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221; He cries with us in our crying, expressing the strong affection we have toward the Father and leading us into the intimate enjoyment of the Father. The Spirit also bears witness in our conscience, testifying that our speaking and walk in Christ are true. The Spirit also anoints us, continually adding the divine elements of the Divine Trinity, which are the elements of the compound Spirit, into us. He also seals us that we may bear God&#8217;s image to be God&#8217;s designated inheritance, and transforms us with the divine elements until we are fully redeemed in our body. He is also pledging in us, guaranteeing that God is our inheritance belonging to us, and affording us a taste beforehand of this inheritance that we may have a sample of what we will inherit of God in full. The Spirit is also the firstfruits of our divine inheritance as the foretaste of our full enjoyment of God and the guarantee that at the Lord&#8217;s coming back we will enter into the full enjoyment of God. The Spirit is the access for us to draw near to the Triune God. Through the redemption of Christ and in one Spirit we have access to the Father to draw near to Him and enjoy Him.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Explain the relationship between Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6.</li><li>Briefly state the significance of the Spirit&#8217;s anointing us, sealing us, and pledging in us.</li><li>Briefly explain the significance of the Spirit&#8217;s being the firstfruits of our divine inheritance.</li><li>According to Ephesians 2:18, how does the Spirit serve as the access for us to draw near to God?</li></ol><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE SPIRIT AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(7)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Working in us, on us, and for us:	<ol class="decimal" start="49">	<li>Partaken of by us.</li>	<li>Being the fellowship of the Triune God to us.</li>	<li>Being the oneness of the Body of Christ.</li>	<li>Freeing us from the letters of the law.</li>	<li>Showing us the way of the Holy of Holies.</li>	<li>Testifying to us concerning the law of life of the new covenant.</li>	<li>As the means for us to serve God.</li>	<li>Resting upon us as the glory when we are reproached.</li>	<li>Justifying the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh.</li>	<li>As the consummation of the Triune God for us to be baptized into the Divine Trinity.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head3>TEXT</h2><p>In this lesson we will continue to see the Spirit&#8217;s work in us, on us, and for us.<h2 class=head2>49. Partaken of by Us</h2><p>Hebrews 6:4 indicates that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit. Since we have received the Holy Spirit through faith (Gal. 3:14), we are partakers of Him. The Holy Spirit is what God in His gospel promised to give us (Gal. 3:14). God called us from the heavens to the heavenly things that we might become partakers of His Holy Spirit and share in His Holy Spirit. It is by His Holy Spirit that we can live a heavenly life on earth and partake of the divine holiness. As partakers of the Holy Spirit, we partake of God as our enjoyment.<p>The Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, is also the reaching to us of the Triune God. Unless it is through the Spirit, the Father and the Son could not reach us. Now the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit-has reached us through the Spirit, and in the fellowship of the Spirit we partake of Him, so we enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches.<h2 class=head2>50. Being the Fellowship of the Triune God to Us</h2><p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; The apostle&#8217;s blessing here is composed of attributes of the Triune God. The love of God is the source, the grace of the Lord is the flow, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the dispensing of the grace of the Lord with the love of God to transmit the Lord with God into our being for our full enjoyment of the Triune God.<p>The grace of Christ is the rich element of Christ, the love of God is the rich element of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the aggregate of the rich elements of Christ and of God transmitted into our being for our enjoyment. Through the Holy Spirit love, grace, and fellowship are transmitted into us for our enjoyment. Therefore, the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is the fellowship of the Triune God to us that we may enjoy the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit simultaneously, which is to enjoy the Triune God in three aspects-love, grace, and fellowship.<h2 class=head2>51. Being the Oneness of the Body of Christ</h2><p>In Ephesians 4, concerning the living and responsibility needed for the church life, Paul said, &#8220;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace&#8221; (v. 3). This shows us that to have the proper Body life, we first need to care for the oneness. This is crucial and vital to the Body of Christ. Strictly speaking, oneness differs from unity. Unity is the state in which many people are united together, whereas oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers, which makes them all one. This oneness is a person, the Spirit Himself, who dwells within us. It is similar to the electricity flowing within many lamps, making them all one in the shining. In themselves, the lamps are separate, but in the electricity they are one. To keep the oneness of the Spirit is to keep the life-giving Spirit. If we act apart from the Spirit, we are divisive and lose the oneness. If we stay in the life-giving Spirit, we keep the oneness of the Spirit, and we also keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.<p>Ephesians 4:4 goes on to say, &#8220;One Body and one Spirit.&#8221; The Spirit is the essence of the one Body, and He is also the life of the Body. Apart from the Spirit, the Body could not exist as a living organism. Without the Spirit, the Body would be empty and have no life. Furthermore, the Spirit is for the Body and in the Body. Therefore, the Body and the Spirit are not two separate entities; they are one. As we remain in the divine fellowship through the Spirit, we are kept by the Spirit in the unique oneness of the Body, a oneness that is the indwelling Spirit Himself.<h2 class=head2>52. Freeing Us from the Letters of the Law</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&#8221; This verse shows us that after finishing all the processes, the Lord became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection. The Spirit not only gives us the divine life but also frees us from the bondage of the law.<p>At Paul&#8217;s time the Old Testament law was a great bondage to the Jews. They were under the bondage of circumcision, the bondage of dietary regulations, and the bondage of the Sabbath. Today, however, since Christ has come, it is no longer the Old Testament age of the law in letters, but the New Testament age of the pneumatic Christ. Moses, with the letter of the law, put the people under bondage, but the Spirit frees us from religious regulations, rituals, and traditional doctrines. We must turn our heart to the Lord, who is the Spirit, and set our mind on the mingled spirit; then the Spirit will free us that we may enjoy the full freedom in grace.<h2 class=head2>53. Showing Us the Way of the Holy of Holies</h2><p>Hebrews 9:8 says, &#8220;The Holy Spirit thus making this clear, that the way of the Holy of Holies has not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing.&#8221; By the Holy Spirit&#8217;s making clear, we know that the way of the Holy of Holies had not yet been manifested in the Old Testament. When Christ was crucified, the way to the Holy of Holies was freshly cut for us. Here, the first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signifies the old covenant, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies the new covenant. The veil that closed off the Holy of Holies was split in two (Matt. 27:51) by the death of Christ, which crucified the flesh (Heb. 10:20; Gal. 5:24), and now the way of Holy of Holies has been manifested. Hence, we do not need to remain in the Holy Place, that is, the old covenant, the soul; we must enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, the new covenant, the spirit. Now that the Spirit within us is making clear to us the way to enter the inner chamber of God&#8217;s dwelling place, we should not remain either in the outer court or in the Holy Place. We should enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, our spirit, to draw near to God and enjoy Him as love, light, and every divine thing.<h2 class=head2>54. Testifying to Us concerning the Law of Life of the New Covenant</h2><p>Hebrews 10:15-17 says, &#8220;The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after having said, &#8216;This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them,&#8217; He then says, &#8216;And their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall by no means remember anymore.&#8217;&#8221; In this chapter the writer of Hebrews was seeking to prove to the believers that there was no longer any need to offer the sacrifice for sin, because Christ has accomplished the putting away of sins. The problem of sin has been solved. Now in these verses the writer emphasizes this fact by further pointing out the inward law of life, that the Holy Spirit also testifies to this effect. The Holy Spirit quotes the word in Jeremiah 31:33-34, saying that God would put His laws upon the hearts of His people and that He would not remember their sins anymore. This proves that the Holy Spirit testifies that our sins have been taken away.<p>According to Hebrews 8, the new covenant which God made with us includes four things: the law of life which is imparted into us, God being our God and we being His people, the inner ability of knowing God, and God&#8217;s forgiveness of our sins. These four things are focused on the law of life. When we are in the Holy of Holies, that is, when we are in our spirit, the Spirit testifies to us that God has imparted His divine life with its law into our spirit. This law will spread into our inward parts, such as our mind, emotion, and will, and will become several laws. This law of life differs from the law of letters. It does not regulate us from without by and according to dead letters; rather, it regulates us from within by and according to its life element. Since we all, great or small, have the law of life, we should not walk according to the knowledge of the law of letters but according to the inward consciousness of the law of life.<h2 class=head2>55. As the Means for Us to Serve God</h2><p>Philippians 3:3 says, &#8220;We are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.&#8221; Here we see that the Spirit is the means for us to serve, to worship, God. The Greek word rendered serve here means to serve as a priest. All New Testament believers are priests to God (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6). Hence, our ministry to the Lord, in whatever aspect, is a priestly service. Furthermore, those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ&#8217;s crucifixion. They are absolutely different from the Judaizers. They serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they do not have confidence in the flesh but in the Spirit.<p>In Philippians 3:2-3 there is a threefold contrast: believers who serve by the Spirit of God, in contrast to the dogs; believers who boast in Christ Jesus, in contrast to evil workers; and believers who have no confidence in the flesh, in contrast to the concision. The Judaizers lived by their fallen nature, whereas the believers in Christ serve by the Spirit of God. The fact that the Judaizers had confidence in their circumcision was a sign that their confidence was in their flesh, that is, what they were and had in their natural being and their natural qualities and qualifications. But we who believe in Christ serve by the Spirit, boast in Christ, and do not have confidence in the flesh.<h2 class=head2>56. Resting upon Us as the Glory When We Are Reproached</h2><p>First Peter 4:14 says, &#8220;If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.&#8221; To be in the name of Christ is actually to be in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself. The believers, having believed into Christ (John 3:15) and having been baptized into His name (Acts 19:5), that is, into Himself (Gal. 3:27), are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and are one with Him (6:17). When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing in His sufferings, in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10).<p>When we are reproached and suffer persecution in the name of Christ, the Spirit of glory rests upon us and remains with us. The Spirit of glory is the One through whom Christ was glorified in His resurrection (Rom. 1:4). This very Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God Himself, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution, for the glorifying of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory. The more we suffer and are persecuted, the more the glory of God rests upon us. This is truly a blessing. Therefore, we should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because we are participating in the sufferings of Christ, and the Spirit of glory is resting upon us.<h2 class=head2>57. Justifying the Church as the Manifestation of God in the Flesh</h2><p>First Timothy 3:16 says, &#8220;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness:/He who was manifested in the flesh,/Justified in the Spirit.&#8221; In this verse He refers to Christ, who was God manifested in the flesh. The transition from the mystery of godliness to He implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness (Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20). This mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living also is the manifestation of God in the flesh.<p>When Christ was on earth, He was God manifested in the flesh. The incarnated Christ in His human living was not only vindicated as the Son of God by the Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; Rom. 1:3-4) but also justified, proved, and approved as right and righteous by the Spirit (Matt. 3:15-16; 4:1). He was manifested in the flesh but was vindicated and justified in the Spirit. He appeared in the flesh, but He lived in the Spirit (Luke 4:1, 14; Matt. 12:28) and offered Himself to God through the Spirit (Heb. 9:14). His transfiguration (Matt. 17:2) and His resurrection are both justifications in the Spirit. Furthermore, in resurrection He even became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17) to dwell and live in us (Rom. 8:9-10) for the manifestation of God in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. Hence, now we know Him and His members no longer according to the flesh but according to the Spirit (2 Cor. 5:16). Since the manifestation of God in the flesh is justified in the Spirit, and the Spirit is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16), we must live and behave in our spirit that this justification may be accomplished. In this way, the Spirit will also justify the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh.<h2 class=head2>58. As the Consummation of the Triune God for Us to Be Baptized into the Divine Trinity</h2><p>Matthew 28:19 says, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; After Christ completed His ministry on earth, went through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged the disciples to baptize those who were to become His disciples into the name of the Triune God.<p>The name is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is, and this is also to immerse him into the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. When we believe into the Lord Jesus, we are baptized into the Triune God in the Spirit. Now, as baptized ones, we are in an organic union with the Triune God. Therefore, whatever the Father is, whatever the Son has, and whatever the Spirit receives become our portion for our experience and enjoyment.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>When the Spirit works in us, we become partakers of Him that through Him we can live a heavenly life on earth, share in God&#8217;s holiness, and enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches. The Spirit is also the fellowship of the Triune God to us, transmitting the Lord with God into us for our full enjoyment of the Triune God. The Spirit is also the oneness of the Body of Christ. If we act apart from the Spirit, we lose the oneness; if we remain in the life-giving Spirit, we keep the oneness of the Spirit and we also keep the oneness of the Body of Christ. The Spirit frees us from the letters of the law that we may not be under the bondage of religious regulations, rituals, and traditional doctrines but enjoy full freedom in grace. He also shows us that the veil that closed off the Holy of Holies was split in two by the death of Christ and that the way of the Holy of Holies has been manifested. Hence, we must enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, we must enter into our spirit, to draw near to God and enjoy Him as love, light, and every divine thing. He also testifies to us that the law of life of the new covenant has been imparted into our spirit, so that we should not walk according to the knowledge of the law of letters but according to the inward consciousness of the law of life. He is also the means for us to serve God, that we should not boast in the law but boast in Christ, and not have confidence in the flesh but have confidence only in the Spirit. He rests upon us as the glory when we are reproached, for the glorifying of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory. He justifies the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the issue of Christ&#8217;s having become the Spirit to dwell and live in us that God may be manifested in the flesh in the proper church life. He is also the consummation of the Triune God that we may be baptized into the Divine Trinity, that is, into all that the Triune God is, into the all-inclusive Spirit, that we may have an organic union with the Triune God to enjoy whatever the Father is, whatever the Son has, and whatever the Spirit receives.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state how the Spirit is the fellowship of the Triune God to us.</li><li>Briefly explain the significance of the Spirit as the oneness of the Body of Christ in us.</li><li>What is the difference between the law of life and the law of letters?</li><li>Briefly explain why we are still able to rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ.</li><li>Briefly give the significance of the Spirit&#8217;s justifying the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh.</li></ol><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE SPIRIT AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(8)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Working in us, on us, and for us:	<ol class="decimal" start="59">	<li>Coming upon us as the power.</li>	<li>Filling us outwardly.</li>	<li>Being the element for us to be the sufficient ministers of the new covenant.</li>	<li>Being the element of the ministry of the New Testament.</li>	<li>Giving us the utterance to speak in different tongues.</li>	<li>Witnessing of the resurrected and exalted Christ.</li>	<li>As the power for us to preach the gospel of Christ to the Gentiles.</li>	<li>Demonstrating Himself with power in our preaching.</li>	<li>As the means for us to speak for Christ.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head3>TEXT</h2><p>In this lesson we will continue to see the different aspects of the Spirit&#8217;s work.<h2 class=head2>59. Coming upon Us as the Power</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to go and disciple the nations, bringing them into the Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit came upon the disciples to enable them to carry out the Lord&#8217;s commission. The great commission of bringing others into the Triune God requires not only life but also power. With the Spirit as their life and power, the believers may command the nations to believe in the Lord Jesus so that they may be brought into the organic union with the Triune God.<p>In Acts 1:8 the Lord says, &#8220;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&#8221; Here, to receive power is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit (v. 5) for the fulfillment of the promise of the Father (v. 4; Luke 24:49). Having the Holy Spirit upon us is different from having the Holy Spirit in us (John 14:17). The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection (John 20:22) to be the Spirit of life essentially. The same Spirit came upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost to be the Spirit of power economically. As for the Spirit of life, we need to breathe Him in as breath. As for the Spirit of power, we need to put Him on as a uniform.<p>The function of the Spirit as power is not for the life which we receive from the Lord inwardly; it is for the work which we do for the Lord outwardly. God gives us the Holy Spirit as power for our outward work that He may be our power, authority, ability, and capacity outwardly and be employed by us.<h2 class=head2>60. Filling Us Outwardly</h2><p>After the Spirit descended upon the believers, He filled them outwardly. Acts 2:4 says, &#8220;They were all filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The Greek word for filled in this verse is pletho (also used in 4:8, 31; 9:17; 13:9; Luke 1:15, 41, 67), denoting an outward filling. According to its usage in Acts, pleroo denotes the filling of a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in 2:2, and pletho denotes the filling of persons outwardly, as the Spirit filled the disciples outwardly in 2:4. The disciples were filled (pleroo) inwardly and essentially with the Spirit (13:52) for their Christian living, and were filled (pletho) outwardly and economically with the Spirit for their Christian ministry. The inward filling Spirit, the essential Spirit, is in the believers (John 14:17; Rom. 8:11), whereas the outward filling Spirit, the economical Spirit, is upon them (Acts 1:8; 2:17). Every believer in Christ should experience both aspects of the Holy Spirit.<p>The outward filling of the poured-out Spirit was the ascended Head&#8217;s baptizing of His Body into the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost the Jewish believers, the first part of His Body, were baptized; in the house of Cornelius the Gentile believers, the second part of His Body, were baptized in the same way (10:44-47). By these two steps He baptized once for all His entire Body into the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13).<p>The fact of the baptism in the Spirit was accomplished on the Body of Christ once for all, whereas the experiences of the baptism in the Spirit are shared by individual believers numerously at different times and in different places. In fact, we, the saved ones, all were baptized in the Spirit on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. However, in experience, we receive the baptism in the Spirit at different times and in different places-each at his own time and in his own place. For example, Peter and the one hundred twenty disciples in the early days were filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly on the day of Pentecost. They did not have just that one experience, but later still continued to have experiences of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit (Acts 4:8, 31). Another example was Paul. After Paul&#8217;s conversion on the road to Damascus, it was not until three days later that Ananias was sent by the Lord to lay hands on him that he might be filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly. Later, he again experienced the outward filling of the Holy Spirit (13:9). We all need to see this glorious fact and remove all causes and hindrances that prevent us from experiencing this fact. If so, we can claim it by faith and experience it that the Holy Spirit may fill us outwardly.<h2 class=head2>61. Being the Element for Us to Be the Sufficient Ministers of the New Covenant</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 3:6 the apostle Paul said, &#8220;Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&#8221; Letter here means the written code of the law. The Spirit is the Spirit of the living God, with whom the apostles ministered Christ into the believers. The apostolic ministry for the New Testament is not of dead letters, like the Mosaic ministry for the Old Testament, but of the living Spirit, who gives life. The letter of the law only requires of man but is unable to supply man with life (Gal. 3:21). Because of man&#8217;s inability to fulfill the requirements of the law, the law kills man (Rom. 7:9-11). The Spirit, the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, imparts the divine life, even God Himself, into the believers and the apostles, making them ministers of a new covenant, the covenant of life. Hence, their ministry is one constituted with the Triune God of life by His life-giving Spirit.<p>Therefore, the apostles became ministers of the new covenant not by human knowledge or natural effort but by the Spirit as the constituting element. There was a real spiritual constitution within them, and this constitution was of the Spirit. As a result, they became servants of the new covenant to minister this covenant. The Spirit who works in us today is the Spirit of the new covenant ministry that gives life. Within this Spirit there are many divine elements, which not only transform us but also constitute us the new covenant ministers. As the divine element is being dispensed into us by the Spirit, He works in us to transform us and becomes the element that makes us sufficient ministers of the new covenant.<h2 class=head2>62. Being the Element of the Ministry of the New Testament</h2><p>Not only is the Spirit the element for the apostles to be the sufficient ministers of the new covenant, but the Spirit is the element of the ministry of the New Testament itself. Second Corinthians 3:8 says, &#8220;How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be more in glory?&#8221; The ministry of the Spirit is the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life. The ministry of the new covenant is not merely a matter of our work or preaching or teaching. It is a matter of spiritual constitution, a constitution of the Spirit with the divine life and the divine truths. Such a constitution makes us sufficient, competent, as ministers of the new covenant. Hence, we need to experience the divine life and know the divine truths by the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God.<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:7 and 8 Paul presents a strong contrast between the ministry of death and the ministry of the Spirit. The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of death; the New Testament ministry is a ministry of life embodied in the Spirit. The essence of the Spirit dispensed into us is life. Without the Spirit there is no source of life; neither is there the element or sphere of life. The Spirit, who is of life, is the element of the New Testament ministry. In every aspect and in every way the New Testament ministry dispenses Christ into us as the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head2>63. Giving Us the Utterance to Speak in Different Tongues</h2><p>On the day of Pentecost the Spirit gave the believers the utterance to speak in different tongues. Acts 2:3 and 4 say, &#8220;There appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were distributed; and it sat on each one of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth.&#8221; The tongues of fire here are a symbol of speaking, symbolizing that God&#8217;s economical Spirit of power is mostly for speaking. He is the speaking Spirit. The different tongues mentioned here were the dialects of the attendants (vv. 6, 8). The disciples were Galileans (v. 7), yet, by the utterance given of the Holy Spirit, they spoke the different foreign dialects of the attendants who came from different parts of the world. However, this does not mean that those who were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit all spoke in different dialects (cf. note 1 of 2:4 and note 1 of 10:46). In any case, one manifestation of the believers&#8217; being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit was that they were given the utterance by the Spirit to speak in different tongues; with these tongues they uttered the things concerning Christ in His resurrection and ascension.<h2 class=head2>64. Witnessing of the Resurrected and Exalted Christ</h2><p>The Spirit in us also witnesses of the resurrected and exalted Christ. Acts 5:32 says, &#8220;We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit.&#8221; As the context of this verse indicates, these things refers to the resurrection and exaltation of Christ. Verse 30 says, &#8220;The God of our fathers has raised Jesus, whom you slew by hanging Him on a tree.&#8221; Verse 31 continues, &#8220;This One God has exalted to His right hand.&#8221; Both the apostles and the Holy Spirit were witnesses of these things, because the Spirit, as the Witness of the resurrected and exalted Christ, gave utterance to the believers and enabled them to witness of the Christ who is in His resurrection and exaltation. Today we, through the all-inclusive Spirit, need to testify of and preach the Christ who is in His resurrection and exaltation.<h2 class=head2>65. As the Power for Us to Preach the Gospel of Christ to the Gentiles</h2><p>The Spirit is the power for us to preach the gospel of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul said, &#8220;I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not accomplished through me for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and by work, in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ&#8221; (Rom. 15:18-19). During Paul&#8217;s time, Illyricum was a remote region in the northeastern corner of Europe, yet Paul was able to preach the gospel from Jerusalem to a remote, uncultured region. This is because he preached the gospel to the Gentiles in a prevailing way through the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit as power. As a result of such gospel preaching, the unclean, defiled Gentiles were sanctified in the Holy Spirit and became an acceptable offering to God (v. 16). In the same way, today we need to preach the gospel of Christ to the Gentiles through the Spirit as power, that Gentiles in increasing numbers may turn from paganism and all other isms unto the obedience of the faith.<h2 class=head2>66. Demonstrating Himself with Power in Our Preaching</h2><p>When we preach the word of the Lord, the Spirit demonstrates Himself with power in our preaching. In 1 Corinthians 2:4 Paul said, &#8220;My speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.&#8221; Persuasive words of wisdom issue from the human mind; demonstration of the Spirit comes from our spirit. This shows us that Paul&#8217;s speech and proclamation were not from his mind with words of speculation but from his spirit with the release and exhibition of the Spirit and, hence, of power.<p>First Thessalonians 1:5 says, &#8220;Our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here we see that the gospel preached by the apostles was preached not only in word but also in power and in the Holy Spirit. Power and the Holy Spirit always go together in the preaching of the gospel. Therefore, when we preach the word of God, if we are willing to put aside our human wisdom, not depending on our eloquence but exercising our spirit and trusting solely in the work of the Spirit, the Spirit will demonstrate Himself with power in our preaching that people may be subdued.<h2 class=head2>67. As the Means for Us to Speak for Christ</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 we see that the Spirit is the means for us to speak for Christ. &#8220;I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit&#8221; (v. 3). Paul&#8217;s thought was that the dumb, voiceless idols in verse 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless. But the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit. This kind of speaking is related to the spiritual gifts. No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, &#8220;Jesus is accursed&#8221;; he would like to say, and he is able to say, &#8220;Jesus is Lord!&#8221; Paul&#8217;s intention in this portion of the Word was to impress us with the importance of speaking in the Spirit. We cannot speak for Christ unless we are in the Spirit. The Spirit is the element, the sphere, and the means for us to speak for Christ. When we speak Christ in the Spirit, the Spirit will work in our speaking for the dispensing of the Triune God into ourselves and into those who are listening.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>The Spirit is with us in two aspects: He is in us as the Spirit of life essentially, and He is upon us as the Spirit of power economically. The Spirit&#8217;s coming upon us as power is for us to have Him as the power, authority, ability, and capacity of our work for the Lord on earth. The Spirit&#8217;s coming upon us is His filling us outwardly. This is the ascended Head&#8217;s baptizing of His Body into the Spirit. The fact of the baptism in the Holy Spirit was accomplished in two steps, on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, on the Body of Christ once for all; the experiences of the baptism in the Spirit are shared by individual believers numerously, at different times and in different places. The Spirit in us is the element that makes us sufficient ministers of the new covenant. As the divine element is being dispensed into us by the Spirit, He works in us to transform us and constitute us the new covenant ministers. The Spirit is also the element of the New Testament ministry. The ministry of the new covenant is not merely a matter of our work or preaching or teaching. It is a matter of spiritual constitution, a constitution of the Spirit with the divine life and the divine truths. The Spirit also gives us utterance to speak in different tongues, with which we speak the things concerning Christ in His resurrection and ascension. This is a manifestation of our being filled outwardly with the Spirit. The Spirit in us also witnesses of the resurrected and exalted Christ that we may witness outwardly for Christ. The Spirit is also the power for us to preach the gospel of Christ to the Gentiles that the unclean Gentiles may be sanctified in the Holy Spirit and become acceptable offerings to God. As we preach the word of the Lord, the Spirit demonstrates Himself with power in our preaching that people may be subdued. He is also the element, the sphere, and the means for us to speak for Christ. If we speak Christ in the Spirit, the Spirit will work in our speaking for the dispensing of the Triune God into ourselves and into those who are listening.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain the function of the Holy Spirit as the power upon us.</li><li>Briefly state the difference between the fact of the baptism in the Spirit and the experience of the baptism in the Spirit.</li><li>Briefly explain the Spirit being the element for us to be the sufficient ministers of the new covenant.</li><li>How do we experience the Spirit&#8217;s demonstrating Himself with power in our preaching?</li><li>Briefly explain the Spirit being the means for us to speak for Christ.</li></ol><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE SPIRIT AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1><h1 class="title">(9)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>Working in us, on us, and for us:	<ol class="decimal" start="68">	<li>Giving us direction.</li>	<li>As the means for us to predict something.</li>	<li>Telling us the things to come.</li>	<li>Sending us out to spread the gospel.</li>	<li>Working together with the apostles and elders to resolve the problem of keeping the law.</li>	<li>Guiding us by forbidding us and not allowing us.</li>	<li>Establishing the elders in the churches.</li>	<li>Distributing gifts to the members of the Body of Christ.</li>	<li>Manifesting Himself in each one of the members of the Body of Christ through different gifts.</li>	<li>Operating the gifts in each one of the members of the Body of Christ.</li>	<li>Warning us.</li>	<li>Speaking to the churches.</h1>	<li>Speaking with the churches.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head3>TEXT</h2><p>In this lesson we will see the final items of the Spirit&#8217;s work in us, on us, and for us.<h2 class=head2>68. Giving Us Direction</h2><p>The book of Acts shows us that the Spirit gives direction to the believers in many ways. First, this is seen in Philip&#8217;s preaching of the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch. In 8:29-38 the record tells us that &#8220;the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.&#8221; So Philip ran up, went up into the chariot, and sat with the eunuch. Then Philip, beginning from the Scripture which the eunuch was reading, preached Jesus as the gospel to him, and he believed and was baptized. &#8220;And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away&#8221; (v. 39). This indicates that the Lord&#8217;s move in spreading His kingdom through the preaching of the gospel was by the Spirit&#8217;s leading and direction, not by man&#8217;s device and schedule.<p>Following this, in Peter&#8217;s preaching of the gospel to Cornelius, we can also see the Spirit&#8217;s directing. While Peter was in Joppa, praying on the housetop of the house of Simon, a tanner, a trance came upon him and he saw a vision. &#8220;And while Peter was pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, there are three men seeking you. But rise up, go down and go with them, doubting nothing, because I have sent them&#8221; (10:19-20). So Peter went with them to the house of Cornelius as directed by the Spirit and preached the gospel to the Gentiles. In such a case of great significance, it was the Spirit who directed Peter, and not only so, even the sending of the three men to Peter by Cornelius before his conversion was the Spirit&#8217;s move and act through him.<p>In the important step taken by the Lord for the spread of the gospel of His kingdom to the Gentile world, we see that it was also altogether under the Spirit&#8217;s direction. Acts 13:1-3 says, &#8220;Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers....And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.&#8221; Paul and Barnabas were set apart to carry out the Lord&#8217;s great commission to spread His kingdom for the establishment of His church in the Gentile world through the preaching of the gospel. This major step had nothing to do with the church in Jerusalem organizationally. It was absolutely a move by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit through the coordination of the faithful and seeking members of the Body of Christ on earth with the Head in the heavens.<p>Furthermore, in the case of the disciples entreating Paul not to go up to Jerusalem, we can also see the Spirit&#8217;s direction. Acts 21:4 says, &#8220;And when we had sought out the disciples, we remained there seven days. These told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.&#8221; In 20:23 the Spirit indicated to Paul that bonds and afflictions were awaiting him in Jerusalem. Here the Spirit further directed Paul, through some members of the Body of Christ, not to go to Jerusalem.<p>All these cases show that the believers lived, moved, and worked by the direction of the Spirit. Outwardly they were filled with the Spirit of power economically for them to carry out the work of God&#8217;s New Testament economy, and inwardly they were filled with the Spirit of life essentially for them to live a life of the processed Triune God. As a result, they moved, walked, and worked as men of the Spirit. In the same way, today we should experience and enjoy the Spirit to act, walk, work, and serve according to the direction of the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>69. As the Means for Us to Predict Something</h2><p>The Spirit works on the believers inwardly and outwardly as the means for them to predict something. Acts 11:27-28 says, &#8220;And in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. And one of them named Agabus rose up and signified through the Spirit that there was about to be a great famine over the whole inhabited earth.&#8221; Prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God through God&#8217;s revelation; sometimes they are also inspired to predict something, just as what was referred to in this portion of the Word. The prophets predict by the Spirit of God as the means, uttering something from God. Therefore, sometimes the Spirit also works in us, the believers, to enable us to predict something by Him.<h2 class=head2>70. Telling Us the Things to Come</h2><p>In Paul&#8217;s last time to Jerusalem we can see that the Spirit also tells the believers the things to come. In Acts 20:22-23 Paul said, &#8220;And now, behold, I am going bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will meet me there, except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in city after city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.&#8221; Paul did not know what he would meet with in Jerusalem, but he knew one thing-that the Holy Spirit solemnly testified to him that bonds and afflictions awaited him. Later, the prophet Agabus &#8220;took Paul&#8217;s belt; and having bound his own feet and hands, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, In this way will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man whose belt this is and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles&#8221; (21:10-11). This was the Holy Spirit warning Paul, indirectly through a member of the Body, what would befall him in Jerusalem.<p>In 1 Timothy 4, prophesying concerning the degradation of the church, Paul said, &#8220;The Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons&#8221; (v. 1). Here the Spirit told the believers beforehand of the coming apostasy and warned them concerning it.<p>The portions of the Word mentioned above show us that the Spirit tells us, either directly or indirectly, the things to come. Therefore, we need to exercise our spirit that it may become keen and clear to listen to the Spirit&#8217;s speaking, and we also need to learn to receive what the Spirit speaks to us through the members of the Body.<h2 class=head2>71. Sending Us Out to Spread the Gospel</h2><p>In Acts 13 five prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch gave the Head of the Body an opportunity through their ministering and fasting, that the Head, as the Spirit, might set apart Barnabas and Saul and send them out to preach the gospel of Christ (vv. 1-4). On the one hand, the Bible says that Barnabas and Saul were sent by the other three brothers; on the other hand, it says that they were sent out by the Spirit. This proves that the three brothers were one with the Spirit in the Lord&#8217;s move, and the Spirit honored their sending as His. Today, in like manner, the Spirit works in us and on us to gain us that He may send us out to preach the gospel of Christ to others.<h2 class=head2>72. Working Together with the Apostles and Elders to Resolve the Problem of Keeping the Law</h2><p>In Acts 15 we see that the keeping of the Mosaic customs and the ceremony of circumcision had caused not a small disturbance in the church at that time. Hence, the apostles and elders gathered together in Jerusalem to discuss this matter. That was a unique conference held by the apostles of the universal church and the elders of the local church in Jerusalem. Both were the leading ones in the Lord&#8217;s New Testament move on earth. The conference had no chairman; the presiding One was the Holy Spirit (v. 28), the Spirit of Christ, who is the pneumatic Christ, the Head of the church (Col. 1:18) and the Lord of all (Acts 10:36). The decision made in the conference was not based on men&#8217;s voting; it was the result of mutual fellowship under the presiding of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, later in the letter to the churches, they wrote, &#8220;It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things&#8221; (15:28). By this, we can see that there was no voting, and there was neither autocracy nor democracy. Instead, it was altogether a fellowship by, with, and in the Spirit, and it was by the Spirit working together with the apostles and elders that the problem of the keeping of the law was solved.<h2 class=head2>73. Guiding Us by Forbidding Us and Not Allowing Us</h2><p>The Spirit works in us to guide us sometimes also by forbidding us and not allowing us. Acts 16:6 says, &#8220;They passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.&#8221; The move of the apostle Paul and his co-workers for the spread of the gospel was not according to their decision and preference, nor according to any schedule made by human council, but by the Holy Spirit according to God&#8217;s counsel, as that which was indicated in the mission of Philip (8:29, 39). They intended to speak the word in Asia, but the Holy Spirit forbade them. Forbidding is also a part of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s leading.<p>Acts 16:7 continues, &#8220;When they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.&#8221; The Holy Spirit&#8217;s forbidding them from turning to the left to go to Asia and the Spirit of Jesus&#8217; not allowing them to turn to the right to go into Bithynia indicated that Paul and his co-workers should go directly forward, in a direction toward Macedonia and Achaia in eastern Europe. Paul, however, did not have the thought of going there. This made it necessary for the Lord to give him a vision during the night, and in the vision a Macedonian call came to Paul (v. 9).<p>In Acts 16:6-7 the interchangeable use of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. By forbidding and not allowing, the Spirit led the apostles, enabling them to carry out the propagation of the resurrected and ascended Christ. Today our work for the Lord depends on our being guided by the Spirit that we may spread the Lord&#8217;s kingdom by the Holy Spirit according to God&#8217;s will.<h2 class=head2>74. Establishing the Elders in the Churches</h2><p>In Acts 20:28 Paul told the elders of the church in Ephesus to &#8220;take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood.&#8221; It was the apostles who had appointed the elders in every church (14:23). But here Paul, the leading one, who did the appointing, said that it was the Holy Spirit who did the placing of the elders. This indicates that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles in their appointing the elders and that the apostles had done this according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, those who establish the elders in the churches must do so by following the leading and establishing of the indwelling Spirit in them. In this way the arrangement of the eldership will be perfected in the church according to the leading and direction of the Holy Spirit.<p>This word shows us that the existence of the churches is altogether due to the Holy Spirit, not due to the apostles. Although the apostles had appointed the elders, it was the work of the Holy Spirit. This reveals that a church is produced through the work of the Holy Spirit. In other words, the work of the apostles concerning the churches should absolutely be the work that comes out of the Holy Spirit and belongs to the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>75. Distributing Gifts to the Members of the Body of Christ</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:4 says, &#8220;There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit.&#8221; The gifts here refer to the outward gifts, the abilities or capacities for service. Some of them are miraculous, and some are developed out of the initial gifts (which refer to the inward gifts issuing from grace). These gifts, which are obtained through the Spirit, enable the believers to do spiritual things and manifest their spiritual function.<p>Hebrews 2:4 speaks of distributions of the Holy Spirit. Distributions of the Holy Spirit are the things, including the Spirit Himself, which the Holy Spirit distributes to those who receive salvation by faith. This includes also the imparting of the divine life into the believers. All of us who have believed in the Lord Jesus need to realize that the divine life has been distributed into our being with the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. This is the first basic gift distributed by the Spirit. Furthermore, in our experience there are also other gifts distributed by the Holy Spirit. No believer should think that he does not have a spiritual gift. Just as we have human abilities and capacities because we have human life, we also have spiritual gifts because we have the divine life. As long as we have been born of the Spirit and have received the divine life, we possess some spiritual gifts. Moreover, the gifts we have may be different, yet we have obtained them by the same Spirit. Therefore, in the church life we need to develop the spiritual gifts and manifest our spiritual function by the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>76. Manifesting Himself in Each One of the Members of the Body of Christ through Different Gifts</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:7 says, &#8220;To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable.&#8221; All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit in that the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts. Such manifestation of the Spirit is for the profit of the church, the Body of Christ; that is, for the growth in life of the members of the Body of Christ and for the building up of Christ&#8217;s Body.<p>In verses 8 through 10 the apostle lists nine items of the Spirit&#8217;s manifestations as an illustration. Among them, there is the word of wisdom, the word that concerns Christ as the deeper things of God, predestined by God to be our portion (1:24, 30; 2:6-10). There is also the word of knowledge, the word that imparts a general knowledge of things concerning God and the Lord (8:1-7). Furthermore, there is faith, like the faith that can remove mountains, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 13:2 and Mark 11:22-24. There is healing, the miraculous power for healing different diseases. There are works of power, referring to miracles, works of miraculous power other than healing, such as the case of Peter raising Dorcas from death (Acts 9:36-42). There is prophecy, which is to speak for God and to speak forth God, including foretelling and predicting. To speak for God and to speak forth God are gifts out of life, gifts developed by the growth in life; foretelling and predicting are miraculous gifts and have nothing to do with life. There is the discerning of spirits, which is to distinguish the Spirit that is out of God from those spirits that are not out of God (1 Tim. 4:1; 1 John 4:1-3). There are also the various kinds of tongues, referring to proper languages or dialects (Acts 2:4, 6, 8, 11) either of men or of angels (1 Cor. 13:1), not meaningless voices or sounds. Finally, there is the interpretation of tongues, referring to the gift to make the unknown tongues known, understandable (14:13).<p>Although Paul lists nine manifestations of the Spirit, the manifestation of the Spirit by the believers is more than nine items. Of these nine items, speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are listed as the last two, because they are not as profitable as the other items for the building up of the church (vv. 2-6, 18-19). Of these gifts, prophecy as prediction, faith, gifts of healing, works of power, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues are miraculous. The rest-a word of wisdom (like the word of the apostles), a word of knowledge (like the word of the teachers), speaking for God and speaking forth God in prophecy by the prophets, and discerning of spirits-are gifts developed by the growth in life (3:6-7), like those listed in Romans 12:6-8, out of the inward, initial gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:7.<h2 class=head2>77. Operating the Gifts in Each One of the Members of the Body of Christ</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:11 says, &#8220;The one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes.&#8221; The Spirit not only distributes and manifests but also operates. To operate is to move, to manifest the function. The life-giving Spirit works within us to cause us to have the manifestation of gifts and thus make us proper, functioning members in the Body. Moreover, the one Spirit operates all the various aspects of His manifestation, distributing them to many believers individually, the many members of the Body, for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for His expression.<h2 class=head2>78. Warning Us</h2><p>Hebrews 3:7-8 says, &#8220;Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, &#8216;Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness.&#8217;&#8221; Here, the Holy Spirit quoted the word in the Old Testament to warn us not to come short of the promised rest. The children of Israel, as people of God, are a type of us, the New Testament believers. Their entire history is a prefigure of the church. The Holy Spirit used the history of the defeat of the children of Israel to warn us not to repeat their failure so that we lose the Sabbath rest which God has prepared for us, that is, the participation in and enjoyment of Christ as our rest in the church age and in the millennium.<h2 class=head2>79. Speaking to the Churches</h2><p>In the book of Revelation we see that the Spirit speaks to the churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13). Revelation 2:7 says, &#8220;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&#8221; At the beginning of each of the seven epistles in chapters two and three, it is the Lord who speaks (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). But at the end of all seven epistles, it is the Spirit who speaks to the churches (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). This not only indicates that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit, but it also emphasizes that in the darkness of the church&#8217;s degradation the Spirit is vitally important. The One who speaks to us today is not the outward, objective Christ but the inward, subjective Christ. He speaks not only in the letters of the Bible but also in our spirit. Whenever we hear His speaking, Christ is wrought into us.<p>On the one hand, each of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 is the word of the Lord to a particular church; on the other hand, it is a word of the Spirit to all the churches. Hence, every church should give heed not only to the epistle written to her particularly but also to all the epistles written to the other churches. Because the Spirit today is speaking to the churches, we need to be in the churches in order to be rightly positioned to hear the Spirit&#8217;s speaking.<h2 class=head2>80. Speaking with the Churches</h2><p>The Spirit speaks not only to the churches but also with the churches. Revelation 22:17 says, &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say, Come!&#8221; In chapters two and three of Revelation it was the Spirit speaking to the churches; here, at the end of the book, it is the Spirit and the bride, the church, speaking together as one. This indicates that the church&#8217;s experience of the Spirit has improved to the extent that she has become one with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.<p>Here, we have two consummations. One consummation is that the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit- has gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to ultimately become the Spirit. The other consummation is that the tripartite man has gone through the processes of creation, redemption, regeneration, transformation, and glorification to be ultimately constituted into the church as the bride of the Triune God. Eventually, the Spirit and the bride will be joined in marriage in the universal wedding. In the eternity that is without end, by the divine, eternal, and surpassingly glorious life, they will live a life that is the mingling of God and man as one spirit, a life that is superexcellent and that overflows with blessings and joy.<h2 class=head3>SUMMARY</h2><p>In His work in us, on us, and for us the Spirit gives us direction. Whether in our living, in our actions, in our work, or in our preaching of the gospel, the Spirit always gives us definite directions. Sometimes the Spirit also serves as the means for us to predict something that we may be able to foretell future happenings. The Spirit also tells us the things to come, either by speaking to us directly or by speaking to us through the members indirectly. The Spirit also sends us out to preach the gospel to impart the riches of Christ to others. The Spirit also works together with the apostles and elders to resolve the problem of keeping the law and thus put a stop to the disturbance among the churches. By forbidding and not allowing, the Spirit guides us that we may spread God&#8217;s kingdom according to God&#8217;s will. The Spirit also establishes elders in the churches. Although the appointment of elders is carried out through the apostles, it is perfected in the church under the leading and direction of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, the Spirit distributes gifts to the members of the Body of Christ so that every believer can do the spiritual things and manifest the spiritual function. The Spirit also manifests Himself in each one of the members of the Body of Christ through different gifts for the profit of the church, that is, for the growth in life of the members of the Body and for the building up of the Body. The Spirit also operates the gifts in each one of the members of the Body of Christ to cause them to have the manifestation of gifts and thus make them proper, functioning members in the Body. The Spirit also warns us not to repeat the history of the failure of Israel that we may not miss the rest that God has prepared for us. The Spirit also speaks to the churches. He speaks not only in the letters of the Bible but also in our spirit to have Christ wrought into us. Eventually, the Spirit and the bride, the church, speak together as one and are joined in marriage in the universal wedding to live a life that is the mingling of God and man as one spirit, a life that is superexcellent and that overflows with blessings and joy, in the eternity that is without end.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Illustrate how the Holy Spirit gives the believers direction in many ways.</li><li>Illustrate how the Holy Spirit sends the believers out to preach the gospel.</li><li>How are the elders in the churches established?</li><li>What is the meaning of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s distribution of gifts to the members of the Body of Christ?</li><li>How do we experience and have the Holy Spirit&#8217;s speaking to the churches?</li><li>What is the significance of the Spirit&#8217;s speaking with the churches?</li></ol></body></html>
