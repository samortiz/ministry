   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Standing on the Ground of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We think that we are first the members and then become a Body after we are joined together at baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, we start out being the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you like to be a member, you are a member.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you do not like to be a member, you are nevertheless a member.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Anything that is contrary to the Head and the Body does not belong to this life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Riches in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many riches are in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where there is the Body, light spontaneously comes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Body is the place where light is deposited.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Body we have the greatest light.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you only existed as an individual member, it would only be a matter of whether or not you were individually useful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if you are in the Body, whatever function you do not have, others will make up for it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their function will become your function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The hands can touch, and the feet can walk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This causes the members of the Body to build each other up.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Love is in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians 4 speaks of the "building up of itself in love'' v. 16 . Only when one is in the Body does he know what love is.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we have the love in the Body, we can speak the truth one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With some people, you cannot rebuke them apart from the Body.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is difficult for one to love individually.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But in the Body it is easy to love.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, the Bible says that we are all priests, and that the office of the priesthood is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if you say to a nominal member in a denomination, "You are a priest,'' and he takes your word and goes to the pastor the following week during the Holy Communion and says to the pastor, "We are all priests; either of us can conduct the ceremony,'' you will find that there will be immediate trouble.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some speak of guidance but ignore the Body.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is because with the Body we have the right position.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For over twenty years I have not dared to speak concerning money.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But today I dare to speak about money.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is because I am in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If a brother has need today, I can take off my hat and ask you for money.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the same thing happened before and we were standing on a different ground, it would have been unthinkable for me to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today, since we are in the Body, if I do not ask you for money, who do I ask for money?</S>
