[1]  CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: Eph 3:11; 1:9, 11 WHAT ETERNITY IS
[2]  God s will is something that is hidden in God s heart, but His plan is something that is manifested to others.
[3]  CHAPTER TWO THE PRAYER THAT EXPRESSES GOD S WILL Scripture Reading: Matt 6:9-13 WHAT IS PRAYER?
[4]  According to this verse, 1 God will increase Israel with men, 2 God wants men to pray for this matter, 3 men pray for this matter, and 4 God accomplishes it.
[5]  According to this verse, 1 God wants Jerusalem to become a praise in the earth, 2 He has appointed watchmen, 3 the watchmen pray, and 4 God fulfills their desire.
[6]  Following this there are three things that we have to ask for: Your name be sanctified, Your kingdom come, Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.
[7]  Hence, sanctifying God s name is making God s name distinct in the ear of the hearer from all other names who are not God, such as the devil John 8:44 , the stomach Phil 3:19 , and idols Isa 36:19 .
[8]  The Lord wants men to pray for God s kingdom to come to earth, which means for God s rule to come to earth and for God to gain His kingdom on earth.
[9]  God s eternal will is that all things in the heavens and on earth be headed up in Christ v. 10 . In other words, Christ is to be the Head over all things.
[10]  God s will is for Christ to be the centrality of all things and for all things to be subject to Christ so that He may be Head over all things.
[11]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SON OF GOD AND THE CHRIST
[12]  The Bible reveals that the Lord is both the Son of God and the Christ.
[13]  According to John 20:31, a man is saved and receives God s life when he believes in the Son of God.
[14]  God created the angels with a free will, and God also created man with a free will.
[15]  Yet the angels rebelled, man fell, and God s eternal plan was frustrated.
[16]  God s original intention was to express the glory of Christ through all things and particularly through man.
[17]  According to God s ordination, the Lord took on the form of an angel before His incarnation, and He took on the form of a man after incarnation.
[18]  Covereth refers to the covering of the ark, the place where God s righteousness signified by the blood and God s glory signified by God s appearance are found.
[19]  Genesis 1:28 tells us that after God created man, He blessed him and told him to be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over all things.
[20]  On the one hand, God wants to deal with death by life through man s multiplication, and on the other hand, God gave Adam the authority to have dominion.
[21]  This position and authority once belonged to Satan, but now God has replaced him with man.
[22]  Genesis 2:15 says, And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
[23]  The principle of the tree of life is dependence on God, and the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is independence and alienation from God.
[24]  Hebrews 2:5-10 quotes Psalm 8; it is also an exposition of Psalm 8.
[25]  Verse 5 says, For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth.
[26]  God has not given the coming inhabited earth, which is the millennium, to the angels but to man.
[27]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE FALL OF MAN Scripture Reading: Gen 3
[28]  As far as God s eternal will is concerned, His goal is centered on Christ, but as far as His permissive will is concerned, His goal is centered on man.
[29]  God has His eyes on man and He gains man so that He can deal with His enemy through man.
[30]  We have mentioned before that God s eternal plan is for Christ to be glorified and to be made the Head over all things.
[31]  When Satan rebelled and man fell, God had to come in to deal with these two problems before He could accomplish His eternal plan.
[32]  Originally God created man with the purpose of having man deal with the rebellious Satan and to displace his rule.
[33]  In the first temptation the devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God... v. 3 . Satan wanted Him to be the Son of God rather than a man.
[34]  OF SATAN S KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Col 1:13; Acts 26:18; 2 Cor 2:11; Matt 12:25-26
[35]  Satan s tightly organized kingdom and numerous messengers exist for the sole purpose of achieving his evil goal.
[36]  Satan s consistent goal is to be God and to be worshipped as God.
[37]  OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:20-23 THE CHURCH BEING THE CONTINUATION
[38]  The church, as the Body of Christ, is His propagation, continuing His stand and work to fight against God s enemy.
[39]  THE CHURCH CARRYING OUT GOD S WILL ON EARTH Subduing the Rulers and Authorities
[40]  The church has a great responsibility on the earth today.
[41]  On the positive side, the church brings God s will to earth.
[42]  Those who do not open their mouths and do not testify for God have failed to uphold God s will.
[43]  The church s responsibility on the earth today is to perpetuate Christ s victory on the earth and to bring in God s kingdom.
