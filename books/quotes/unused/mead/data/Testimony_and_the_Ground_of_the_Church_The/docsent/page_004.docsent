   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE STEPS IN GOD S EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since God s eternal purpose is to be expressed, all of the work that He has been doing throughout the ages has been for the fulfillment of His purpose; they are the steps in His expression of Himself in men and among men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This line is recorded from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The stories from Adam to the New Jerusalem all show how God manifests Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can only briefly look at this line of God s expression throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. In Adam</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first step of God s expression is seen in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we read the story of Adam, we must remember that his story reveals God s desire to be expressed through him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Making Man in His Own Image</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and in His Likeness</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why did God make man?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did He make Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The record in Genesis 1 clearly reveals that God s intention in making man was for man to be in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God made man in His own image and in His likeness; the man He made was His image and likeness Gen 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the universe the man on earth is in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have previously said that the making of man according to God s image is like a person being photographed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Brother Huang s photograph is taken, the photograph will surely be an image of him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He could print thousands and thousands of copies, distribute them to cities all over the globe, and publish them in many newspapers and magazines; consequently, his image would be seen all over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Similarly, when God made man, He made man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we can say that man was a photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God also wanted man to be fruitful and multiply to fill all the earth; in this way the image of God, His photograph, would fill the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s action clearly implies that He wanted to be expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although Adam had only the image and likeness of God outwardly, in principle he expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although man did not have the life and nature of God, he still expressed God and manifested the story of God in part.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Look at Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was so thoughtful, wise, loving, and capable in his decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All of these characteristics showed forth something concerning God and expressed God in part.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Forming a Spirit in Adam</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In His making of Adam, God did not put His own life and nature into him, but He formed a spirit in Adam so that Adam would be able not only to contact God but also to receive God Gen 2:7; Job 33:4; Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Contacting God may involve merely communicating with God, but receiving God involves God coming into man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only does God want man to contact Him; He also wants man to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible is clear in its revelation concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After God made Adam, He placed Adam in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This clearly indicates that He wanted Adam to eat the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a symbolic picture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Gradually, the Bible shows that the source of life is God Psa 36:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we may also say that life is God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, to eat is to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all have eaten some food and received it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, symbolically, when God put Adam in front of the tree of life, He wanted Adam to eat Him as food, that is, to receive Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If Adam had received God, he would have received God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, he would not only have been like God outwardly, in outward form; he would also have been like God inwardly, in content, in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though Adam did not receive the life of God at that time, this was God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God wanted Adam to receive Him so that he could be like God both outwardly and inwardly in order to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In our reading of the Word, we need to see God s thought.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When God made man, His thought from the very beginning was to express Himself in man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>B. In the Patriarchs</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After Adam, the Bible shows the generations of the patriarchs, including Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in whom the expression of God can also be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not have the time to look at them in much detail, but two matters concerning them are important.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through Their Actions of Faith</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The faith and actions of the patriarchs, or rather, their actions due to their faith, all expressed God Heb 11:4-21; 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They were people who trusted in God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through their faith they were brought into a relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, their actions were affected and changed due to their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The effects and changes in their actions were expressions of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While the people around them walked according to the manner of the world and expressed the world, the walk and living of the patriarchs through their faith in God manifested a different condition and manner.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their condition and manner enabled others to know God more and understand God more, that is, to see God to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their actions of faith can be considered as an expression of God.</S>
