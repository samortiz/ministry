   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Matter of God's Grace</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's goal of bringing forth many sons is accomplished not by man's work but by God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is God's grace?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Contrary to the concept of many, God's grace is not merely unmerited favor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the divine revelation in the New Testament, grace is actually God Himself given to His chosen people for their enjoyment, and this enjoyment will make them God's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This understanding of the grace of God is found in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 1 we see that the Word, who is the very God, became flesh vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1, 14 and that grace came with Him v. 17 . This means that He came as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to John 1, God came as grace to be received by His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verses 12 and 13 say, "As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whoever believes in Him and receives Him will be born of Him to become one of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, by giving Himself to His chosen people as grace, God brings forth many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Two other verses which indicate that grace is God Himself are Galatians 2:20 and 1 Corinthians 15:10.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 he says, "Not I, but the grace of God with me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Taken together, these verses indicate that grace is Christ Himself as the embodiment of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, grace is nothing less than the processed Triune God given to His chosen people to bring forth many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When God called Abraham, He called him with the intention of producing many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because these sons are brought forth by God's grace, God did not ask Abraham to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God desired only that Abraham would agree with Him to believe in what He intended to do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham did believe this, and his believing was considered by God to be righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"He believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness" Gen 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we have the base for the teaching concerning justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul expounded this basic teaching in the New Testament Rom 3:21-31; Gal 3:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's intention is to produce many sons by dispensing Himself into His chosen people as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At least to some extent, this was made known to Abraham, and he accepted it and believed in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, he was counted as righteous in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Genesis 15 God promised Abraham that he would have an heir, and Abraham believed God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, in the very next chapter, because Abraham did not have a child by Sarah, he followed Sarah's suggestion to have a child by Hagar, her handmaid.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hagar gave birth to a son, and he was called Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham's having a child by Hagar was displeasing to God, and He did not appear again to Abraham for thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord appeared to Abraham again, He said to him, "I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly" Gen 17:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord indicated to Abraham that His grace would produce a son by him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But what Abraham had done by himself was of the flesh and as such was condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, Abraham said to God, "O that Ishmael might live before thee!" v. 18 . The Lord then said to Abraham, "Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him" v. 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Genesis 18 the Lord appeared to Abraham again and said to him, "I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son" v. 10a . This indicates that the bringing forth of Isaac would be of the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This may be compared to Mary's bringing forth of Jesus being the coming of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, Sarah did give birth to Isaac Gen 21:1-3 .</S>
