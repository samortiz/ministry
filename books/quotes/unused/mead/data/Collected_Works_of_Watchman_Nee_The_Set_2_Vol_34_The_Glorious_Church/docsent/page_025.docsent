   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR "AND SHE BROUGHT FORTH...A MAN-CHILD"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already seen the woman in Genesis 2 and how she speaks of the man whom God in His eternal will desires to obtain to glorify His name.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then in Ephesians 5 we saw another woman, who is the reality of the woman in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This woman shows how God is working to restore everything to His original purpose after man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now let us look in Revelation 12 at yet another woman.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must consider her in relation to the woman in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation is a book which reveals the things of the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are a total of twenty-two chapters in this book, but by the end of chapter eleven we can say that everything is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation 10:7 says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, then the mystery of God is finished."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter eleven, when the seventh angel sounds his trumpet, everything concerning God's mystery and everything related to God is fully accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 15 says, "And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that when the seventh angel sounds his trumpet, eternity has already begun.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The millennium, the new heaven and new earth, and everything regarding eternity are intimated in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why then are there still eleven additional chapters after the first eleven chapters?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our reply is that the following eleven chapters serve as a supplement to the first eleven chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Beginning with chapter twelve we are told how the kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ and how God will make His Son King forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the seventh angel sounds his trumpet, according to Revelation 11:19, something happens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple; and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The book of Revelation contains many visions, but two central visions serve as the basis for all the others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first is the vision of the throne Rev 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the visions from chapter four to chapter eleven, when the seventh angel sounds the trumpet, are based upon the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second is the vision of the temple Rev 11:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From chapter twelve to the end of the book, all the visions are based upon the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter four, John saw a vision of the throne of God with a rainbow around it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This signifies that from this chapter forward, everything is based upon the authority of the throne and the remembrance of the covenant which God made with every living creature on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The rainbow is the sign of God's covenant which He made with all living things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the present time we cannot see a complete rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At most we see only half of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But there is a rainbow that fully surrounds the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is complete; there is no break in it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is faithful; He will remember and keep His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God will remember His covenant with every living creature on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In everything that God desires to do toward man, He must abide by the covenant He has made.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the end of chapter eleven, John saw another vision a vision of the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Within the temple the ark of the covenant could be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God originally told the Israelites to build the ark according to the pattern which was given on the mount and to put the ark into the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, when Solomon built the temple, the ark was put into it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Israel was taken captive to Babylon, the ark was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But even though the ark on earth was lost, the ark in heaven still remained.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ark on earth was made according to the ark in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The shadow on earth disappeared, but the substance, the reality, in heaven still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the end of Revelation 11, God once again shows us the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is the ark?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The ark is the expression of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It signifies that God must be faithful to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The throne is the place where God exercises authority, and the temple is the place where God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The throne is something outward toward the world and mankind, but the temple is something for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The rainbow around the throne signifies that God will not do anything harmful to man, while the ark in the temple signifies that God will not do anything that comes short of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What God has purposed, He must accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What God desires to do, He is able to successfully perform.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The ark was not only for man, but also for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God cannot deny Himself; He cannot contradict Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God purposed in eternity to have a glorified people, and He determined that the kingdom of this world would become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we see the situation of the church today, we cannot help but ask, "How can God accomplish His purpose?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet we know that God will never stop halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He has the ark, and He Himself has made the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The righteous God cannot be unrighteous with man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, the righteous God can never be unrighteous to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Man never does anything to contradict himself, for each man has his own character.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Neither can God deny Himself in His work because of His own character.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When God unveiled the ark to us, He meant that what He desires to do He must accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Here we must see one point.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is the basis upon which God and His Christ will reign forever and ever?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is the basis upon which God will cause the kingdom of this world to become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His character is the basis.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God will accomplish all of these things because of His own character.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Nothing can hinder Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must learn that whatever is of God can never be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The ark still remains, representing God Himself and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God will accomplish this matter by means of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We thank God that from chapter twelve to the end of the book we are shown how God will accomplish all that He purposed in eternity through His own faithfulness.</S>
