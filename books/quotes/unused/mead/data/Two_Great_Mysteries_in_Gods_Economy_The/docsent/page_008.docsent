   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov 20:27; 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; John 3:6b; 4:24; Rom 8:16; 1:9a; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4; Eph 3:5; 2:22; Rev 1:10; 21:10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is altogether centered on man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is wrapped up with man; so man becomes very crucial in God's mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's mystery is carried out by His economy, and His economy is just to dispense Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man is so crucial to God's mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>MAN AS A VESSEL</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is man?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not ask, "Who is man?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not ask, "Who are you?" but "What are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may say that we are a man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then, what is a man?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible tells us that man is a vessel Rom 9:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A vessel is different from an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man is not an instrument; he is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A vessel is a container to contain something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a container this vessel needs the content, and according to the Bible the content of man is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man is just an empty vessel to contain God as his content.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all must realize that these vessels are living ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are living vessels with a mind, with emotions, and with a will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man today is a living vessel to contain God as the content.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For such a living vessel to receive God as the content there is a recipient, a receiver within man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The radio serves as an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Radio waves in the air can get into a radio and a voice will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is just a little radio, but music and announcements come out of it because something is in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The radio waves in the air need a receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are just like little radios.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to consider ourselves as little radios, vessels to receive the divine waves that bring in the divine music, the divine announcement, and the divine declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once we tune our receiver within, the heavenly music comes in. Man's Body</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is this receiver within man?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have to realize that man as a living vessel is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not consider that we are so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This little vessel created by God is very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Several medical doctors have told me that most medical students spend two years studying the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These doctors all told me the same thing: that after they studied this human body for two years, they had to admit that there is an Almighty One in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of the organization and arrangement of the human body is too marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to believe that this body is created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who designed such a beautiful face?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose the nose were designed with the holes upward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then rain would come in, and we would be troubled with the rain water.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God created two eyebrows as breakwaters to turn the salty sweat away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God also created the hair within our throat upward but all the rest of our hair throughout our whole body downward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the inner hair were downward, we might choke on our phlegm.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these prove that our little, marvelous body as the shell of God's vessel is created by the Almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man's Soul</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What I have been talking about is the physical body, but man is not just the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Within this physical body we have all the things denoted by the term, the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you know how many hearts we have?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must realize that we have two hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One is so bad, and the other is so good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without such a good heart we could not be here.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you ask a medical doctor to check my chest, he may say that I am so strong because I have such a strong heart, a good heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But I would say that my heart is poor, sinful, and ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Actually, we are talking about two hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The doctor is talking about the physical heart, and I am talking about my psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you realize that we have a psychological heart?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The physical heart does not have the ability to love; it only has the ability to pump the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The medical doctors do a lot for the physical heart, but not for the psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we have a mind to think with and to consider with.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have the emotions, the will, and the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In addition to this, according to the Bible we have the soul, the spirit, and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A surgeon could only find the brain.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He could not find the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Where is the emotion?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Where is the will?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Where is the conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many times human beings say that their conscience testifies that they are so good.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But what is the conscience, and where is it?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Man is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have the heart, the mind, the will, the emotion, the conscience, the soul, and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is such a thing within us that is called the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is also called the psyche.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Psuche, the Greek word for soul, is the base word for such words as psychology and psychological.</S>
