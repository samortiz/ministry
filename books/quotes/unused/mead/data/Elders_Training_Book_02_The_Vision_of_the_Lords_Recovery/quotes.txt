[1]  Elders Training, Book 02: The Vision of the Lord s Recovery CONTENTS
[2]  The Vision Concerning God, Concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and Concerning God s Economy
[3]  In the Lord s recovery we have received a particular vision which is absolutely based upon the divine revelation in God s New Testament ministry.
[4]  There is a very strong note on John 1:14 in The Ryrie Study Bible Moody Press, 1978, p.
[5]  1494 that boldly declares that Christ has joined Himself to sinful humanity: Jesus Christ was unique, for He was God from all eternity and yet joined Himself to sinful humanity in the incarnation.
[6]  The God-man possessed all the attributes of deity Phil 2:6 and the attributes common to humanity apart from sin , and He will exist forever as the God-man in His resurrected body Acts 1:11; Rev 5:6 .
[7]  Only the God-man could be an adequate Savior; for He must be human in order to be able to suffer and die, and He must be God to make that death effective as a payment for sin.
[8]  It is crucial for us to see why the Bible does not say that Christ as the Triune God became a man.
[9]  Such a Christ who knew no sin, yet was made sin, was the very embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead of the Triune God when He lived on this earth in His incarnation.
[10]  Such a One was conceived and born of God with the divine essence mingled with the human essence.
[11]  Therefore, such a One was born to be a God-man who is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing two natures and two lives, the divine nature and the divine life, and the human nature and the human life, mingled together as one but without any confusion, without any loss of their distinctive natures, and without anything produced to be a third nature or a third element.
[12]  In addition, Christ died on the cross as a grain of wheat, sown into man s heart.
[13]  As a grain of wheat, He died to release the divine life and to enliven God s redeemed ones, to produce many grains that can be blended together into a loaf to be offered to God.
[14]  Christ died on the cross as at least seven items: as the Lamb of God, as a Man in the flesh, as the last Adam, as a creature, as a serpent in form, as the Peacemaker, and as a grain of wheat.
[15]  Not only did Christ become the life-giving Spirit to impart life to all of His believers, but also in resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God to bring forth many sons of God to be His many brothers Rom 8:29 .
[16]  We have seen that in God s creation, He is the Spirit of God; in God s relationship with man, He is the Spirit of Jehovah; in the initiation of the New Testament economy, He is the Holy Spirit; and in the glorification of Jesus, He is the Spirit.
[17]  The Spirit, after Jesus glorification, became a compound Spirit as indicated by all these titles: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of life.
[18]  We have covered the first four basic visions we have received of the Lord through these past sixty years, our vision concerning God, concerning the Father, concerning the Son, and concerning the Spirit.
[19]  If I can speak concerning all these things without any notes and pass on all these points to you, surely all of you who are younger than I am can get into these matters until you can speak spontaneously of our vision concerning God, the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and God s economy.
[20]  In Colossians 1:15, speaking of Christ as a portion allotted to us by God, Paul tells us firstly that Christ is the image of the invisible God, and also that He is the Firstborn of all creation.
[21]  Since 1958 I have put out some writings to declare that our Christ is surely not only the Creator but also a creature because He is both God, as the Creator, and man, as a creature.
[22]  If you say that Christ is God, surely He is the Creator.
[23]  Chapter one of Colossians first tells us that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation v. 15 and then that through Christ s redemption all the created things in heaven and on earth are reconciled to God v. 20 . Christ s redemption is for all things.
[24]  We need to see the essences, the constituents, of the being of this One who was crucified on the cross and whose name was Jesus Christ.
[25]  In the essential Trinity, the Three are all there without anything that we might call a succession or a progression.
[26]  Because God s salvation is not a simple matter or a matter that can be summarized in a brief way, it is necessary to explain what we mean when we speak of being saved.
[27]  There are a number of stages involved in God s full salvation.
[28]  For example, in chapter one of Philippians Paul said that he was in prison, and he indicated that the prayer of the saints and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ would be salvation unto him v. 19 . This meant that Paul had not been saved yet, but that he would be saved by the saints prayer and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[29]  I would like to ask each of you whether or not you have been saved, and then I would ask whether you have been saved from the unhappy expression on your wife s face, and whether you have been saved from all your worries.
[30]  The believers are those who were fallen sinners and who have been saved by the grace of God Eph 2:8 through their God-given and God-allotted faith 2 Pet 1:1 , which has brought them into an organic union with the Triune God in Christ 1 Cor 6:17 .
[31]  Such an organic union with the Triune God is to be in union with Christ in His death, His resurrection, and His ascension, since the Triune God has passed through Christ s death, resurrection, and ascension.
[32]  Based upon this, they have been regenerated in their spirit by the Spirit of God John 3:6 to be the children of God unto the divine sonship John 1:12-13; Rom 8:16 and to be the members of Christ Eph 5:30 unto His stature Eph 4:13 to be His fullness Eph 1:23 .
[33]  God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God.
[34]  We must also see the inward essence of the church.
[35]  The plant life is the plant kingdom, the animal life is the animal kingdom, the human life is the human kingdom, and the divine life is the divine kingdom.
[36]  In the same principle, John 3:5 tells us that we must be born of the Spirit, which means we are born with the divine life, God s life, the uncreated eternal life.
[37]  Now we should be able to have a clear understanding of John 3:5.
[38]  For years I could not understand why regeneration had something to do with entering into the kingdom of God.
[39]  Then I began to see that regeneration is to receive the divine life and that this divine life is our entrance into the divine life s kingdom.
[40]  In the same principle, if we want to enter into the kingdom of God, we need to be born of the life of God.
[41]  After the Lord s resurrection, the book of Acts tells us that the Lord stayed with the disciples for forty days and in those forty days He taught the disciples concerning the kingdom of God 1:3 .
[42]  In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord s teaching on the mount in chapters five through seven, His parables by the seashore in chapter thirteen, and His prophecy on the Mount of Olives in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five, when added together, unveil to us the entire situation of the kingdom.
[43]  His teaching in Matthew 5 through 7 shows us the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, His parables in Matthew 13 show us the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, and His prophecy in Matthew 24 and 25 shows us the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.
[44]  Also, in this great book, God s economy, His eternal purpose, His eternal plan, is fully revealed with His divine purpose, which is the highest purpose in the universe.
[45]  The Triune God, His economy, Christ s redemption, God s salvation, the believers, the church, and the kingdom all consummate in this one item the New Jerusalem.
[46]  The second reason that we could not say that the New Jerusalem is a physical mansion or a physical city for God s redeemed people to lodge in is that it is altogether not logical to say this.
[47]  The New Jerusalem, the holy city, is a golden mountain Rev 21:16, 18 .
[48]  If this is a real city to lodge in, we must ask how all God s redeemed through all the centuries will be able to lodge there.
[49]  In the Bible, beginning from Adam and Eve Ephesians 5 indicates that Adam and Eve were a type of Christ and the church to the end of the book of Revelation, there are many portions of the Scripture which reveal that God is the universal husband and His redeemed and perfected people are the universal counterpart to match God.
[50]  Then Peter told us in his first Epistle that Christ is the living stone for God s building and we are like Him as the living stones to be built up into a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:4-5 .
[51]  If any one would not accept this vision, how could he answer our questions concerning the New Jerusalem as a sign of the wife as a consummation of all the females in the Bible typifying God s counterpart, and of the tabernacle of God as a consummation of all the tabernacles and temples in the entire Bible?
[52]  We must see that this vision is concerning the ultimate consummation of the entire revelation of God, of the entire Bible, and of the entire Triune God with all His plan, economy, and all His achievements.
[53]  The divine life is the river for God s redeemed to drink of Rev 22:1, 17 , the divine life is the tree for God s redeemed to feed on for their living and for their enjoyment Rev 22:2a, 14, 19 , and the divine life is the light for God s redeemed to live in Rev 21:23, 11 .
[54]  The gospel of John also shows us that the Triune God in this age is our enjoyment in a threefold way.
[55]  If we would present all these rich points in our messages to the saints, I do believe we could use all these points for preaching the gospel.
[56]  We can preach the gospel with all these items to the sinners to show them what the ultimate consummation of God s salvation is.
[57]  We can show them that the ultimate consummation of God s salvation is to enjoy God in His Trinity in such a wonderful, excellent, bountiful, and marvelous way.
[58]  You could also tell them that our God expects not only to be our Creator, our Redeemer, our life, our life supply, our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, but He also expects to be our dwelling place.
[59]  Actually, this New Jerusalem is the processed God expanded into eternity for you and me to live in. Perhaps someone new would ask how God could be our dwelling place.
[60]  We should answer by referring him to Deuteronomy 33:27 which says the eternal God is our dwelling place American Standard Version .
[61]  Psalm 90 which is a psalm of Moses, the man of God, tells us, O Lord, You havet been our dwelling place / In all generations v. 1 . Then you could read Psalm 27:4 which says, One thing I have asked from Jehovah; / That do I seek: / To dwell in the house of Jehovah / All the days of my life, / To behold the beauty of Jehovah, / And to inquire in His temple.
[62]  Even the Old Testament saints considered God as their dwelling place and they desired to dwell in this place to behold God all the time.
[63]  This hymn is comprised of Revelation 21:3-4 which says, And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[64]  The ultimate consummation, the New Jerusalem, is the consummation of the entire divine revelation, the Bible, and of all the wonderful items contained in the Bible as the complete revelation of God.
[65]  We have seen that one of the aspects of the Trinity contained in this ultimate consummation is that the Triune God Himself comprises the basic elements for the building up and the constitution of the New Jerusalem as the gold, pearls, and precious stones.
[66]  Pearl signifies Christ s person in His redemptive death and life-secreting resurrection Rev 21:21 .
[67]  Chapters six through twenty of Revelation are actually a parenthetical section because Revelation is a book on the church.
[68]  You young brothers are in a golden time because you have many years to study these precious things if the Lord delays His coming.
[69]  I believe that all this wonderful knowledge will be very useful in the millennium and in eternity.
[70]  In this ultimate consummation we must also see that the Trinity is the entrance.
[71]  The Son came to redeem v. 4 , the Spirit came to seek and find the lost one and to bring him back to the Father v. 8 , and lastly the Father receives the lost one back to Himself v. 20 . The Son s redeeming, the Spirit s seeking, and the Father s receiving are a complete entrance into the New Jerusalem.
[72]  But if you are equipped and enriched within your being you know that the Spirit denotes the nature of God s person in John 4:24, love denotes the nature of God s essence, and that light denotes the nature of God s expression.
[73]  Revelation 3:12 says, He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
[74]  We have seen already in 21:22 that John told us he saw no temple in the New Jerusalem because its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
[75]  Based upon this kind of understanding, let us read some more verses in the book of Hebrews concerning the New Jerusalem.
[76]  In Hebrews 12:18-21 we see some things in the background: For you have not come forward to a mountain which could be touched and which was set on fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind, and to the sound of a trumpet and to the voice of words, because of which those who heard entreated that no further word should be spoken to them; for they could not bear that which was being commanded: If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.
[77]  INTO HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE IN A FIVE-FOLD WAY
[78]  What we will enjoy together are not physical things, but we will enjoy the Triune God wrought into His chosen people in at least five ways.
[79]  First, the Triune God is wrought into His chosen people as their Creator, their Redeemer, and their Regenerator to give them a threefold triune existence created, redeemed, and regenerated.
[80]  Second, the Triune God has been wrought into His redeemed for their being constituted with the divine nature for the building up of the New Jerusalem with gold, pearls, and precious stones.
[81]  It is a composition of God s redeemed ones who have the Triune God wrought into them in these five ways.
[82]  We must remember that our God in His Trinity, with all His plan, economy, and achievements, has been wrought into this city.
[83]  That means our God in His Trinity with everything He has done and achieved has been wrought into our intrinsic being.
[84]  He will dwell in us as His habitation, the eternal tabernacle, for eternity, and we will dwell in Him as our dwelling, the eternal temple, for eternity.
[85]  I still feel that we need to see more concerning the New Jerusalem and this problem of interpreting it as a heavenly mansion by looking at John 14, an auxiliary chapter to Revelation 21 and 22.
[86]  This meant that the very inner essence of the man Jesus would be released through His death, and when He is released and the Father is released within Him, God is glorified If God has been glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and He will glorify Him immediately 13:32 .
[87]  After the Lord spoke that long discourse in chapters fourteen through sixteen, He prayed a prayer in chapter seventeen.
[88]  The first verse in this chapter is quite crucial: These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.
[89]  In 17:21 the Lord prayed, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me. The issue of Jesus being glorified is that His believers will be brought into the Triune God, into the divine Us.
[90]  Now we must go on to ask what the Lord meant when He said My Father s house in 14:2.
[91]  In order to see what the Father s house is in this verse we must go back to chapter two where the Father s house was already mentioned.
[92]  My Father s house in 14:2 must be interpreted based upon chapter two of the same book where My Father s house is God s temple and where God s temple is the Body of Christ.
[93]  In John 14 the Father s house is a corporate matter, comprising all the believers who are in Christ.
[94]  Then in chapter fifteen is a vine tree, which is again a corporate matter showing us how we are in Christ, the vine tree, and how Christ is in us, the branches.
[95]  In chapter sixteen we see a newborn child v. 21 . This newborn child is Jesus born as the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection Acts 13:33; Hebrews 1:5; Romans 1:4 . This newborn child includes Jesus as the Head and all His members who have been resurrected with Him.
[96]  The house in chapter fourteen, the vine tree in chapter fifteen, the newborn child in chapter sixteen, and the oneness in chapter seventeen are realized by the Triune God wrought into the very being of all the believers as the very source and substance of their existence, as their entrance into this divine realm, as the very essences for their constitution, their building up, as their living, and as their enjoyment.
[97]  I do believe that the Lord has given us a new view of John 14 through 17.
[98]  This is not a matter of doctrinal debate, but a crucial matter concerning the divine life.
[99]  If we interpret the house in John 14 as the heavenly mansion and the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22 as a physical city for the believers to lodge in with God, we kill the New Testament ministry.
[100]  We must realize that our destiny is the same way we live today with the Triune God in a five-fold way: the Triune God wrought into our being as our substance, as our entrance, as our constitution, as our living, and as our enjoyment.
[101]  The only way to interpret My Father s house so that it fits the context and the thought of the Lord s multiplication and glorification is to see that this house is the mystical Body of Christ as His multiplication, His increase, to be God s house today.
[102]  If you are going to understand and get into the depth of chapter fourteen you need such a key the key of interpreting My Father s house as the very mystical Body of Christ to be God s dwelling today which will consummate in His eternal dwelling, the New Jerusalem.
[103]  THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION 6 Editor s Note: Those who were attending the elders training were asked by Brother Lee to come to the Saturday morning meeting of February 11, 1984 thirty minutes earlier for prayer.
[104]  Since we have touched the ultimate consummation, the New Jerusalem, in the book of consummation, Revelation, I feel that it is best to see this ultimate consummation in this book in a more thorough way.
[105]  From seeing the Divine Trinity in an all-embracing way in Revelation 1:4 we must go on to the seven churches.
[106]  The seven churches are a consummation of the doctrine concerning the church.
[107]  This is the consummation of the church, which was first mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16:18 and where the seed of this truth was sown.
[108]  The book of Revelation, especially chapter one, does not continue the thought that the church is God s ekklesia, God s house, Christ s Body, Christ s fullness, the new man, the wife, the Bride of Christ, or the warrior.
[109]  In these epistles to the seven churches we also see Balaam 2:14 and Jezebel 2:20 and their consummation.
[110]  Seemingly, these two are not related to life, to Christ, to the Spirit, or to the church.
[111]  In this chapter we will continue our fellowship on the consummation of all the items in the Bible related to Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church in the book of Revelation.
[112]  Now we must read Revelation 11:19: And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant was seen in His temple.
[113]  This verse, however, says clearly that the temple of God is in heaven.
[114]  This surely is God s dwelling place in heaven.
[115]  The throne with the rainbow in 4:2-3 is the center of all the judgments executed over the earth in chapters six through eleven, on the negative side; whereas the temple with the Ark is the center of all God s accomplishments in the universe carried out in chapters twelve through twenty-two, on the positive side.
[116]  Then from chapter twelve the center of God s government is no longer the throne but the temple with the Testimony, the Ark. Revelation 11:19 is continued by Revelation 15:5 which says, And after these things I saw, and the temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in heaven was opened.
[117]  The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the tabernacle and the temple in the Bible.
[118]  The temple in the heavens surely is not personal, but the New Jerusalem as the temple will be God and the Lamb Himself, which is something personal.
[119]  This copy was a shadow of Christ and the church as God s tabernacle and God s temple in the New Testament on this earth.
[120]  In Revelation 15:2 is the glassy sea, which is a consummation of all the different baptisms in the Old and New Testaments.
[121]  Then in the New Testament is the baptism of John, the baptism of Jesus and His disciples, and the baptism into the Triune God, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into the Body of Christ.
[122]  We must see all these things because we have been covered, veiled, leavened, distracted, held back, misled, delayed, and frustrated.
[123]  If we do not have a clear vision concerning the house in John 14 and especially a clear vision concerning the city in Revelation 21 and 22, I do not believe we could be fully kept in the proper line of life.
[124]  Many Christians still hold a superstitious concept concerning the so-called heavenly mansion; John 14:3 is their basis for believing that the Lord Jesus has gone to the heavens to prepare such a mansion for them.
[125]  According to the King James version of the Bible verses 2 and 3 of John 14 say, In my Father s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.
[126]  If we would read chapters fourteen through seventeen of John by dropping the concept that the Father s house is the heavenly mansion, we would be able to see how much fatness is in these four chapters and what a river of God s pleasures is flowing there with God the Father as the fountain of life and light.
[127]  Some of you have been reading, studying, and reciting Psalm 36:8-9 for years, but you could not and did not interpret these verses in this way.
[128]  The only way we could interpret these verses in this way is by the governing vision the Triune God is working Himself into His chosen and redeemed people to be their life and life supply, to saturate their entire being with the Divine Trinity, that is, with the Father as the fountain, the Son as the fatness, and the Spirit as the river.
[129]  We should thank the Lord that after Psalm 1 is Psalm 2.
[130]  The conclusion of Psalm 2 is that all they that put their trust in Christ are blessed, and that we should kiss the Son, / Lest He be angry v. 12 . Do not meditate in the law but kiss the Son.
