   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FIRST AS THE SON OF DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THEN AS THE SON OF ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we must receive Christ first as the son of David and then as the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To receive Christ as the son of David is to recognize His kingly status and to realize that we should be under His kingship and sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He comes to us not merely as the Savior but as the King-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If He is not the King to us, He cannot be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are not under His authority, His administration, we cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Salvation comes to us under His administration, under His kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we say, "O Lord Jesus, I take You as my King," we will be saved to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have Christ as the son of David, the greater Solomon, we will also have Him as the son of Abraham, the real Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that if we have the kingdom, we will also have the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the blessing of life, the blessing of the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us can testify that by receiving Christ as our King we enjoy the processed Triune God as our blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we are under the Lord's ruling, the more we enjoy the Triune God as our blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 28:19 speaks of the believers' being baptized into the Triune God into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the son of David and as the son of Abraham, Christ brings us into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As long as we have the son of David and the son of Abraham, we have the Triune God, and we are in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the divine blessing in the divine kingdom.</S>
