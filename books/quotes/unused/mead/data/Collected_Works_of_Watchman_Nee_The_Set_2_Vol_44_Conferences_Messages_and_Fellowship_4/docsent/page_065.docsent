   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE GOD'S INHERITANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RICHES OF CHRIST Place: Unrecorded</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20; 3:26 4:1a, 6-7, 28, 31; 5:1; John 15:4a; Rom 6:5-7, 11; Eph 2:4-6; Phil 1:21a; 1 Cor 1:30</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prayer: Lord, under Your light we feel ashamed, because even though we are surrounded by riches, we are living in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although there is living water all around, we are still thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Show us the riches that are found in Christ, and that we are made to partake of these riches through the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not our faith, but Your selection that counts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not of our will, our consecration, or our obedience, but fully Your free provision, grace, and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You are the One who sowed, and You are the One who gathers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, open our eyes to see the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the name of the Lord, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ISAAC AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The book of Galatians shows us that the principle of the believer's living is being an Isaac, one who inherits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isaac entered into glory, and Christians will also enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as Isaac was begotten through promise, Christians are also children through promise, and just as Isaac became an heir, Christians are also made heirs of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans speaks of sinners receiving grace, whereas Galatians speaks of sinners not remaining in the same place but going on in grace after receiving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans speaks of initial grace, while Galatians speaks of ongoing and sustaining grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The apostle said that having begun by the Spirit, one should not be perfected by the flesh 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The matter is not what we are going to do or what we are going to give to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Grace is not our striving to be good or changing for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Grace is our looking to the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not a matter of what we should do but a matter of looking to His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Isaac was an heir, not an initiator.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same is true with Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GOD'S INHERITANCE THE WORK OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament shows us two parts in the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, we are in Christ, and second, Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One is a union in Christ, and the other is a union in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Historically, first we are in Christ and then Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why the Lord said in John, "He who abides in Me and I in him..."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our abiding in Christ includes all the facts related to our being in Christ, while Christ's abiding in us is related to the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a Christian abides in Christ, he touches all the facts related to being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ abides in a Christian, he touches Christ as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being in Christ involves the inheritance of all that Christ has accomplished in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ's being in us involves our receiving of all that Christ is and has today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are in Christ, everything that Christ has accomplished from the past to the present becomes our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christ is in us, everything that Christ will accomplish between now and the future becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRISTIANS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For a Christian to be in Christ means that God has put him in a new position; he now has a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"The Christian in Christ" is something that spans from the past to the present; whereas, "Christ in the Christian" is something that spans from today to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The former was accomplished once for all in Christ, and the latter continues from here until eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus" 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that God has delivered us out of the old man, the self, the world, and Satan into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 1 through 4 tells us that man is wrong in his conduct, while Romans 5 through 8 tells us that man is wrong in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A man's conduct is wrong because his person is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why man has to die.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are crucified with Christ, we believe that we will live and ascend with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the law of the Spirit of life, we will live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension can terminate the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But how can we be crucified, raised, and ascended?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not have to die, resurrect, or ascend by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He has joined us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"But of Him you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is one of the most precious verses in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to realize how important this is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Suppose you put a banknote in the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the hymnal is thrown into the fire, the banknote will be burned as well.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you mail the hymnal to England, the banknote will go to England as well, because the banknote has been joined to the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The same principle applies in our crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our natural self, whether good or evil, meek or rash, patient or impatient is crucified in Christ; it is terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now we are resurrected in Him and in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we do not need to look at what we were or are outside of Christ.</S>
