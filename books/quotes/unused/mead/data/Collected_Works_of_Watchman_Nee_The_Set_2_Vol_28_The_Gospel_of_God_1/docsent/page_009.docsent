   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO GOD'S LOVE, GRACE, AND MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Tonight we will consider God's love and grace, and we will also touch the subject of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times the Old Testament says that salvation is of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that salvation does not originate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since sin is committed by man we would naturally think that salvation also originates in man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But even the thought of our salvation did not originate with us; rather, it originated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although man has sinned and is destined for perdition, it is not his intention to seek salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Though he has sinned and ought to perish, it was God who took up the thought of saving him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the Old Testament mentions again and again that salvation is of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason for this is that it is God who wants to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man has never wanted to save himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is salvation of Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is God interested in man?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a general way, we can say that it is because God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But more specifically, it is because God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God did not love man, He would not need to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Salvation is accomplished because, on the one hand, man has sinned and, on the other hand, God has loved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If man had not sinned, there would be no place and no way for the love of God to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And if man had sinned but God had not loved, nothing would have been achieved either.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Salvation is accomplished and the gospel is preached because on the one hand God has loved and on the other hand man has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man's sin shows us man's need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's love shows us God's provision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is only the need without the provision, nothing can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if there is the provision without the need, the provision will be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Salvation is accomplished and the gospel is preached due to the two greatest facts in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first is that man has sinned and the second is that God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are two immutable facts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are two facts that the Bible emphasizes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you drop either of these two ends, salvation will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You do not need to drop both ends.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as one end is gone, there will be no possibility for salvation to be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has love and man has sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of these two facts, there is salvation and there is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>GOD'S LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible never fails to point out the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our Bible study this time, we will cover the truth of the gospel only in a sketchy way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will mention a lot of things, but will not consider them in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Tonight I cannot cover every aspect concerning the love of God found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can mention this matter only briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must consider three aspects of the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And third, the expression of God's love is in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God Is Love</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us come to the first point: God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is recorded in 1 John 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here it does not say that God loves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nor does it say that God may love, or that God can love, or that God has loved or will love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, it says that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What does it mean to say that God is love?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It means that God Himself, His nature and His being, is love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we can say that God has a substance, then God's substance is love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The greatest revelation of the Bible is that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This revelation is what man needs the most.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man has many conjectures and theories about God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We ponder all the time about what kind of God our God is, what kind of heart our God has, what intentions God has toward man, what God Himself is like.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You can ask anyone about his idea of God, and he will give you his concept.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He will think that God is this kind of God or that kind of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the idols in the world and all the images made by man are products of man's imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Man thinks that God is a fierce God or a severe God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He pictures God this way and that way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Man is always trying to reason and to explore what God is like.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order to correct the different conjectures man has concerning God, He manifests Himself in the light of the gospel and shows man that He is not an unapproachable or unfathomable God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is God then?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This statement will not be clear to you unless I give an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose that there is a patient person.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He has patience no matter what he encounters and no matter how difficult or bad the conditions are.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For such a person, we cannot say that he has acted patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The adverb patiently cannot be used to describe him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nor can we say that he is patient, using an adjective.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must say that he is patience itself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Perhaps we would not refer to him by his name.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead, behind his back we would say that Patience has come or that Patience has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we say that God is love, we mean that love is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is love from inside to outside.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, we would not say that God is loving, using an adjective, or that God loves, using a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Rather, we would say that God is love, applying the noun to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In our friend Patience we cannot find rashness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The man is patience itself; he is not simply patient.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is just a lump of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Would you think that with such a person there could be rashness?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Could he lose his temper?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Could he exchange sharp words with others?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is impossible for him to do such things because there is no element in his nature to do such things.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is no such thing as temper in his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is no such thing as rashness in his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He is simply patience.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The same is true with God, who is love.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God as love is the greatest revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>For every Christian, the greatest thing to know in the Bible is that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is impossible for God to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If God hates, He will not only have a conflict with whomever He hates, but will also have a conflict with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If God hated any one of us here today, He would not have a problem with that one alone; He would have a problem with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God must develop a problem with Himself before He can hate or do anything in a way that is not in love.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Although these three words are most simple, they give us the greatest revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The nature of God, the life-essence of God, is just love.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He cannot do anything otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He loves, and at the same time, He is love.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If you are a sinner today, you may wonder what you must do before God will love you.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Many people do not know God's mind toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They do not know what God is thinking or what intentions God has.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Many think that they should do something or that they should suffer or should be very conscientious before they can please God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>However, only those who are in darkness and do not know God will think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If there were no gospel today, you would be able to think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>But now that the gospel is here, you cannot think this way anymore, for the gospel tells us that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We human beings are nothing but hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>For us to love is extremely difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Likewise, it is equally difficult for God to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>You may think that it is difficult to love and that you do not know how to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But it is impossible for God to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>You have no way to love, and God has no way to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>God is love, and for Him to hate is for Him to act contrary to His nature, which is impossible for Him to do.</S>
