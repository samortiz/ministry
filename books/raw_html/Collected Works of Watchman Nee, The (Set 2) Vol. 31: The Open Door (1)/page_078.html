<h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Greetings to Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>Praise our God for bringing me from Hou-Ma to Hankow in three days and three nights. He gave me a burden for the need to come to Hankow, so I came not long after. Hallelujah! He is Lord! There are lessons for me to learn here. Please pray for me. I am an ignorant and stubborn person, but God has loved me. How this has happened is unimaginable and inconceivable to me. May the Lord give me the heart to be faithful unto death in serving Him. Glory be to Him. Amen. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sisters Wang and Chang.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Kuo Bu-yueh<br />February 9</p><h2 class="head2">Nan-ch'ang, Kiangsi Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Philip in the Lord:</p><p>Last year you stayed in Dr. Stearns's house in Shanghai. He spoke of you to me, but I did not have time to visit you. I left in August with a few brothers who were with the medical aid team. We went to Wusih and Nanking and worked there for three months. We took the train to Nan-ch'ang at the end of November. Last month the Red Cross changed its organization and regrouped the two groups of workers from our school into three medical units. We are temporarily working in Nan-ch'ang, but we do not know where we will be sent in the future. I met the following brothers and sisters in Nanking: Chou You-sheng, Liu Guo-jieh, Dung Shen-ying, and Liu Guo-hsiang. I also had time to attend a few meetings. After arriving in Nan-ch'ang, I met Brother Liu and Sister Dung. They went to Ch'ang-sha last month. I really miss the brothers and sisters in the Shanghai Medical College and Dr. Stearns, even though I know that they are under God's care. Have you received any letters from Dr. Stearns? Have his wife and son arrived in Shanghai? Is there still a meeting in Wen-teh Lane? I really ask God to specially protect everyone who belongs to Him in this age and to give us new light so that we may walk in His will. I am sending an order form to the Gospel Book Room to send me three copies of each issue of The Open Door. Please send me one copy each of Issue Nos. 92&mdash;94 of the local newsletter and the first issue of The Open Door. I will return them after I have read them. I know there is a shortage of them. Please tell Brother Chou You-sheng that I will send him the copy of The Light of Human Life which I borrowed from him in Nanking. Greet him for me also. This place is not too bad, but there is no meeting on the Lord's Day. Where is Brother Tang Shou-ling? Is Hankow still peaceful? Greet all the brothers and sisters for me, even though I do not know many of them. Peace in the Lord! Isaiah 26:3-4.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Yu Nan-geng<br />January 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Dr. Stearns's whole family is now in Shanghai and is safe. The meetings in Wen-teh Lane continue as usual. Brother Chang Kwang-rong is still in Shanghai. We have not heard any news from Brother Tang Shou-ling recently. I will ask Brother Lan Tsi-yi to send you The Open Door and the local newsletters from Hankow&mdash;Philip.)</p><h2 class="head2">Hsiang-Tan, Hunan Province</h2><p>Greetings to Mr. X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your express letter and postcard. I intended to answer them a long time ago, but I have been cleaning out materials and other things, so I have delayed until today. Please forgive me for the Lord's sake. I wrote a letter to Miss Lee a long time ago. I also answered Brother Han and Miss Tso's letters when I received them. Please do not worry. Five other sisters came with me to Zhen-Chiang Hospital, and we are still together. They are all well. There is a seventy to eighty percent chance that we will go to Nan-ning in Kwangsi province. We probably will not stay together wherever we go in the future. We will probably spread out into four clinics, so we five will have to separate to four different places. I have no difficulties at present and am doing fine financially. However, I will have to pass through a difficult portion on the way ahead. Even though my heart is ready to break, I hope the union with the Lord is not broken. I only ask that God would keep me. Thank and praise Him. Since He has opened up this way for me, I hope that He will gain something from it. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>The weak one in the Lord,<br />Chien Sin-hsian<br />January 24</p><p>(This letter was mailed from the Hunan-Kweichow Railway Clinic, Hunan, to Hankow. Perhaps Sister Chien has already gone to Nan-ning, Kwangsi province&mdash;Editor.)</p>
