<p>In Isaiah 62:6-7 Jehovah said, &ldquo;Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, / I have appointed watchmen; / All day and all night / They will never keep silent. / You who remind Jehovah, / Do not be dumb; / And do not give Him quiet / Until He establishes / And until He makes Jerusalem / A praise in the earth.&rdquo; According to these verses, in order for God to make Jerusalem a praise, He first needs to appoint watchmen to remind Him of this matter all day and all night. Had the watchmen prayed ceaselessly, they could have caused Jehovah to work ceaselessly. Here is a principle: without man&rsquo;s prayer, God cannot work. If we pray ceaselessly, we make God work ceaselessly. God wants to work, but He needs us to pray, to co-work, and to coordinate with Him.</p>
<p>Verse 11 of chapter 45 says, &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah, / The Holy One of Israel and the One who formed him, / Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons, / And concerning the work of My hands, command Me.&rdquo; How amazing it is that we can command God concerning His work, as if we are the master and He is the servant! Usually the command of the master comes first, and the work of the servant follows. The master commands the servant, and the servant obeys. Without the master&rsquo;s command, the servant has nothing to do. Similarly, in prayer our position is active, and God&rsquo;s position is passive. Good prayers are prayers that command God. Such prayers are up to the standard. God will do what we want Him to do, and He will do it according to the desire in us that expresses Him.</p>
<p>This is a great spiritual principle: our prayer comes first, takes the lead, and God&rsquo;s work follows. Our prayer takes the initiative, and God&rsquo;s work fulfills. Prayer is crucial. The purpose of prayer is to co-work with God, that is, to coordinate with God&rsquo;s work such that it initiates what He fulfills. We pray, and God fulfills. Our praying is our ordering God, our commanding Him, and His fulfilling is His carrying out our order, His obeying our command. The extent to which we command is the extent to which He works.</p>
<p>In Ezekiel 22:30 Jehovah said, &ldquo;I sought a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the breach before Me for the sake of the land so that I would not destroy it, but I found no one.&rdquo; This indicates that God wanted to save the children of Israel from their desolation, but He had no way to act because He did not find among them one who would pray for this matter. This can be compared to having a translator but no speaker. Without a speaker the translator cannot work even if many saints are in the meeting hall. God wanted to save the children of Israel, but He did not find anyone among them who would stand in the breach before Him, that is, stand to pray on their behalf. God can work only when someone among His children prays. He cannot work if no one prays. This shows that God&rsquo;s work depends on our prayer.</p>
<p>We should never think that our prayers are the source of God&rsquo;s desire to do something. We have the wrong concept that until we implore God to bless the church, He has no such desire. In actuality, God knows the condition of the church and wants to bless the church, but He cannot, because no one prays; no one co-works with Him to be a pioneer. He will not begin to work until at least one person rises up and prays, cries out, as a pioneer, a leader, in God&rsquo;s work. God has many things that He wants to do, but we must pray.</p>
<p>Daniel 9:2-4 says, &ldquo;I, Daniel, understood by means of the Scriptures the number of the years, which came as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, that is, seventy years. So I set my face toward the Lord God to seek Him in prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. And I prayed to Jehovah my God and confessed.&rdquo; Daniel understood God&rsquo;s will for Jerusalem from the Scriptures and prayed for God&rsquo;s will according to the Scriptures. Daniel knew how to pray because he knew how to draw near to God, to contact God, to absorb God, and to let God express Himself. Daniel&rsquo;s preciousness was not related to his prophesying but to his ability to pray. He could prophesy because he knew how to pray. His prayers touched, contacted, absorbed, and expressed God. Hence, his prayers were his co-working with God.</p>
<p>Daniel was God&rsquo;s co-worker on earth. He was considerate of God&rsquo;s heart and contacted God. He lived in God and let God live in him. Daniel was a person in union with God. As a result, Daniel could co-work with God, coordinate with God, and be God&rsquo;s expression when there was a great turn of events on earth. Daniel understood from God&rsquo;s Word that the desolation of the children of Israel would last seventy years, and that at the conclusion of the seventy years God would bring the children of Israel from the land of their captivity to the land of Israel for them to rebuild Jerusalem. He knew God&rsquo;s intention and prayed for it with fasting. He knew God was about to move on earth, so he became God&rsquo;s expression in order to coordinate with God through prayer. The extent to which Daniel prayed was the extent to which God worked. God did what Daniel prayed for. The return of the children of Israel to Jerusalem was God&rsquo;s fulfilling of Daniel&rsquo;s prayer. The children of Israel&rsquo;s return from captivity was the issue of Daniel&rsquo;s prayer. Hence, Daniel&rsquo;s prayer co-worked with God, opened a way for God&rsquo;s work, caused God to work, and led God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>The prophet Samuel knew that God&rsquo;s work on earth requires the coordination of man&rsquo;s prayer. Therefore, Samuel told the children of Israel, &ldquo;As for me, far be it from me that I would sin against Jehovah by ceasing to pray for you&rdquo; (1 Sam. 12:23). Samuel seemed to say that the children of Israel did not want God and that only he was left to live for God. Samuel was a Nazarite who had always lived in God&rsquo;s presence and understood God&rsquo;s heart. Hence, he was God&rsquo;s co-worker on earth. Had he not prayed for the children of Israel, God would not have had a way to work among them. If Samuel had not prayed, he would have hindered God&rsquo;s work, which would have been a sin, an offense against God.</p>
<p>After reading Exodus, some people think that God did not like the Israelites when they were in Egypt but that when the Israelites could no longer bear the oppression of the Egyptians, they entreated God and softened His heart; as a result, He had mercy on them and delivered them from Egypt. This, however, is not according to the record in the Bible. Exodus 3:7 says that God knew &ldquo;their sorrows.&rdquo; This means that God knew the sorrows of the children of Israel and wanted to deliver them, but He had not delivered them, because until Exodus 2:23-25 they had not entreated Him concerning their deliverance. Their entreating and praying was to initiate God&rsquo;s deliverance. God wanted to deliver them, but He needed them to entreat Him and pray. Therefore, their praying opened the way for God&rsquo;s work. God could deliver them when they prayed.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Meaning and Purpose of Prayer &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
