   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE WORLD SITUATION IN RELATION TO GOD'S MOVE ON EARTH 3 Scripture Reading: Acts 17:24-27; Dan 2:21; 4:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For God to carry out His purpose, He has arranged the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>History is meaningful when we realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just a few years before Christ was born, the Roman Empire became fully established.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everything was ready for Christ to be born according to the prophecies in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why, for example, did Mary have to go to Bethlehem?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She was in Galilee, but Augustus issued a decree that required her to go to Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If Christ had been born in Nazareth, where Mary was living, it would have been contrary to the prophecy Micah 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Roman Empire also provided a way for the gospel to be spread.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later, Germany was used by God to support the Reformation, and Great Britain in more recent times was raised up by God to further carry out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After defeating the Spanish Armada in 1588, she became the leading world power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through her the gospel was spread throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of her unfaithfulness and pride, however, she has lost her preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Britain's unfairness was demonstrated when the League of Nations was in effect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The League had been formed after World War I under the direction of President Woodrow Wilson, though the United States did not join.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Britain, France, Japan, and China all belonged, along with many other nations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Britain and France were in favor of the League of Nations as the means to keep Germany under restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The other nations wanted to be protected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1931 Japan invaded Manchuria, which was part of China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When China appealed to the League of Nations, the League sent a mission to Manchuria under the chairmanship of the British Lord Lytton to investigate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the League of Nations was not able to do anything to correct the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>JAPAN</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This weakness in dealing with Japanese aggression emboldened Japan to invade northern China in 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The United States had previously realized the need for a strong China to maintain the balance of power on the other side of the Pacific.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, under the United States' leadership, a treaty had been drawn up in 1921 and 1922, respecting the independence and territorial integrity of China and promising to maintain an Open Door there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Japan was one of the signatories to this Nine-Power Treaty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Japan invaded China, Roosevelt, who was President at the time, reminded Japan of its signature on this treaty and demanded that Japan withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Japan refused.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>China again appealed to the League of Nations, which again proved unable to help.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1941 Japan sent a delegation to the United States to gain more favorable treatment for Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Negotiations were still going on when Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the United States declared war on Japan; there was only one vote against it in Congress.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A few days later Congress also declared war on Germany and Italy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Chinese were joyful that after four years of trying to resist Japan, they were finally being joined by the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With the aid of its top-notch generals Eisenhower in Europe, MacArthur in the Far East, and Marshall as Chief of Staff the war was won.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>RUSSIA</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Russia in territory and population was the largest country in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While the other European nations were striving to gain world markets for their goods, however, Russia was still backward.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their ways were Oriental, not Western.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During the reign of Peter the Great, Russia became a great power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It adopted western ways and gained access to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible speaks of Russia as Gog and Magog see Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>38; 39; Rev 20 and says that this people will be rebellious against God till the end of the thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The territory assigned to them is in the frozen north.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The czars tried again and again to gain a warm water outlet to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They tried to get a port on the Black Sea so that they could go through the Aegean Sea, between Greece and Turkey, into the Mediterranean and out through Gibraltar into the Atlantic Ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Britain prevented this by persuading the Turks to watch over the Aegean and by using Malta and Gibraltar to guard the Mediterranean.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Suez Canal was built in Egypt, the British also controlled this, again preventing the Russians from gaining an outlet to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The czars then tried to get through the Persian Gulf into the Indian Ocean, but once again the British thwarted their efforts by influencing Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Still with the aim of getting a warm water port, the czars had begun work in 1891 on the Trans-Siberian railroad.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It began operating in 1901, though the last section was not completed till 1916.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It extended from Moscow to Vladivostok on the Sea of Japan, was some five thousand miles in length, and cost millions of dollars to build.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The czars were also able to gain eastern Siberia from China because the foolish emperor considered such a frozen land was not worth keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Siberian railroad extended through this area also.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the czars again got the emperor to agree to allow Russia to build the Chinese Eastern Railway across Manchuria and partially to control the province.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 1898 Russia leased the Liaotung Peninsula from China; the railroad was extended into that area.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the tip of the peninsula the Russians built the commercial port of Dairen and the naval base of Port Arthur.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This meant the Russian navy had ships at Port Arthur.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This was just across the sea from my home town of Chefoo.</S>
