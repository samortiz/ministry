   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RECOVERY OF THE PRIESTHOOD A. There Being No Problem in the Early Churches</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The danger that haunted the nation of Israel is the same problem that has confronted the church over the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the time of the Lord's departure until the time of the writing of Revelation and a little beyond that point, all of God's children were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone who considered himself a child of God was a priest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was no problem then.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was no problem from the first century up through the third century.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Individually, there were isolated problems here and there, but as a whole there was no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here and there some of God's children refused to be priests, but as a whole we did not see any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as a person was a child of God, he was a priest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. The Church's Nature Being Changed after</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>the Roman Empire's Acceptance of Christianity</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Roman Empire endorsed Christianity, many people began to creep in. There were material benefits in believing in the Lord; one became a fellow believer of the emperor and a brother of Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Originally, the Lord's charge was, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God" Matt 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now both the things of Caesar and the things of God were rendered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indeed was a big victory for Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Constantine was converted to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The result was a gradual but significant shift for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Believers were no longer the same as those who professed their faith at an earlier age.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the ten periods of persecution under the reign of Rome, tens of thousands of Christians suffered martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was not easy to pretend to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But then the situation totally changed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It became fashionable to be a believer and to share the same faith as the emperor and to call him one's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When this shift occurred, many decided to join Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, the number of people increased, while the number of priests remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is easy to creep into the Christian fold, but it is absolutely impossible to creep into God's service.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. A Separation between the Spiritual Ones</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>and the Worldly Ones</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church witnessed a drastic change in the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During that period, many who joined the church were either unbelievers or half believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They appeared to be believers, yet they held worldly power in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They had no desire to serve the Lord in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the most they were saved, but they could not serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Spontaneously, some spiritual ones rose up to take care of the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The others then said, "You do it!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Go and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are the secular ones."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word secular was introduced in the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some would attend to earthly affairs, while others would attend to spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result many served God, but many more no longer served.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the time of the apostles in the first century, every believer served the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From the fourth century on, men began to say, "We are merely God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We attend to our own affairs in the world and keep our positions in society.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once in a while, we give a little money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This should qualify us as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Let the spiritual ones take care of the spiritual things for us."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From that time forward, the church followed the footsteps of the nation of Israel; it worshipped "the golden calf" and created an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No longer were all of God's people priests.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some became merely His people but not His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, clergymen in the Roman Catholic Church are called priests.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In China they are known as fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These so-called fathers are actually called priests.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some state churches follow the example of the Roman Catholic Church and give their pastors the title of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who tend to earthly affairs are called God's people, while those who manage spiritual things are called priests.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church has been divided into priests and people.</S>
