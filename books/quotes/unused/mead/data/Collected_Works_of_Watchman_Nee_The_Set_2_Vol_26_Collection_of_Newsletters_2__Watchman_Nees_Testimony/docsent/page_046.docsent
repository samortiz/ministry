   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEWS FROM KIRIN, MANCHURIA One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peace to my brother in the Lord, Brother Luan:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It has been more than a month since we parted on the ship at Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I remember you every time I pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank and praise the Lord that He led me to Hangchow and caused me to obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I remember how rebellious and disobedient I used to be.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now God Himself has enlightened me so that I completely obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before I went to Hangchow, I thought, "I definitely cannot enter the Little Flock' even though I was baptized in Ta Chiang."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Chiang Shun T'ien exhorted me to go the meetings in Hangchow, and I said at the time that I would go, but I never went.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thanks be to the Father who loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He did not let me go and caused old Brother T'ien P'ing Fang to come to Kirin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He only said one word, and I changed my mind about going to the conference in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I used to oppose the "Little Flock" to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I did not only oppose it myself, but I also told others to oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, I was very willing to read books by Brother Nee, and I often told others about them, but I was unwilling to go that way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At first I felt that the "Little Flock" was a sect, but now I know that if I call others a little flock, I myself am part of the big flock the world and am not saved!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thank the Lord for allowing me to completely understand the meaning of Luke 12:32 in this conference in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It refers to all those in the Lord from the past and present and all over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are those purchased by the Lord's blood, all the believers with the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It also helped me to understand that sects are a sin which divide the Lord's Body into thousands of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I also understand that the life I used to live, like a life in Haran, was a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord; He caused me to leave these hateful denominations and walk in His way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After returning from Shanghai, the Lord led three of us safely back to Kirin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We did not meet with any difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After returning to Kirin, we suffered a little.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One person came to exhort us, and another person came to visit, and some from the denominations despised us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord led us all through these things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I also went to Hsin Ying Kou Bible Seminary and resigned from my position as a financial board member.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Last Wednesday a denomination in Kirin also elected Mr. Hua Su Sheng and myself as deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We did not accept.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sister Chang En Chao resigned from her position as a worker in the deacons' meeting last Wednesday thirty-five dollars a month so she could walk in the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way is narrow and difficult; please pray for us much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Three Lord's Days ago I went to Changchun for the table meeting and gave a short testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are three brothers and two sisters in Kirin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not have a table meeting yet, but we meet on Thursday and the Lord's Day evening for prayer and Bible study meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday evenings we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are also two brothers from the denominations who come to pray with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the denominations in Kirin are afraid of us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They say, "The Little Flock has come, so we must be more careful; they steal lambs like the Seventh-day Adventists."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There were a few times when I wanted to send a letter to the denominations in Kirin, regarding my intention to leave the sects, but I have not done it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother T'ien said I should wait quietly first.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It will still not be too late to wait for Brothers Nee and Luan to come.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am afraid of frustration from the denominations, so I have not done it yet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Tonight is Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During the prayer meeting we received your petition booklet and a letter from Brother Ma saying that Brother Nee's illness was better and that he would come to Manchuria in February.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We heard before that he would come in December.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now it has changed to February.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It must be February of next year, right?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Chiang Shun T'ien's letter said that Brother Nee was waiting to get well from his sickness before coming to Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I think he must mean that he will come after his illness is better.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are praying unceasingly to the Lord to heal Brother Nee's illness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We also are begging God to take away Satan's frustrations so that you can come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The brothers and sisters desperately need you to come!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Presently we feel very lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We really do not want to enter the denominational cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since returning from Shanghai, I have not gone once.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the few brothers and sisters really want the Lord to quickly give us a place to meet and to raise up more people to walk in the way with us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brother, the work in Manchuria is very critical.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need you brothers to come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We believe there will be a big change in the denominations in Kirin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God will call out His people personally to maintain His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are looking to the Lord and waiting on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We ask Him to arrange all matters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord's grace is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please greet the brothers and sisters in Hangchow for me!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Luke Kuo</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>December 7, 1934 in Kirin</S>
