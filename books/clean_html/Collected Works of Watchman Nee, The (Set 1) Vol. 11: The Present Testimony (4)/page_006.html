<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Moses Acknowledging Himself<br>to Have No Eloquence</H2><P>Now God encouraged him. This is the resurrection that I mentioned yesterday. Moses' former courage, wisdom, and power had all died. Now all his courage, wisdom, and power were received from God's hand anew. This is resurrection. The forty years were like Aaron's rod which lay before Jehovah in the tabernacle overnight. Once the night is over, everything that has died is resurrected. In God's work everything must pass through death and resurrection before it can be used. When we see a young man with knowledge, courage, and competence, we say, "If this man were saved, he would be very useful in God's hand." But his knowledge, courage, and competence are things that are useless in God's hand. God does not need wisdom any more than He needs foolishness. The wise should bring their wisdom through death, and the foolish should also bring their foolishness through death. God can only use those things that are in the realm of resurrection. Every natural thing must pass through death before one can receive something new and resurrected from God. This is a great principle in the work. Without resurrection there can be no work. Moses had to go through forty years before he realized that all the wisdom and power that he previously had was useless. He had died, and now God wanted to bless him with the courage and wisdom that comes from resurrection.</P><P>In Exodus 3:12 God promised to be with Moses. In verse 13, Moses again asked, "When I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is His name? what shall I say unto them?" Moses dared not consider himself knowledgeable or able to tell anyone anything. He had been dealt with by God. He had no presumptions, no ideas, and he dared not act recklessly. This was why he inquired of Jehovah in this way. He had learned the lesson. "For I have not spoken from Myself; but the Father who sent Me, He Himself has given Me commandment, what to say and what to speak...The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak" (John 12:49-50). He now knew that even what he spoke had to be according to God's commandment. Many times our words are not restricted by God! This is especially true with eloquent people, who think that they are capable of speaking. But those who have been dealt with by God know how to be taught during their speaking; they will no longer be self-confident. Later God told Moses His name. But even though Moses had God's name, he still dared not go. He was afraid that the children of Israel would not believe his word (Exo. 4:1). Formerly he dared to go out by himself to slay the Egyptian. When he saw the Israelites striving together, he dared to exhort them boldly. Yet now when Jehovah commanded him to go, he was timid and afraid. His fleshly boldness was entirely gone. The kind of courage which came from himself was no longer there. He did not trust in himself anymore; he became humble. His humility was almost to the point of withdrawal. Genuine humility and the lack of self-confidence are the expression of spirituality. Now he had learned. He knew that he could not do anything by himself among the Israelites. Because of this, Jehovah encouraged him a third time, and gave him the miracles of turning the rod into a serpent, turning water into blood, and making his hand leprous. God did this in order to cause the people to believe Moses. But Moses asked the fourth time, "O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" (4:10). These words were completely contrary to the words in Acts 7:22 which say that Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in words and works. Moses' excuse was that he could not speak and was not eloquent. Therefore, Jehovah caused Aaron to be his mouth. We have to realize that the Bible does not record later that Aaron came out to speak to the people for Moses. The Bible always records that Moses himself spoke to the people. Why? Because through many years, Moses had learned and realized that God would not use any fleshly eloquence, power, or wisdom. Unless the Spirit moves to give a person eloquence and wisdom, all of his power is useless in God's work. Spiritual power is absolutely necessary. Brothers, do we all know how to be dealt with by God to the extent that our fleshly eloquence is put aside? We would rather not use the cunning words, the clever expressions, and the clear illustrations to help others understand better the cross of the Lord and His victory. Have we been dealt with by the cross to the extent that we die to our own speaking? Our words will indeed expose how we actually are; they will show the kind of persons we are. God needs us to see that even if we have excellence of speech, it does not bear fruit and is not of the spirit. If we do not allow God to gain the victory in our speaking, God's work will suffer greater damage.</P><P>Moses had two kinds of excuses here. The first was that he was not eloquent and was slow of speech. The second was that even after he talked with God that day, he still could not speak. He had completely denied himself before God. He reckoned that nothing of himself could stand before God. He had already learned a deep lesson. In those forty years, he left behind everything that was natural and of the self.</P>
