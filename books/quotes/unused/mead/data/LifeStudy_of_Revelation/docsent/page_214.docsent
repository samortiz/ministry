   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Raiment of Embroidery in Psalm 45</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two garments are also seen in Psalm 45.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this psalm the queen has two garments vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>13-14 : one corresponds to the objective righteousness for our salvation and the other to the subjective righteousness for our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The latter is equivalent to the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11 and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The queen in Psalm 45 signifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Her first garment is of wrought gold, and her second is raiment of embroidery Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Bible gold signifies the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time of our salvation we received a golden garment that enabled us to be in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition to this, we need another garment, a garment of embroidery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This embroidery signifies the transforming work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Holy Spirit today is working on us to transform us just like an embroiderer puts many stitches into cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we have the first garment, our second garment is now being prepared under the embroidering work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This garment will qualify us to see Christ at His judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Day by day we are under the needle, the transformation, of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How we need this second garment!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However serious this matter may be, most Christians only care for the first garment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some even say, As long as we are justified, redeemed, and saved, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not listen to this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may be all right as far as salvation is concerned, but what about the reward?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You not only need justification you also need approval.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you appear before the judgment seat of Christ, will He approve of you?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew 22:14 says very clearly that some will be chosen and not others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only those who have the second garment produced by the embroidering work of the Holy Spirit will be chosen and qualified to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. Bringing in the Reign of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 6 the voice of the great multitude proclaims, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reign of God, the kingdom, is related to the marriage of the Lamb, and the marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ the Bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the Bride with the overcoming believers will be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Simultaneously, the kingdom of God will come.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This corresponds to the Lord s prophecy in Matthew 26:29.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The wedding will bring in the reign of the Lord, the kingdom, because all the guests invited to the wedding will be both the corporate Bride and the co-kings of the Groom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bridegroom, who will take the whole earth as His kingdom, certainly needs many sub-kings to be His co-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All His co-kings will be His corporate Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am not certain how long the wedding feast will last.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The wedding itself, which will take place in the air, will last a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the wedding, there will be the wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A wedding feast is always much longer than the wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although I believe that the wedding feast will last a thousand years, the Bible does not give us the ground to say this with full assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To the Lord, a thousand years are as one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Matthew 22 indicates that the wedding feast will be the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To us, the thousand years of the millennial kingdom will be a wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone invited to the wedding feast will also participate in the thousand-year reign as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our King will be the Groom; we, His co-kings, will be His Bride; and the thousand years will be our honeymoon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ s thousand-year reign will be our feast.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am quite certain that many Christians will not receive the reward of reigning with Christ in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although you may be saved, you must become an overcomer in order to receive the kingdom as your reward.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For the overcomers, reigning with Christ in His kingdom will be the wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>V. THE MARRIAGE DINNER OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 9 says, And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And he said to me, These are the true words of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The marriage dinner of the Lamb here is the wedding feast in Matthew 22:2 Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>. It will be a reward to the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only the overcomers will be invited to it, not all the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The five foolish virgins in Matthew 25:8-13 will miss it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, to be invited to the wedding feast of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The overcoming believers invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb will also be the Bride of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The blessing referred to in verse 9 is the blessing of participating in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Matthew 22:14 says, For many are called but few are chosen, and Revelation 17:14 says, They who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To be called is one thing, and to be chosen is another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who will follow the Lord to fight against Antichrist will not only be called, but also chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although we have the assurance that we have been called, we do not yet have the assurance that we shall be chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This will be decided at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After we have been raptured, we shall stand before the Lord at the judgment seat, and He will decide whether or not we are qualified to be chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only those who are chosen will be invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A TESTIMONY OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verse 10 says, And I fell before his feet to worship him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>And he said to me, Don t do that!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I am a fellow-slave of yours and of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Worship God!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This verse indicates that the Bride, the invited guests, are the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although the church today should be the testimony of Jesus, some among us are below the standard of the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, at the time of verse 10 all the invited overcomers will be fully up to this standard.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After the Lord has gained His Bride, He will be able to boast to Satan and to the whole universe, saying, This Bride is My testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Verse 10 says that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The entire book of Revelation has a spirit, and this spirit is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The spirit of the prophecy is the reality, substance, disposition, characteristic, of the prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Thus, the testimony of Jesus is the reality, substance, disposition, characteristic, of the prophecy of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Today, the testimony of Jesus is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, not all the members of the church have reached the Lord s standard.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, the Lord must wait until He has the Bride before He can declare to Satan, This is My testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is perfect and complete to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, the Bride is the reality, the substance, and the element of the prophecy of the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This book is for the church life, for the Bride.</S>
