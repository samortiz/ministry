   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need for Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For this reason, during the conferences in both Shanghai and Foochow, we paid much attention to the matter of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nothing will work without coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past, we were all going our own way, but without coordination nothing can be done properly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one should act independently; everyone must give himself to be properly coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that the gospel will spread quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, I believe that it will be easy for us to take over the whole of China.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For instance, if the brothers in Foochow are faithful, it will be very easy for them to take over Fukien province and the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the brothers in other localities are also faithful and learn to take this way, they will also be able to take over their places.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today we have found the way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now it is altogether a matter of the person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way cannot be clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not see the principle of Jerusalem, we will feel that there is something in the Word of God which does not fit; it seems as if there is some problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we have to declare that the whole book of Acts fits in very well; there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, each time I read the book of Acts now, I marvel at the way Peter conducted himself in the first part.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I think Peter has been unjustly accused for two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter's going out and coming back to Jerusalem was altogether correct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Undoubtedly, there are centers for God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Ministry of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No Longer Being a Problem</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we take this way, the matter of the ministry of the word will no longer be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All we have to do is maintain such a ministry in one central locality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The other localities need to be led to take care of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There will be no problem with the ministry of the word if the local ones are the ones that are taking care of the matter themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is for this cause that we in Kuling are preparing a place for training.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the future we will bring all the good, prospective ones from all the churches here to receive some training.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will send them back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, I will do my work and you will do your work, each one attending to his own work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that we can soon get through this way and strong testimonies can be built up continuously in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Foundation of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The foundation of all the work today is here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If this becomes confused, everything will be confused, and we will revert back to the situation before our gathering in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Hankow we only saw the matter of the church; at that time we did not see the matter of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now the way of the work is before us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have the right people and the mercy of the Lord is with us, within a few years the gospel will be spread all over China.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe this is a great eventuality to preach the gospel to all of China.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unless we take this way, the situation will remain the same for fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I acknowledge that much of God's blessing has been in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the past I have said that God always saves people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a matter of fact, God has saved quite a number of people in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, I always feel that this is not enough; we still have not saved enough people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Recently, we all gave ourselves to study the Bible again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I myself have read God's Word once or twice again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I find God's Word becoming so very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the past we only saw the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We did not see the way of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the way of the work is not proper, the way of the church is not proper either.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We thank God for His mercy upon us that today He has opened our eyes to see this way after so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers in a locality must always bear their responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They must practice coordination, and they must migrate to other places group by group to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a very simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jerusalem had great success in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before God, Jerusalem represents the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The heavenly Jerusalem represents the church, and the earthly Jerusalem also represents the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Peter was always working there, and as a result, many people went out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Never do we see the gospel coming to an end when the people left.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The gospel will go on continually.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is exceedingly glorious.</S>
