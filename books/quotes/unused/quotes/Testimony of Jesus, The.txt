Soon after the day of Pentecost, Peter preached that Christ was not only the Savior but also the cornerstone for God's building
When Peter said, 'You are the Christ,' the Lord Jesus told him that he was a stone, and that He would build His church
The revelation of Jesus Christ is not merely an objective record revealed by Him; it is a subjective revelation
Objectively speaking, this book is the word of Christ, but subjectively, the entire book is a picture of Jesus Christ
To speak of all the small characters is to miss the mark of the painting, since the painting as a whole is simply a portrait of the lion
If a painting portrays only the main subject without a background or environment, we would think that the artist is not very skillful
The twenty-two chapters of this book are a good painting of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, but they also show an environment
When John saw the situation in heaven, he wept, but when the Lion of the tribe of Judah came, there was great rejoicing
Eventually, the Lion as the Lamb marries a bride, the bride becomes a square city, and the Lamb sits on the throne with God
Out of this throne flows a river of water of life, bright as crystal, and in the river the tree of life is growing
Revelation 1:1 says that God gave this revelation to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place
If we know the revelation of Christ, we will realize that this is not merely a prophecy of events which will transpire in the future
To show Jesus to the people in our locality, there is the need of a church in our locality that testifies who Jesus is
If we show someone an unclear picture of a person, it will not be a proper testimony of him with his image and appearance
The more we are only for salvation and joy, the less we will enjoy them, and if we are only for peace, peace will not come
People in America may have better homes and cars than others have, but they do not have more peace, joy, salvation, or spiritual welfare
We can also talk to brothers throughout the country and even throughout the world by a long-distance telephone call
Many of us can testify that before we came into the churches, we knew of Jesus, but we did not see much of Him
As we saw, the Lord Jesus said in Matthew 16 that He will build His church, but where is He building His church today?
These are good for the sake of fellowship, but there is little opportunity for the Lord to build up His church in these groups
In some Catholic churches we can find the 'charismatic' things, the mass, and the worship of Mary all mixed together
As we have seen, the book of Revelation is not merely a book of prophecy concerning the beasts and the ten horns
In chapter 1 there are the local churches, and in chapters 2 and 3 there is more concerning the local churches
Revelation begins with the seven churches and ends with the New Jerusalem, which is the consummation of the churches
We do not criticize the other works that some do, but we realize that the central testimony that the Lord desires is the local churches
The local churches are not a mission, work, denomination, or organization to maintain certain teachings and doctrines
On the last night that the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He gave His final message, a long speaking of three chapters, John 14 through 16
The church life is the glorification of the Son; for the Son to be glorified there is the need of a proper church life
Just as we know that there is electricity in a building by the shining of the lights we know that Jesus is here by His glowing in the saints
The term church is not there in black and white letters, but it is there in actuality, reality, and practicality
Just as electricity cannot be expressed without the shining of the lamps, the Son of God cannot be glorified without the church
If the Son is concealed, no one can know the Father, but when the Son is expressed, the Father is also expressed in the Son's expression
It is as if the Lord was praying, 'Glorify Your Son in the church so that the Son may glorify You in His glorification'
We all need to see that the Lord's prayer to the Father in John 17 is a prayer, practically speaking, for the church life
It was at this time that the Son began to be glorified in the church, and in the glorification of the Son the Father was also glorified
For the Son's glorification in the church life, there is the need for the genuine oneness of all the Son's believers
Some sisters also insisted on coming but we did not have the space for them because we had begun the Lords table in my mothers living room
At that time, the Baptists were for baptism by immersion, the Presbyterians were for sprinkling, and the two were fighting with each other
We are not decided on the right way to sit, call on the name of the Lord, or pray-read, or whether to shout or be silent
The genuine oneness is the oneness in the Triune Godthe Father in the Son and the Son in the Fatheraccording to Their divine life and nature
If we come together to discuss the rapture, the tribulation, foot-washing, or head covering, we may quickly be divided
In this way we will have the proper church life, the Son will be glorified, and the Father will be glorified in the Son's glorification
Some say it will be before the tribulation, some say after the tribulation, and some say during the tribulation
The proper Christian faith is first that the Bible is God's divine Word, divinely inspired by God, word by word
God the Son one day became flesh to be a man by the name of Jesus and lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years
All these believing persons, while they are on this earth, should come together to worship God in a corporate way as the church
Some have different opinions and doctrines about food; some eat only vegetables, but others feel that everything is good for eating
If anyone does not believe that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, he is not a Christian brother; he is in the principle of an antichrist
Our oneness is in the divine life and nature, not in anything else, and our oneness even is the divine life and nature
Jesus seemed to be saying, 'Father, You have given Me the life, the right, and the position to be Your Son in order to express You
We receive justification by faith, and we practice baptism and the presbytery, but we are not standing for any of these
In the New Jerusalem there will no longer be any murmuring, because at that time John 17:23 will be fully answered and fulfilled
We need to be one, we must have the one goal to express God the Father, and we must have the growth so that we may be perfected into one
We have the divine nature for our oneness, the glorious goal of our oneness, and growth unto maturity for the perfection of our oneness
Today we all have the divine nature within us, we have the one goal to glorify God, and we are all growing in life
To this end, we need the young people to fight the battle, just as a nation needs young soldiers for its defense
We thank God for the book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament and the concluding book of the entire Bible
As we saw in a previous chapter, Revelation is not merely a book of predictions of events that will transpire in the future
In portraying Christ, this revelation also gives us a full record of the church from the first century until the time of the coming kingdom
On the one hand, these teachers opened this book in a general way, but on the other hand, they also misinterpreted certain matters
The book of Revelation is a revelation not merely by Christ but concerning Christ in His church and in oneness with His church
Based upon this principle, it opens with the first three chapters depicting the situation of the church in a practical and full way
Most of them chose to go to the idol of the so-called 'holy mother' to burn their candle, worship the idol, and pray to it
Under one idol was a notice that to come to it and pray every day would reduce a loved one's time in purgatory
The Catholic Church is only gilded to deceive people with a good, divine appearance, but its contents are evil and abominable
Following this is chapter 21, which shows the New Jerusalem built with precious stones and pearls inlaid in the golden mountain
As the revelation concerning Christ, the book of Revelation presents the testimony of Jesus, which is the church
The Lord Jesus likened this age to the age of Noah, saying, 'Just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be
We will see that on the whole earth the age is full of evil matters such as fornication adultery sodomy dancing clubs robbery and violence
The Islamic holy book, the Koran, is merely a counterfeit of the Old Testament with a little of the New Testament
In the same way, apparently the synagogues of the Jewish religion are for the worship of God, but in actuality Satan is there
At the entrance to a cathedral in Manila is a statue of Mary, one of whose hands is almost completely worn out
Catholicism teaches people something about Jesus and they teach people to worship God but their teachings are for the most part misleading
Because of this, some of the priests asked the pope to allow Chinese Catholics to continue this kind of worship
Before that day, people may rob from one another, but on the day of repentance they would repent of what they did
Verse 14 mentions the teaching of Balaam, which is to teach God's people to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication
As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant church, from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ
Even though certain matters were restored by this church, these things were about to die; hence, they needed to be revived
Should we be in the unbelieving world, going to movies, skiing, dancing, surfing, and gambling in the casinos in Reno and Las Vegas?
The name of God is in Judaism, the name of Christ is in Catholicism, and the name of Jesus is in Protestantism
The wrong concept about overcoming is that we need to overcome the small things, such as bad habits, our temper, smoking, or drinking
Every religion today is a 'drug,' a deceit, but the book of Revelation shows a clear, pure, bright, and shining way
We must be clear, honest, and faithful; otherwise, we will be fully befuddled and judged by the Lord with this generation
Today there are millions of genuine Christians here, saved, washed with the blood, and regenerated in their spirit
We fully believe that our God is working strongly on this earth to attract a remnant of His lovers and seekers
Some may think that if the Lord's recovery is of God, we will have a great movement and gain a large number of people
In the ancient time, Noah preached righteousness for one hundred twenty years, but he gained only eight persons, including himself
No doubt Noah had many relatives, but only his wife, three sons, and three daughters-in-law entered with him into the ark
The Lord Jesus worked for three and a half years with many kinds of miracles, but eventually He gained only one hundred twenty persons
People today like to trust in miracles, but the Lord Jesus even raised people from the dead, and still only a few believed
It is a shame for someone to be in the Lord's recovery yet still go to movies and bear the signs of modern fashions
The people in the Lord's recovery should be the reserved ones, fully separated from this crooked, perverse, and condemned generation
The whole world is under Satan, yet this man had nothing to do with Satan, and Satan could do nothing with Him
When the church people walk on the street, not only the angels but even the worldly people can discern that we are a separated people
There are no regulations posted on the wall concerning the way the brothers should cut their hair or the way the sisters should dress
The first gift in 1 Corinthians 12 is the word of wisdom, not speaking in tongues, and the second gift is the word of knowledge
As the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness for forty years, they saw the greatest miracle every morning
These people will be today's Noah, who terminate the present generation and usher in the coming age, the age of the kingdom
What we are building in the church life is today's ark for our salvation and for the salvation of the ones under our care
According to the revelation of the Gospels, the Lord Jesus was born not into a Gentile world but into a religious world
One was those who were in the Jewish religion but followed Him out of the fold the camp such as Peter John James and many other young ones
The old prophetess Anna was also for the Lord Jesus, but she probably did not follow the Lord to leave the temple
Although Peter may have been the oldest of the first disciples, he still may have been a few years younger than the Lord
Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, two older disciples, took care of the Lord's body and buried Him in a new tomb
Nicodemus and Joseph may have been members of Christ, but we must not consider the church in a merely doctrinal way
Peter said, 'By no means, Lord,' but the Lord was patient with him until he finally saw the vision concerning Cornelius's household
70, the Lord sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy the holy city and the holy temple, leaving no stone upon another
The Jewish religion was the crooked generation from which those Jews needed to be saved on the day of Pentecost
The proper meaning of these verses is that on the cross the Jewish religion was crucified to Paul, and Paul was crucified to it
In addition to bad temper, high blood pressure and heart problems are also made worse by eating too many sweets
They have changed the appetites of the believers until even the real believers care to eat only 'candy' and have no appetite for solid food
Anyone who comes to minister solid food offends them, because they have no capacity to digest and assimilate it
Rather, He came to people with God's purpose, telling them not only of God's salvation but also of God's way to fulfill His purpose
The world that hated the Lord Jesus was not the Gentile world, the secular world, but the Jewish, religious world
Religion is a system that teaches people to worship God and behave in a good way in order to please God, apart from Christ
While teaching people to worship God and to behave in order to please God, religion keeps people away from the real experience of Christ
God's intention is to work Christ into all of us that we may be the partners of Christ to fulfill God's eternal purpose
We need to jump out of the snare of every religion: the Jewish religion, the Catholic religion, and the Protestant religion
No doubt, we have come out of religion, but has the religious element been radically, fully, and thoroughly eradicated from our being?
Because Gods operation motivates us within we simply cooperate with Him to work out the salvation that saves us from the present generation
We need this kind of salvation, one built not by God directly but by our daily cooperation with His inward operation
The proper consideration is what the Lord's way is to fulfill His purpose, terminate the present age, and usher in His kingdom
Without the New Jerusalem we would have no home in the new heaven and new earth, no city or building where we can meet with the Lord
To some extent, Revelation contains teachings and prophecies, but it is not merely a book of teachings and prophecies
Among Christian teachers and Bible students there is much dispute about the small phrase the revelation of Jesus Christ in 1:1
If a person has a veil over him, we will not be able to see him, and the more we try to study him, the more we will not accurately know him
Others may see that the seven lampstands are the seven churches, but they do not know why the churches are signified by lampstands
In the book of Revelation we should see only one figure, Jesus Christ, because this book is the revelation and unveiling of Jesus Christ
We may have a painting of a lion, but in order to bring out the figure of the lion, we need a background and an environment
It is difficult to tell where she is because she is clothed with the sun the moon is underneath her feet and a crown of stars is on her head
In Revelation 5 the angel introduced Him as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, but when John turned to see Him, he saw a Lamb
He died on the cross as the Lamb of God to redeem us, but even after being redeemed, we are still mixed with many negative things
When used as nouns, testimony and witness can refer either to the thing testified or to the person who gives the testimony
There is a man in this universe, who was even on the earth, by the name of Jesus, who was and still is the testimony of God
Revelation 1:1 and 2 reveal that this book is not only the revelation of Christ but also a record of the testimony of Jesus
Immediately after this John received the vision of the seven lampstands the local churches with the wonderful Christ walking in their midst
Sometimes even owning a car changes a brother, and an item of modern fashion from the department store changes a sister
On the one hand, our spouse and children are like fire to burn us, but on the other hand, they are like dampening water to cause us to rust
Now we can see why the testimony of God is a golden lampstand, and the testimony of Jesus today is the golden lampstands
Those who have not seen that whether we are right or wrong makes no difference will always vindicate and fight
Today many Christians consider that as long as they are spiritual, holy, and for the Lord, everything is all right
If there is no proper church where we are, we should spend every penny and even our own being to be in a place where there is a church
To say that the goal of our salvation is for us to go to heaven is according to a shallow concept of the New Testament
Because Adam failed God in this respect, Jesus came as the second man to take the position and function of Adam
According to the book of Revelation, God on His throne has the appearance of jasper, and the New Jerusalem also has the appearance of jasper
In the New Testament there are also three unique things: one Christ, one church, and one holy city, the New Jerusalem
Upon this site is a building, and at various corners of it are sections belonging to different major denominations
God desires an expression in this universe, and wherever this expression is, in each locality, it must be uniquely one
Almost all Christians today would say that they are for the word of God, but very few will say that they are for the testimony of Jesus
Immediately after John declared this, he saw a vision of the seven lampstands, signifying the seven local churches
The central concept of the first three chapters of Revelation is the seven lampstands as the seven local churches to be God's expression
According to most of the teachings in Christianity, the church is simply the gathering of the many saved ones who are ready to go to heaven
A number of years ago in Taiwan certain leading ones in Christianity rebuked me saying You should not say that todays Christianity is fallen
If we were the testimony of Jesus, we would not be able to be worldly, and we would not be able to argue much with our husband or wife
If he loves all of the saints and behaves himself in a humble, nice, and kind way, we may consider him to be a good brother
As long as we are in the golden lampstands, we surely are saved, and it is here also that we become holy, spiritual, heavenly, and divine
To be a part of the testimony of Jesus costs us our everything, but in actuality all that we are and have are nothing
In this same principle, the cathedrals, chapels, and sanctuaries of Christianity today are also not truly something of God
In the fourth church, the church in Thyatira, there is the woman Jezebel , signifying the Roman Catholic Church
Verse 20 says that Jezebel teaches and leads the Lord's slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices
We must all realize that on the earth today there are four negative items: Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and worldliness
Such a person needs to take the word that Peter spoke on the day of Pentecost, 'Be saved from this crooked generation'
According to the context of Acts 2, it was the Jewish religion with its leaders, priests, and elders that crucified the Lord Jesus
The evil age in the United States is composed of four elements: worldliness, Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism
When Peter stood on the day of Pentecost, the crooked generation was the Jewish religion, and the testimony of Jesus was the church
Today the crooked generation is modern worldliness plus Judaism Catholicism and Protestantism and the testimony of Jesus is still the church
If the recovery of the churches is something of the Lord in His governmental way, we must be careful about touching it
We must be saved from today's crooked and perverse generation-from modern worldliness and from Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism
Man failed God in this matter, but the Lord Jesus came as the second man , who was successful in expressing God
Now Jesus as the unique lampstand is spreading Himself, branching out, as signified by the six branches of the lampstand
The water of the flood executed God's judgment upon the entire world, and it also separated Noah from the crooked and perverted generation
Not long after that, however, Noah's descendants were divided into the nations, from which Babel was raised up
Noah was saved through water out of his generation, and Israel was also saved out of Egypt through the water of the Red Sea
One day this God, who was Jesus Himself, went into a small house at Bethany to talk with Mary and Lazarus and be served by Martha
They stirred up the people to shout, 'Crucify Him' , and in this way they killed the very Savior who was their God
The gospel he preached was, 'Be saved from this crooked generation' , which was the Jewish religion that had killed Jesus
All these saved ones remained together loving one another and they became the church the testimony of Jesus against the crooked generation
Eventually, out of the church as the testimony of Jesus, Satan created Catholicism, another crooked and perverted generation
Today people often ask what kind of Christians we are whether we are Catholic Episcopalian Presbyterian Methodist Lutheran or something else
We are standing here as the testimony of Jesus against this present crooked and perverted generation composed of these four items
Based on the history of Christianity, some may be concerned that one day even the local churches will be corrupted by Satan
In the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 we can see worldliness , Judaism , Catholicism , and Protestantism
We are no longer under the Jewish rituals, the Catholic ordinances, the Protestant practices, or the influence of the Christian free groups
The reason we are so much for Christ as the Spirit is that in order to experience Him, we must realize who He is and where He is
Many in Christianity simply fight, oppose, and argue according to their traditional teachings without knowing the experience of Christ
We only know to eat Jesus, and we have the assurance that the way to eat Jesus is to call on Him, saying, 'O Lord Jesus, Amen, Hallelujah'!
If we are the overcomers who eat Jesus, we will be transformed into white stones, and we will be built into the temple
We may be on the line of the bright woman, but some of the old traditions of the old religion may still remain in us
David's wife despised him for that, but her condemnation of him caused her to lose her fruitfulness and be barren
Today we rejoice before the Lord, proclaiming that He is good for food as the tree of life and the hidden manna
Today we may be silent, but tomorrow we may come together as the living testimony of Jesus to shout, 'Hallelujah, praise the Lord, Amen'!
Some Christians may say one thing to people's face, another thing behind their back, and yet something else on another occasion
When many of us were in the denominations, everything was opaque to us, but when we came into the church, we came into a clear sky
The Bible records that all the saved ones throughout the ages were not only for their salvation but for God's testimony
The thought that man is made to worship, serve, and work for God and behave himself for His glory comes from fallen, degraded religion
When someone takes a photograph of a person, he has no intention for the photograph to worship him or work for him
If a photograph would say to the one who took it, 'I want to worship you,' the person would reply, 'How foolish
In the first two chapters of Genesis there is nothing that says we must work for God, worship God, and serve Him
God has the heavens for His throne, the earth for His footstool, and millions of angels to serve Him, work for Him, and worship Him
The poor thought of Christianity is too selfish, only considering people's own salvation, welfare, peace, and joy
A good mother would never allow her children to eat too much candy and dessert instead of proper, nourishing food
As we have pointed out, Noah was saved not only from God's judgment but also from the crooked, perverted, and evil generation
One of his daughters-in-law might have said, 'I prefer my old house with many bedrooms, bathrooms, and a large living room
It was a salvation not merely from eternal perdition but out of the crooked, evil generation and into a new age
Genesis 9:1 says, 'God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth'
Because man was made in God's image, for Noah and his sons to multiply was for them to be a multiplied expression of God
We can be assured that besides Noah and his family, there must have been a number of others who believed in God
On the other hand, though, we may still go to the department stores to buy the things of the modern, worldly fashions
If we cooperate with God's operation, on the negative side, we will spontaneously be rescued out of this crooked generation
Many at Noah's time may have been saved from eternal perdition, but only eight were rescued from their generation and put into the ark
In the Catholic Church today there is the charismatic movement, and many people there like to read Watchman Nee's books'
He wants to save us from the crooked generation and usher us into God's kingdom to fulfill His eternal purpose
The book of Revelation contains the highest salvation, which is the golden lampstands, today's ark, the churches
Some people question us as to what we mean when we speak of the church, asking, 'Do you mean that only you are the church'?
The Lord appeared after His resurrection to five hundred brothers at one time, but only one hundred twenty were in the practical church life
You do not like for us to call ourselves what we are, but if we do not call ourselves the church, what should we call ourselves?
No church should say, 'Since we are the local church in our city, we want nothing to do with the other churches'
Whoever cuts themselves off from the fellowship with all the churches universally is no longer a local church; they have become a local sect
Some have used the messages of my ministry from our tapes and our books, yet they have openly rejected this ministry
To act in this way is not to be the pure woman clothed with the sun, with the moon underneath her feet, and a crown of stars on her head
It was through this ministry that the Lord's recovery was brought to this country, and many have received help from it
Regrettably, though, some have utilized the materials of this ministry to establish a church in their own 'pocket'
They might have been good one or two centuries ago, or even fifty years ago, but they are not good for the present revelation
In the entire universe there is only one flow, but whether anyone follows the messages from this flow is up to him
After the day of Pentecost the one flow flowed from Jerusalem to Antioch, and from Antioch the flow turned to Europe
Since Barnabas had brought Paul into the Lord's ministry, he may have thought that he could dissent against him
He will raise up only one trumpeter to sound one calling, one voice, so that His people on the earth can march on
The shining of the golden lampstands is so that people may see Christ as the Son of Man walking in their midst
The present age is the 'nighttime,' and in every corner and avenue of human society there is nothing but darkness
When people see Christ in the churches, they can realize that the churches are not low, mean, earthly, sinful, or mixed
Ephesus lost her first love , Pergamos is worldly , Thyatira is demonic , and Laodicea is lukewarm ; all these are negative matters
Because the world always afflicts the church , wherever the church is, there will always be a certain amount of persecution
There is no need for the woman to shine in the darkness, as the lampstands do, because she is always fully in the light
When we come to the lampstands, we are under the shining, and when we come to the woman, we are under the sun, the moon, and the stars
With her there is nothing earthly, such as casinos, department stores, television, sports, synagogues, cathedrals, or chapels
Some gatherings of Christians can be compared to a dark cell deep in the earth, having no openings for the light and being full of dirt
The best way to defeat Satan in the local churches is to minister the heavenly things to the saints so that the church may remain heavenly
Many times the love that some of the saints have is a fleshly love, not the love in the spirit that is as clear as crystal
Although Jesus has defeated Satan on the cross, there is still the need for the church to execute His victory over the enemy
We must realize that God has a need for us to be raptured; we must be raptured to heaven to fight against the enemy
If anyone does not go to heaven to meet Satan and cast him down, Satan will come down to the earth to meet and overcome him
Another young brother with his wife were among us, continually enjoying the Lord, but for over a year he also had a beard
If we do not see the young people in the church growing, this indicates that the church in our locality is not fertile soil
It will certainly be hard for such a man to break all these ties, but on the day he is buried, he will finally come out of the world
Eventually, outside the New Jerusalem there will be the lake of fire where all the things we buried in our baptism will go
We need to let the dirt, the world, and all the negative things pass through that entrance and go into the lake of fire
If we feel that we still have some earthly dirt, we should go to the baptistery and 'mail' it to the lake of fire
The sixth aspect is in chapter 19, where we see the bride prepared for a wedding by being clothed with fine linen, bright and clean
Those who do not express Christ as the fine linen will not be ready, and they will have no share in the wedding feast
They are saved, but because they have no share in expressing Christ, they will also have no share in that wedding day
The false Christ will be so bold as to fight against the true Christ, but the true Christ will war against the false one
When we look at the bride, we see fine linen as the expression of Christ, and when we look at the holy city, we see jasper
Besides this, Revelation also shows another woman, the great harlot, Babylon, that is full of abominations and fornication
Babylon signifies religion plus the world, the present generation, with its politics, diplomacy, and worldly affairs
Opposite to the church there is religionincluding Judaism Catholicism and Protestantismand the world with its politics and worldly affairs
We were on the other shore, but we have been baptized onto this shore; we were in Egypt, but we have been baptized through the Red Sea
The first ten chapters of Genesis require more than thirty messages of the Life-study of Genesis to cover them
The One sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper and the New Jerusalem with man as a component also has the appearance of jasper
The building with which the entire Bible concludes is a building with the divine life, and the purpose of the building is to express God
On the one hand, it is a book of prophecy, but to say this with the proper understanding requires us to know what prophecy is
Among the Christian teachers, there are different schools concerning the meaning of this one phrase the revelation of Jesus Christ
We may have seen Christ in the four Gospels, the Acts, and all the Epistles, but Christ is much more even than this
Regrettably, most Christians only know Christ mainly from the Gospels and a little from the Acts and the Epistles
Luke 4:22 says that words of grace proceeded out of His mouth, but Revelation tells us that a two-edged sword proceeds out of His mouth
In John 1:29 He is introduced as the Lamb of God, but in Revelation 5:5 He is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah
In this sense, Revelation continues the Gospels and the Epistles, but it does not reveal Christ according to the Gospels and the Epistles
We, the believers, must behave ourselves, love our neighbor, honor our parents, love our wife, and submit to our husband
In the midst of the four living creatures is One who was introduced as the Lion, but when John looked, the Lion became a Lamb
The third vision is of four horses running a race , a white horse, a red horse, a black horse, and a pale horse
In chapter 12 there is a wonderful woman clothed with the sun, with the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars
In chapter 19 there is a clean, neat, bright, white, and pure bride , clothed in fine linen, with whom there is no mixture, dirt, or spot
In chapter 20 there is the ancient serpent , and in chapters 21 and 22 there is the holy city, the New Jerusalem
We must turn our eyes away from the frogs, the beasts, the locusts, the dragon, and the serpent and turn our eyes upon this Lion
Many failed God in this very respect, but Psalm 8 tells us that a second man would come to resume the responsibility of man to express God
Now the church is the new man, which is created in Christ according to the image of God, having Christ as God's expression
In the seven epistles that the Lord spoke to the seven churches, we can find some secrets of how we can be the expression of God
It is difficult to describe this wonderful person, but we know that in this universe there is such a wonderful One
These chapters first present a vision of Christ as the Son of Man walking in the midst of the seven lampstands, the local churches
Some Christian teachers say that since the lampstands must be in heaven, Jesus is walking among them in heaven
He was writing to seven cities on the earth-Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea
Verse 12 of Revelation 3 indicates that the stones are built into the temple as a main part, a supporting pillar, of God's building
We are being built into the church, which today is the temple and in the future will be enlarged to be the city
The tree of life, the manna, and the produce of the good land are all types of the various aspects of Christ as food to us
In one sense the church is still humanity but in another sense it is a stone a solid supporting pillar and a pure solid golden lampstand
The Lord Jesus indicated that although the synagogues apparently were something for God, in actuality they had all become something of Satan
If the churches in the Lord's recovery in the United States become bright, eventually even Judaism will rise up against them
In the parable in Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus said that this woman, Jezebel, took leaven and hid it in three measures of fine flour
The Lord told the church in Laodicea that it is neither cold nor hot, and because of this He is about to spew it out of His mouth
The Lords intention here is to show us the things that are versus the church His testimonyJudaism Catholicism Protestantism and the world
Within Catholicism and Protestantism there are the subordinate items, such as the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans
In the previous chapter we saw that Judaism is satanic Catholicism is demonic Protestantism is dead and Christless and the world is devilish
Jezebel was an evil woman in the Old Testament during the time of the kings, but now the church in Thyatira tolerates that evil woman
According to church history again, Sardis signifies the Protestant church, which in the eyes of the Lord is dead and lifeless
By the Lord's simple and clear word, we can see the real situation in the typical religions, even in the so-called Christian churches

As we have seen, the testimony of Jesus is the church as the expression, testimony, and revelation of Jesus in a corporate way
In order to see Jesus, we must see Him in the church, because Jesus is expressed and revealed in the proper church life
As we have also seen, because the book of Revelation unveils Christ, in this sense it also is the testimony of Jesus
Because of the wrong concept in Christianity, most Christians consider that Revelation is too difficult for anyone to understand
The great multitude of the redeemed in chapter 7 serve God in the heavenly temple and enjoy God's care and the Lamb's shepherding
The overcomers on the glassy sea in Revelation 15 are those who overcome the beast and all the negative things
The other chapters simply speak of horses, locusts, scorpions, frogs, beasts, a dragon, a serpent, and a great harlot

The church is the shining lampstand, but in some places the church eventually becomes like this wonderful woman
The church is a wonderful 'woman' in our locality who will deliver a man-child to bring in the kingdom age and rule over all the nations
In this aspect, the church is not merely a lampstand, a light bearer; it is clothed with the universal light bearers
Only a wonderful woman in light can deliver the man-child who will cast Satan down from the heavens to the earth
Eventually, the kingdom, the authority, of Christ will be ushered in by the man-child delivered by this bright woman
A person can sit in the pews of certain denominations for many years, but year after year he will remain the same

The church in the millennium will be the bride, and the entire thousand years will be the wedding day with the wedding feast

God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the church
