   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S FULL SALVATION CONSISTING OF TWO GREAT ELEMENTS REDEMPTION AND SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After God created man, He wanted man to take in the tree of life; that is, He wanted man to receive God Himself into him to be his life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, in the universe besides God there is another one, who in the Bible is called the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before man ate of the tree of life and would thereby receive God, the devil seduced man to eat of another tree and receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The devil is symbolized by the other special tree in the Garden of Eden, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When man ate of that other tree, the devil entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before God could enter into man, the devil entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once the devil entered into man, the evil nature of the devil was mingled with the nature of man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are two schools of thought among the Chinese sages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One school says that man is evil by nature, and the other school maintains that man is good by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is man's nature good or evil?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both schools have their bases.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The man whom God created originally was considered by God as very good because man was created in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is love, God is light, God is holiness, and God is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, according to these divine attributes, God created man also to be love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Within us, we prefer light to darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, we have love; we love our parents, we love our relatives, we love our neighbors, we love our schoolmates, and we love others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are also holy; we do not like to drift with the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, we like to be righteous and just.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have these characteristics within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we have discovered that we also have the evil nature in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are we good or evil?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the Holy Scriptures, we are good with regard to God's creation, but with regard to the devil's corruption we are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, fallen man is quite complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have the devil and sin within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sin within us is also called "the evil" Rom 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Romans 7 Paul said that sin dwells in us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because it can dwell in us, we know that sin is not dead but living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what the apostle Paul called "the evil."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only so, man has transgressions outwardly, so he is a transgressor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, inwardly we are sinners, and outwardly we are transgressors.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are sinners within and transgressors without.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a sinner within, we have greed, lust, and other wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a transgressor without, we lie, cheat, steal, and do whatever evil things we like to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The older one becomes, the more shrewd and cunning he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An older person becomes shrewd within and cunning without.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When a person gets older, the sin within him also becomes older; hence, he becomes an experienced sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a man gets older, he becomes older in his outward transgressions and thus becomes an experienced transgressor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A. God's Redemption, with the Precious Blood of Christ as the Focus, Meeting the Need in the Judicial Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since man became so corrupt, did God then abandon him?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No, God so loved man that He would not give him up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, God has His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God could not allow Himself to be so easily defeated by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, He brought in redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Redemption was added because man became fallen and was corrupted and thereby became a sinner and a transgressor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to use man again as His vessel, God had to thoroughly deal with his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God had to rescue man, cleanse man, and make man complete again before He could dwell in him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to His righteous law, God was obligated to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Also according to common logic, God had to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God had to first carry out redemption for man before He could use him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, there are two elements in God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First, God came to redeem; second, He came to save.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Redemption was to meet the need in the judicial aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Suppose God ignored the fact that man had been corrupted and still used man for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then the angels and the devil would shake their heads and say, "You are a God of righteousness, light, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How can You use such a dirty, base, corrupted, evil, and filthy man?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not right judicially."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, God's redemption, with the precious blood of Christ as its focus, was necessary in order to meet the need of the judicial aspect Rom 3:20-26; Eph 1:7 .</S>
