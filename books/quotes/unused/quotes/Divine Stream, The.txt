God's intention is to be life to man, for it is as life to man and the life of man that God could be the supply to all of man's need
In the beginning of Genesis we see that after man was created he was placed in the Garden of Eden beside a tree called the tree of life
By the help of further revelations of the Scripture, we understand that this is a picture which shows how God comes to man
The Lord can give us the living water, and the water He gives shall become in us a well of water, springing up unto eternal life
By this we know that the Holy Spirit is the second channel by which God Himself flows out as the living water to us
It means that the life of God flows out of God Himself in the redeeming Savior, the Lamb, with ruling authority to be life to us now
We also see that it has the power to produce, for where it goes vegetable life as well as animal life is produced
It flows throughout the entire city, and the whole city can only have fellowship through or by this stream of living water
Consider again the situation of the New Jerusalem and suppose that you are one who is coming into the city from the outside
When you enter the gate, you immediately come upon the one street of the city in which is flowing the stream of living water
In other words, this stream of living water will cause you to know something of Christ; it will testify to you something of Christ
Is the channel; here is the way; here is the means by which you can touch Christ, by which you can experience Christ
On the day of Pentecost this stream of divine life flowed out of God Himself in Christ with ruling power from the throne
Is a picture of the flowing of the stream of divine life, and with the flowing of this stream is the work of God
There are twenty-eight chapters, but in the book of Acts in heaven today there may be twenty-eight hundred chapters
It is the stream of life, the stream of fellowship, the stream of testimony, and the stream of the work of God
In the universe there is a divine stream which starts in the beginning of the Scriptures and flows throughout the whole Book
The entire Scripture is concerned with this one basic and central matter, that of God mingling Himself with us
He comes into us to be our life just as a stream of water flowing out and flowing in, flowing out from heaven and flowing into us
There we see a city made of gold, pearls, and precious stones, the same kind of materials listed in Genesis chapter two
The Lord Jesus tells us that the water that He gives will become a fountain of living water springing up unto eternal life
All these words relate to one thing that God has flowed out and is still flowing on this earth into humanity as the life
Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit he hath poured forth this
He is the One Who died to redeem us from our sins and Who has been exalted to the highest place in the universe
As the Lamb slain, the crucified Jesus has now been exalted to the throne to have the full authority of the universe
Christ, the Lamb, with God within Him is sitting on the throne, and from this very throne flows out the river of divine life
From the throne where Christ is sitting, there flows out a stream of water, the contents of which can never be exhausted
The fact that this tree grows in the living water shows us that Christ as life is in the flowing of the Holy Spirit
They have the life of the Triune God within them, but they are not keeping themselves in the flowing of this life
Whenever you feel that the flowing of the stream within you is cut off, you must turn to the Lord immediately to seek the reason
Eventually, however, he became clear that the flowing was striking forth from Asia to Europe, and he had to go along with it
History tells us that from Europe it flowed to the West, to America; and from the West it flowed to the East and to the South
If you will accept the mercy and the grace of the Lord, you will be brought into that very stream that is flowing today
In just such a way is the stream of the Holy Spirit as the fellowship of the Body flowing among the saints upon this earth
It started from the throne of the exalted Lamb and has been flowing through all generations to this present time
He said, 'Brother, do you know that we can never go to any place to start a work unless the current of the Holy Spirit is there already'?
Brother Nee continued to say: 'Oh, brother, if you realize where the current of the Holy Spirit is, simply go along with it!
What we must do today is just go along with the stream, just subject ourselves to the current of the work of the Holy Spirit
Not where we elect to go, But where Jesus leads the way; There the living waters flow, There our darkness turns to day
In Revelation we are told that the entire city, the New Jerusalem, is built with gold, with pearls, and with precious stones
Where the stream of the divine life is, there some material, some precious material, for the building of the church will come into being
May He always keep us in the flowing of the life, in the fellowship, in the testimony, in the work, and in the building of the house of God
