   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Human Opinions</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the problem of the Jewish religion was resolved, Paul and Barnabas immediately went out to the Gentile lands to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The problem of outward religion had been solved, but now they encountered an inward, subjective problem Barnabas and Paul could not be in one accord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>35-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Barnabas wanted to take Mark to visit the brothers, but Paul felt it was not suitable, and an argument arose between them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their argument was the work of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spread of the church was greatly damaged because Barnabas and Paul could not be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This pattern has been repeated many times in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the church spreads, it first meets outward difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the evil plot of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The spread of the church is the building up of the Body of Christ; if the church does not spread, the Body of Christ cannot be built up and God s eternal plan cannot be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The record in Acts shows that Satan follows the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Holy Spirit works to spread and build up the church, Satan follows to damage the Spirit s work of spreading and building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Satan first raises up opposition to the gospel, and then he raises up opposition to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, the Gentiles received the gospel, and churches were established in Gentile lands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Next, Satan instigated some from Jerusalem to bring Jewish thought, law, circumcision, and ordinances into the churches in Gentile lands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Despite Satan s attack, the Holy Spirit continued to work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When religious ordinances were limiting the spread of the church, God first sent Paul to Jerusalem and won a victory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, He raised up an army to destroy Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not long after this outward problem was resolved, there was a difference of opinion between Barnabas and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When brothers who are co-workers have a difference of opinion, the spread of the church is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is difficult to say who was right in the contention between Barnabas and Paul, but from that time forth Acts does not record anything regarding Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that the responsibility for the error was mainly with Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless, we should be warned both of problems within and of problems in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan works in our environment to damage the spread of the church, and he also works among us to damage the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The contention between Paul and Barnabas weakened the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These two apostles, who had been working together, were now separated; Barnabas took Mark and went west to Cyprus, and Paul took Silas and went north to Syria and Cilicia vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>39-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must read this portion of the Bible very carefully in order to discover the thought of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul wanted to stay in Asia Minor where he had labored previously, but the Holy Spirit forbade him to remain there 16:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul considered going to Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them v. 7 . For the sake of the spread of the church, the Holy Spirit gave Paul a vision calling him to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Paul saw the vision, he crossed the sea from Asia Minor to Macedonia vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the church spread from Asia Minor to Europe and turned south to the cities of Athens and Corinth 17:15; 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Old Concepts Paul s Old Concepts in His Second Journey</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Acts 16:6-12 indicates that even Paul had problems within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit wanted him to go out to spread the church, but he did not understand the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As he vacillated between going forward or going back, a dream came to him in the night telling him to go to Macedonia in Europe vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This illustrates a common problem among the Lord s workers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once workers come to a place for a time and settle down, they do not want to move.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At times like these, unwanted circumstances always happen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, if I were in charge of my movement, I am afraid I would still be in northern China today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, God s hand moved me step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Old relationships, old affections, and old inclinations keep us from going to another place; they make us unable to move.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is because we do not have any vision.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a worker goes to a place, he tends to become set and settled.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not an easy problem to solve.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the end of Acts 15 there is the problem between Barnabas and Paul; in Acts 16 there is a problem within Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The spread of the church encounters difficulties at each step.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If Paul had not been subdued by the Holy Spirit, the church could not have spread to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot merely read the black and white words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we read Acts 15 through 17, we must look to the Lord for light to see how the church spread.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For the church to spread, the bondage of the Jewish religion, human opinions, and the self with its old concepts must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The spread of the church often encounters these three problems.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first problem is outward, the second is between the workers, and the third comes from the self and old human feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church should have spread to Europe much sooner, but these problems delayed its spread.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The final problem in the spread of the church is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we stay in our old feelings and relationships, the spread of the church will be delayed indefinitely.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To break out of the self, we need a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we break through, the church spreads.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is true even today.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Dead ordinances, human opinions, and the old feelings of the self stop the Holy Spirit from breaking through and restrict the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the Holy Spirit breaks through these three problems, the church will spread.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the early days, the church spread to Europe and gained a foothold there because the Holy Spirit broke through in these three areas.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Holy Spirit broke through religious regulations and ceremonies, and He broke through dead letters, human opinions, and human feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must look to the Lord for light so that He would have a way in us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then He will give us ample opportunity to spread His church to distant lands.</S>
