[1]  The key to the understanding of the Bible and of God is the person of Jesus Christ.
[2]  No other person in history has affected mankind as much as Jesus Christ has.
[3]  Then Jesus proceeded to ask them a most pointed question, a question which we all must answer: "But you, who do you say that I am?" v. 15 . Only one of Jesus' disciples, Peter, answered by saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . By saying that Jesus was the Son of the living God, Peter was saying that Christ was God Himself John 10:30, 33; 5:18; 1:1; 20:28; 1 John 5:20; Phil 2:6; Heb 1:8 . The Lord responded to Peter by saying, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" v. 17 . We need heavenly revelation to receive the blessing of seeing who Christ really is.
[4]  CHRIST'S BIRTH THROUGH THE CONCEPTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND BY A VIRGIN PROVING THAT HE IS GOD
[5]  There are many proofs to show that Christ is God.
[6]  When He lived on the earth, Jesus was always conscious of the fact that He was God.
[7]  When Jesus said, "Before Abraham came into being, I am," the Jews picked up stones to throw at Him because they knew He was saying that He was God.
[8]  More amazing than the miracles Christ performed are the words that He spoke.
[9]  CHRIST'S AUTHORITY TO FORGIVE SINS PROVING THAT HE IS GOD
[10]  Not only was Christ sinless in Himself, but He was also able to forgive others' sins.
[11]  The scribes were indignant at His word because they realized that only God could forgive man's sins, and for Jesus to forgive sins meant that He claimed to be God.
[12]  The most wonderful thing about Christ is not only the way He died, but that He did not remain in death.
