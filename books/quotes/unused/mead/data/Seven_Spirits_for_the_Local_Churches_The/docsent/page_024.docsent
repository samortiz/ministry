   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LORD S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus in Revelation 3 told the church in Laodicea that they were lukewarm, neither cold nor hot; so He must spew them out.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lukewarmness does not suit the Lord s taste.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are cold, just be cold; if you are hot, be hot.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if you are lukewarm, the Lord will spew you out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It means that you have nothing to do with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not only a matter of being saved or of being lost.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must take care of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Are you enjoying Christ, and are you enjoyable to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all must enjoy Christ, and we all must be enjoyable to Him in order to have the life fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We simply need to enjoy His sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today s Christianity always has teaching, teaching, teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We came out of a background of religious teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today s Christianity is altogether a religion of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord has no intention of giving a religion to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord did speak to the Jewish people, and it was put into writings, comprising the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Jewish people made a religion out of these books.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They only care for doctrines and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some years ago, I met a Hebrew believer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both he and his wife told me how they were orthodox Jews before they became believers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Jewish religion had so many regulations, even how to wear your shoes and in what direction to place your shoes at night.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every regulation was based upon a verse of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They could tell you why they had to put their shoes in a certain direction by referring to a verse in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Would you laugh at them?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you would laugh at them, you must laugh at yourself first.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord had no intention of giving the Jewish people a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His intention was to give them the living Word that they might gain and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But they made a dead religion of the Word, causing the Word to be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They had the knowledge of the Bible without a living contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So when the Lord Jesus came, they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE LIVING STAR</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord Jesus was born, the magi came from the heathen world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They did not have the Bible, and they did not have the knowledge of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They did not have religion, yet they saw the star.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>King Herod called the leaders of the Jewish people to ask them where Christ should be born.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Immediately, they told Herod that He should be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They had the knowledge, but they did not go to Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the magi, who did not have knowledge, went there and found Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I was young, I was taught that as long as we have the Bible, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But later I discovered that this is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here is the proof: The magi were told by the people who had the Bible that Christ was to be born in Bethlehem, and they went to Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But still they had a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible tells us He was to be born in Bethlehem, but it does not say on what street, in what house, and at what address.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord, when the Bible was lacking, the living star came.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The living star was above, and the magi were walking beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was the star that led them to the very place where the Lord Jesus was born Matt 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the Bible were everything, there would be no need for the Lord to be the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Bible may tell us the principles, but the details must come from the inner anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would say that it was not the Bible that eventually led the magi to Christ, but the living star.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do believe in the Bible, and I do love this book.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the Bible is without, and the Holy Spirit is within.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These are the two great gifts that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Holy Bible must be one with the Holy Spirit; then it becomes living.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without the Holy Spirit, the Bible is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without the Holy Spirit, the Bible is just the dead letters that kill.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible should not be the word of knowledge in letters, but the word of life in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible must be a book of life in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christianity has even made so many different kinds of religions out of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some take verses about immersion and develop a religion out of immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Others take verses about the presbytery eldership and make a religion out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some take verses about speaking in tongues and make a tongue-speaking religion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some take a passage about head covering and make a head-covering religion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then some argue that you should not cover your head, so they make a non-head-covering religion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some insist to cover the head with a black head covering, and others with a white head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>So there are two kinds of religion for head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even more than this, some have a short covering, and others have a long covering.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some take verses about foot-washing and make a foot-washing religion out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All these religions have come out of Christianity s doctrinal use of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But none of them is right.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I do believe that the Lord is going to tear down all these religions.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>SELF-MADE RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not have a self-made religion.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We all have a kind of self-made religion.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some like to be silent, some like to be loud, some like to do this, and some like to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some say that Los Angeles is too noisy, and they do not like it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They prefer silence.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But this is just their self-made religion.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They do not like it, but the Lord honors it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What can they say?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is something quite peculiar which exists in China.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Some Christians shake their chairs whenever they meet.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I am not for it, but I have discovered its principle.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is so easy to be in our mind, but when they all shake the chairs, their mind is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The more they shake the chairs, the more their mind is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We do need the chair-shaking !</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I do not encourage you to do this literally, but we need this in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In my last trip to Taiwan, some of the brothers told me that the chair-shaking Christians had built a big magnificent church building, and they told me where they got the money.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A rich man was sick, and no doctors could help him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then the chair-shakers went to see him, knelt down around him, and shook their chairs and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He was healed!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I am not preaching for them, but there is something here.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He was thoroughly healed and so happy, so he gave them a large amount of money and told them to build a church.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You may say that it is not good to shake the chairs, but the Lord healed the man.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I do not encourage you to shake the chairs, but there is a principle we must see.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>People who are so much in the mind really need to shake the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They are so religious and so full of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>They know everything, but they are so dead and cold and have nearly nothing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>What they need is the shaking off of all their knowledge so that they may be turned to the Spirit to enjoy life.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Lord has turned the age.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In Revelation there is no religion and no doctrine, but the tree of life, the water of life, the crown of life, and the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord is living, not religious.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We too must be full of life, not full of doctrines and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We must not be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We must drop all the doctrines and teachings and be filled with the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The last book of the Bible has no doctrine and no religion but is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must be filled with this life, and we must express this life.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is today s age.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>May the Lord turn us to the age of the sevenfold Spirit for the realization and enjoyment of life.</S>
