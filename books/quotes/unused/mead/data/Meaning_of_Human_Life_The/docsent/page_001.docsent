   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man s life is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scholars, historians, and philosophers through the centuries have sought to understand man and the meaning of human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Despite man s endeavors to probe into the secrets of the universe, the universe remains a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although many consider the universe and man s purpose on this earth to be an insoluble riddle, the Bible, one of God s greatest gifts to mankind, unlocks this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is God s revelation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It reveals the reality concerning God, the universe, man, the relationship between man and God, the relationships among men, and man s obligation to God, as seen through creation and the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PURPOSE OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s Word tells us that He is self-existing and ever-existing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In eternity past God was there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At a certain point He made a decision to create man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s desire was to have this man express Him in His image and represent Him with His authority on earth Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before God created man, He made billions of items in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He created the plant life, the animal life, and finally the highest life, the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can easily see that the plants were created for the animals, and the animals were created for mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, it is not easy to realize that man was made for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible tells us in the very first pages of Genesis that God s creation of man was different from His creation of all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let us illustrate this matter by using a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the regions of the world where there are long, harsh winters and extreme cold, most people are accustomed to wearing warm gloves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person s hand cannot fit into a handkerchief because it does not have the image or form of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the glove is in the image, the likeness, and the form of a hand, it is able to contain the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A glove is made in the form of a hand for the purpose of containing the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same way, the human life was created according to the image of God so that God could dispense Himself as the divine life into the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man was created not only to express God but also to be God s representative authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God wanted man to rule over this created earth with His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although God judged and sentenced His enemy, Satan, the created man was committed with the responsibility to execute this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man was to rule over a vast territory for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The unique way for man to express God and represent God is to receive God as his life that man may become a counterpart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man was created with the capacity to receive and contain God s divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All of man s human virtues, such as love, honor, and goodness, were created by God so that man may have God s life and live out the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE CREATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man s life is the highest created life, much higher in quality than the plant life or animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only so, man was created after God s kind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The animals in God s creation were created after their own kind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the animal life cannot contain or express the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, man was made after God s kind, with the ability and capacity to receive another life the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this respect man is unique in all God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Not only so, man is a vessel, a container Rom 9:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we are vessels of God, God wants to be our content.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Just as bottles are made to contain milk and beverages, we are made to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the reason that knowledge, wealth, material possessions, and accomplishments can never satisfy us, because we were created to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All human beings, regardless of their race or nationality, are vessels of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible, the word of God, divides this vessel into three parts the spirit, the soul, and the body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone is aware of his own physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is tangible, concrete, temporal, and lends itself to scientific investigation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we were to ask a chemistry professor, What are the physical properties that constitute man s physical makeup? he might produce an analysis chart and point out that human beings are composed of so many percent water, nitrogen, carbon, and various other elements.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a professor of chemistry, he would be correct, no doubt, according to his field of research.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, his research would be limited to the physical part of man s being, the part that is made up of the elements of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since the beginning of history man has sought to be free from the imprisonment of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has tried to find new ways of pleasing his overworked senses, only to find that it all has been done before.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although man has managed to prolong biological life, every man comes to the point where he has to admit that the body is a dead end. God s purpose for man does not focus on man s physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After examining man according to his view, a psychologist might say that besides man s body, man has an inward, hidden composition.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man has a mind, a thinking organ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He also has emotions, the faculty of inner feeling, capable of loving, hating, and being depressed and elated.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He might also point out that man has a will, a faculty for making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In short, man is a living, thinking, feeling, and deciding entity not mere animated dust but a real, living person, having a unique and distinctive personality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He would say that our inner self, our psychological self, is our real self, while our body is merely the outward shell of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Psyche, the root of such English words as psychiatry and psychology, comes from the Greek word meaning soul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Psychology is the study of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The three faculties of mind, will, and emotion compose the personality and are merely the components of the human soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The last two centuries of human history have seen the spectacular rise of the soul s powers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The great minds such as Churchill, Einstein, Emerson, and Dostoevsky have contributed an abundance of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The great wills have produced an abundance of decisive action in government and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without a doubt the soul has soared to its peak in the past few decades.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet in spite of man s great accomplishments, the sense of inner emptiness remains.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can conquer the moon, but within ourselves there remains some uncharted territory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can study the world s great philosophies and still not find the answer to the great questions concerning our human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We can obtain the highest education and yet remain restless and dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Within the soul of man, the search for the meaning of human life will always end in frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hidden and obscured, there is a faculty deep within man that has remained a mystery throughout all the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is deeper than the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Just as the life-giving marrow is hidden within the bone, hidden within the soul is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The spirit of man was made specifically to contain God Himself, to be filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Man is never satisfied because this deepest part still remains to be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Through the mind man is able only to consider God and know God objectively, but through the spirit man is able to contact God, contain God, and enjoy God.</S>
