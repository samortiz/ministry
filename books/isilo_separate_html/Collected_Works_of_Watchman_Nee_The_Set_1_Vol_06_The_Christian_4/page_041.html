Now we want to examine in the Bible five more ways to go to hell. My friends, this is indeed a solemn subject. This is a question concerning man's life and death. The salvation or perdition of a sinner is determined by his attitude towards these questions. I do not believe that there is a man on earth who wants to go to hell. People do not want to go to hell. Whenever the subject of hell is discussed, they turn pale and become afraid of what will happen in hell. Nevertheless, many are subconsciously walking on the way of hell. In their hearts they do not want to go to hell. But with their feet they are taking the way of hell. In the end when they arrive at the place where their feet have been walking all their life, they will have much regret. Hence, the most important question for us and the one that we all have to take heed of is how can we not go to hell. But first we must know the ways to go to hell so we can know how to avoid them. I hope that all those sitting here are seekers of the truth, and I hope that no one here is uninterested and unconcerned about the destination of their soul. Even if some are unfortunately indifferent toward the question of eternal life and death in the future and are very careless in your walk, I hope you will be awakened to turn, seek, and receive eternal life through hearing God's gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The First Way to Hell:<br>Lying</H2><P>I have one verse, and the word here is very solemn. "All the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death" (Rev. 21:8). The Bible mentions hell many times. If there is no hell, there is no God because if God does not punish the world, then He is not God. Without hell, there would be no need for the Lord Jesus because everyone would be able to go to heaven, and there would be no need for Him to come to be our Savior. Without hell, there would be no need for the gospel because everyone would be saved, and there would be no need for a gospel to save sinners. Without hell, there would be no need for preachers because without the fearful punishment of hell there would be no need to preach. Alas, hell is real, and all the sinful sinners will go there. For this reason sinners should hear the gospel and believe in the gospel. This is why I have to preach the gospel to you today.</P><P>The verse that we just read tells us that in the future there will be a lake of fire and brimstone. This will be the second death. Please notice that what we fear the most is death. But the Bible says that there is not just one death but two. The death of the flesh is not the end. In the future there will be a second death. In the second death our whole being will be cast eternally into the lake of fire and brimstone and will suffer punishment and pain for our sins. Hell in the Bible refers to the lake of fire and brimstone. The Bible mentions the teaching of hell many times, specifically telling us the kind of people who will go to hell.</P><P>This verse says that people who lie will go to hell. Many people consider lying an ordinary sin and one which is not important. I am a native of Foochow. In Foochow we have a busy bridge called "the Great Bridge." Countless numbers of people pass over this bridge everyday. The people of Foochow have a saying: "Three days without lying and the Great Bridge would be without pedestrians." How common is lying! We do not follow the Bible teaching of having our yes be yes and our no, no (James 5:12). Instead we change our words back and forth, gossip, and criticize. We think that it is a very little matter for us to lie. But the Bible says that those who lie will go to hell. Therefore, those who are sitting here should be careful. Please examine yourselves if you have lied. You will go to hell if you have!</P><P>How common is lying! For many people, two or three out of every ten sentences are lies. It seems impossible for them to start off any sentence with the truth. I remember that we had a very honest person in our house. He never lied. Whatever was yes he said yes and whatever was no he said no. He was forthright and honest. Others, however, did not value his honesty; they thought that he was foolish. There is a common saying that being honest is foolish indeed. Yes, in this sinful world, people do not know about honesty. If you want to be honest, others will say that you are a foolish cow. How pitiful that the world considers honesty foolishness! Yet this is the level of their moral standards. What else can we say?</P><P>Many people, in an attempt to earn a reputation for themselves of being clever and smart, use many deceitful words to cheat others. They may indeed earn a name of being clever and smart. But are they really clever and smart? This is only deceitfulness and craftiness. Most of the people in the world who are clever and smart are actually deceitful and crafty. Moreover, the world realizes that the so-called clever and smart ones are actually deceitful and crafty. They know. They may know better than we do. But they still call these ones clever and smart. Why is this? They accept this lie because they are also used to lying. To someone who lies, a deceitful and crafty person is clever and smart. Oh, how the world excels in lying!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
