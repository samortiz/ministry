   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LINE OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The two terms reformation or restoration are not so adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The proper word should be recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the human mind, Martin Luther brought the reformation in. But actually in God's eyes he was used by God to recover only a part or one aspect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was used by God to recover the aspect of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually that was the recovery of Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That "utensil" had gotten lost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That utensil in the holy temple had been carried away by Catholicism into Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then God used Martin Luther to bring that utensil back.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Justification by faith is actually Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That aspect was one of the leading utensils in God's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But it was carried away by Catholicism and lost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then God came in to use Martin Luther to bring this utensil back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, the recovery began when Paul was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he wrote 2 Timothy he wrote in a sense of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time the church had been ruined already.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So Paul wrote 2 Timothy to recover and inoculate the corrupted church life with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Apostle John, who wrote his books about twenty-five years later than Paul, also wrote to recover.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Gospel of John was written to recover, his Epistles were written to recover, and Revelation was written to recover.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By reading the seven epistles in Revelation, you can see that they are recovery epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some of the churches had become corrupted and lost their testimony, so the seven epistles were written to recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the end of the first century the recovery began, and it has not stopped to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By reading church history you can see that the recovery has been going on in every century.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From the end of the first century until today there is a line of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This recovery has been increasing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord's recovery has never been in such an intensified scale as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the Lord's recovery existed even before Martin Luther, it was not noticed by the worldly people because it was hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>History tells us that the Catholic Church killed more Christians than the Roman Empire did.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that the Lord was doing a recovery work there, and the Catholic Church was killing people who would take care of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through all those centuries under the Roman Empire and under the Roman Church the recovery was going on strongly and forcefully.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Roman Church utilized the secular rulers to kill the recovery people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Church of England burned some faithful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Madame Guyon was in the recovery, and she was put into prison by the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John Bunyon, the writer of Pilgrim's Progress, was persecuted by the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are examples of the recovery people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's recovery of the church life began to be apparent with Zinzendorf two and one-half centuries ago.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He practiced the church life as part of the recovery in Bohemia.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then later in Britain the Brethren received even more light concerning the church, and they practiced the church life in a fuller way than Zinzendorf had.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now today we also are practicing the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Zinzendorf practiced the church life in the 1700s, the Brethren practiced the church life in the 1800s, and today we are practicing the church life in the 1900s.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We consider this as three steps: Zinzendorf's practice, the Brethren practice, and now the practice among us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, the recovery is getting fuller and richer as it progresses.</S>
