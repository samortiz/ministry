   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LEARNING AND EXERCISE NEEDED BY THOSE WHO WORK FOR THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All those who have studied in school know that whether in high school, junior college, or a university the education provided covers many subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even if you specialize in a certain subject, the school will provide an education that covers multiple lines rather than just a single line.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, if you major in a foreign language, you still have to study other subjects such as history and Chinese literature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You will also need to receive training in other areas such as physical education, ethics, and character.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, while we are learning to work for the Lord and live for God, we must be equipped in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must realize that just because we have "passed beyond all earthly bribe" Hymns, #473, stanza 1 , this does not mean that we can be full-timers who forget about everything and simply work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, we still must learn many things and be equipped in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A person who desires to work for the Lord and live for God must learn many things and be exercised in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first thing you need is to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Life is a matter of primary importance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without life, there is no way to live the Christian life, to work for the Lord, or to function in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second thing you need is to be equipped with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third thing you need is to be built up in character.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fourth thing you need is to exercise to be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fifth thing is to exercise to fellowship with the Lord moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Due to their negligence in this matter, many have gotten themselves into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sixth thing is to walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seventh thing is to consecrate yourselves to the Lord every day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You all need to learn these basic things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Finally, you need to be equipped with languages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition, there are two important things which you need to learn: to exercise faith and to exercise to learn to endure suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE EXERCISE OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The exercise of faith is a very fundamental matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must see that today our living is entirely contrary to communism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Communism is materialistic, being concerned altogether with material things, whereas we are God-centered, being concerned altogether with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To live a life that is altogether centered on God, we need faith, not sight 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With communism, everything is by sight; with us, everything is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we must exercise faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Bodily Illnesses</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, we must learn to exercise faith when we are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This does not mean that we are superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are sick, we still have to see a doctor and take medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a two-sided matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, every day God sustains us not by signs and wonders but through a normal diet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not think that since we trust in God, we can survive without eating, just like the Lord Jesus did when He was tempted by Satan for forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, we should not think that as long as we eat, we will be healthy and strong and will live long.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In fact, even if we eat properly, we may still get sick, even with some fatal illness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we must trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, even if we have only a cold, we still have to learn to trust in God's healing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not seek miracles but should see a doctor and take medicine while also trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With some, once they go to a doctor and take medicine, they give up their trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With others, once they believe in God, they become superstitious and would never go to see a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both are too much.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Brother Watchman Nee was young, Sister M. E. Barber was the person who gave him the most help.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She never went to see a doctor or took medicine in her whole life, so she lived to only around sixty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even Paul told Timothy, "No longer drink water only, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses" 1 Tim 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot say that Paul had little faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I feel that M. E. Barber was a little bit too much.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, she could have lived longer and could have been more useful in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, for our benefit and the Lord's, we must learn this matter of exercising faith.</S>
