   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE OF READING THE BREASTPLATE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: In chapter four of this book pp.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>47-48 , you mentioned that the leading brothers should exercise to "read the saints," just as the high priest in the Old Testament read the stones on the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Could you share something further concerning this?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Answer: This is based upon the type of the high priest's breastplate with the Urim and Thummim Exo 28:30; Lev 8:8; Num 27:21; Deut 33:8; 1 Sam 28:6; Ezra 2:63; Neh 7:65 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The government among God's people in the Old Testament was neither by autocracy nor by democracy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This government was by theocracy, which means that God governed the people directly, yet through some agents.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today in the church there should also be theocracy, God's governing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Old Testament there is a type of God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among the children of Israel, God set up the elders and appointed the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The elders did not govern the people according to their opinion or view but according to the direct word from God received by the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way the high priest received the word of God directly was by means of the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the breastplate were twelve precious stones, and each stone bore a name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The twelve names of the twelve tribes only required eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The remaining four letters were put on a piece called the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thummim means completion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These four added letters completed the Hebrew alphabet on the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the Urim was added to the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Urim means light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When there was a problem among the children of Israel, the high priest bearing the breastplate went into the presence of God to seek God's direction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By the shining of the Urim upon the stones, the high priest received God's instant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was in this way that, letter by letter, the high priest was able to spell out a word, then a sentence, and then a paragraph, until the full judgment of God was determined.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the high priest passed on God's speaking to the elders, and the elders executed what God had spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to experience this type of reading the breastplate in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we are both elders and priests.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the church has a problem and the elders need to see how the church should go on, they should go to God with much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way the elders will become clear about what the church should do and how the church should go on.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the presence of the Lord through prayer, they can read the letters on the stones of the breastplate, which is to read all the members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By reading the members of the church, taking the members as the letters of a divine typewriter, God's speaking will come to them, telling them what to do and how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Old Testament times, they had the law of Moses as the constant, written Word, but to have the written Word of God by itself was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They still needed the instant word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They received the instant word by the high priest going into the presence of God to read the names of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need both the constant word, the word in the Bible, and the instant word, the word from the present contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The instant word should not contradict the constant word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that today our guidance from God should correspond with what is written in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By this way we can have the leading from the Lord day after day concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This matter also shows how organic the eldership should be.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The eldership is not organizational, but it is altogether an organic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The elders need to be living and exercised in contacting the Lord to be enlightened to read the situation among the Lord's people.</S>
