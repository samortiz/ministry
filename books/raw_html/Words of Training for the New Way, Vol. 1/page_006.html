 <h2 class="head1">THE BELIEFS IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We have already seen the basic principles of administration and finances in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Following this, we need to know the beliefs in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Our beliefs are pure, orthodox, and scriptural.</p>
<p>First, we believe that every word in the sixty-six books of the Bible is the divine speaking revealed by God. That is, we believe that the Bible is the divine authority.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit&mdash;is uniquely one, though three. Now He has become the Spirit and can enter into us to live in us and to be our life. Not only did He become our Savior on the cross, but today, even the more, He is the indwelling Spirit to be our life and to be with us.</p>
<p>Third, we believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God Himself. He became a man, a God-man. This is the person of Christ. He died for us on the cross, bearing our sins and terminating all the old creation. Moreover, He rose from among the dead, releasing the life of God and producing God&rsquo;s new creation to be the Body of Christ. This is the work of Christ.</p>
<p>Fourth, we believe that the Body of Christ&mdash;the church&mdash; is unique in the entire universe, just as the moon in the sky is unique. This unique church expressed in the localities throughout the world is the many local churches. We as the members in these churches should love one another and keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Fifth, we believe that the Lord Jesus will come again. These are our major beliefs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Concerning the way of practice, the work, and the meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we believe that the most effective way to preach the gospel, according to the revelation in the Bible, is to take the gospel directly into people&rsquo;s homes by door-to-door visitation so that they may believe and be baptized to belong to the Lord. Then we establish home meetings in the homes of the saved ones to teach them the truth and lead them to grow. Gradually, when a few homes come together, they can form a small group meeting. Then a few small group meetings can form a district meeting. Next a few district meetings can gather in a larger place to meet together. These meetings in a larger meeting place with everyone coming together may be only once every few months, or twice a year. This is our way of practice at the present time. We would like to come back to the Bible and, according to what we have fellowshipped here today, practice taking care of the spreading of the gospel and have saints meeting in homes everywhere with everyone functioning. This is the way we need to take today.</p>
