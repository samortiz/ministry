   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH ALL THE HINDRANCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO HAVE A LIVING OF BEARING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not need to make up our mind to endeavor to bring someone to the Lord each year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not what we are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, we should all have a proper Christian life, a life with no distractions, frustrations, or addictions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should pray, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By Your mercy and through Your grace I am here absolutely for You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have no desire, likes, dislikes, addictions, or frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have nothing but You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you give me something, I will take it, but if You do not give it to me, I do not desire it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not care for long hair or short hair.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because I am a human, I need something to cover me, and I do not desire to give people the impression that I am sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, I do not love my coat and tie.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, I shave every morning because I wish to be a right person and not give people a wrong impression, but I do not love shaving or not shaving.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not love anything, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I love only You, and if I love something else, prune it off.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we pray in this way, we will be refreshed, and we will have a life that produces fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not by our endeavoring, doing, willing, or making up our mind to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That will not work, and even if it did work, we would bring forth fruit only according to what we are in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be pruned by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not a holiness people, like the Amish who are allowed to wear only certain colors.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We simply desire to have a proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>More than forty years ago, when I was in Shanghai, a group of young missionaries went to China with the China Inland Mission, many of whom were sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Certain older sisters who had been in Shanghai for a while had learned what a Western missionary needed to do to convince the conservative Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The newer, younger sisters, however, arrived from England wearing their skirts only a little below the knee.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In those days that was considered a very modern style, and some even considered it to be sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was a certain older sister who loved the Lord and had been working in China for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She realized that all these young British missionaries with short skirts could never be fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The stubborn, conservative Chinese people would say, What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You are immoral.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why should we listen to you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, she dared not say anything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, she served tea to them every afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then while the young sisters sat around her, enjoying their tea, she would adjust her own longer skirt.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The young sisters watched her do this, and then they looked at their own bare legs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This caused them to be bothered within.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since all those young missionaries loved the Lord, they were convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord touched them, and they dealt with Him about their dress.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they had not done this, they may not have had the peace to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they had said, Lord, save the Chinese people, the Lord might have said, Let me save you first.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then I will answer your prayer for China.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was not simply a matter of an outward change; it was an inward touching by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way their preaching of the gospel to the Chinese people became a living, not merely a work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To make our preaching a work is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not carrying out a job in our preaching; we are living a life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, if anything hinders us in our fellowship with the Lord, we should say, Lord, prune this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I give You the freedom to cut it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what is meant by the Lord s word, Every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Lord s recovery we do not practice to have regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to my own conscience, I could not smoke a cigarette and then partake of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, we have never passed a regulation against smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not believe in regulations, but neither do we believe that those who smoke are able to have the best remembrance of the Lord at His table.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Likewise, we cannot believe that those who love shopping can have the overflow of the inner life to bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we do not wish to encourage, charge, or stir up anyone to have a mere gospel preaching work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, what we need in the Lord s recovery is for many dear saints who love the Lord and mean business with Him to constantly be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should pray, Lord, I am one with You in my shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whatever You do not want to buy, I also do not want to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If You want to buy something, I will buy it only because You are buying it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may also say, Lord, I do not care for short hair, long hair, a beard, or no beard.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I care only for You and for what You want.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In my whole life, as one saved by You and under Your transformation, I like nothing and I dislike nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have no love for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>My love is only for You.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I want You to prune everything that is not Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we always remain in this condition, we will be the pruned branches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A pruned branch always has fresh, new, tender shoots that bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who keep vineyards know that the branches of the vines bring forth fruit only at the fresh shoots.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all need to have fresh shoots.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the sisters who love to have many pairs of shoes would say, Lord, prune me in this matter, and they allow the Lord to do it, they will have a new shoot full of freshness, newness, and tenderness, and a good cluster of grapes will be brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is no need to say that we must deal with sinful matters.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the Lord s recovery we all hate anything sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, there are many other items which are not sinful that we still hold on to.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These matters deaden us even though we still endeavor to preach the gospel and bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord will not honor this kind of endeavoring very much.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why we all need to go to the Lord, not to will or to make up our mind but to have a thorough dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must lay ourselves on the altar and say, Lord, strip off my covering, cut me, and shine upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Expose me, and show me the true situation with my likes and dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then if we go along with the Lord s exposing and enlightening, and we have a thorough dealing with Him, we will be fruitful.</S>
