<h2 class="head3">3. The Five Prudent Ones<br />Taking Oil in Their Vessels</h2><p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;But the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps.&rdquo; Man is a vessel made for God (Rom. 9:21, 23-24), and man&rsquo;s personality is in his soul. Hence, vessels here signify the soul of the believers. The five prudent virgins not only have oil in their lamps, but also take oil in their vessels. Having oil in their lamps signifies that they have the Spirit of God dwelling in their spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16), and taking oil in their vessels signifies that they have the fullness of the Spirit of God saturating their souls.</p><p>We need to be very clear about the lamps and the vessels. According to the Hebrew text, Proverbs 20:27 says that the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord. Within the lamp is the oil, the Holy Spirit. The New Testament reveals that our spirit is the place the Holy Spirit indwells. According to Romans 9, we are vessels made by God. Our being, our personality, is in our soul. Therefore, the vessel in this verse signifies our soul. Through regeneration we have the Spirit of God in our spirit. This causes our lamp to burn. But the question is whether or not we have the extra portion of the Holy Spirit filling our soul. Although we have the oil in our lamp, we need the extra portion of the oil in our soul. This signifies that the Spirit must spread from within our spirit to every part of our soul. Then in our soul we shall have an extra amount of the Holy Spirit. If we have this extra portion, we are prudent. If we do not have it, we are foolish. In other words, if we are indifferent to the infilling of the Holy Spirit, we are foolish. If we are wise, we shall pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me. I want to have Your Spirit not only in my spirit, but also in my soul. Lord, I need the infilling of the Spirit. I need the extra portion of the Holy Spirit to fill my entire being.&rdquo; Without this extra portion of the Spirit, we cannot be watchful or ready. In order to be watchful and ready, we need the infilling of the Holy Spirit, the spreading of the Spirit Himself from our spirit to every part of our inward being.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Bridegroom Delaying</h2><p>Verse 5 says that the Bridegroom delayed His coming. The Lord Jesus truly has delayed His coming again. In Revelation He promised to come quickly, but nearly two thousand years have passed, and still He delays his coming.</p><h2 class="head3">5. All the Virgins<br />Becoming Drowsy and Sleeping</h2><p>Because the Bridegroom delayed His coming, all the virgins &ldquo;became drowsy and slept.&rdquo; Becoming drowsy signifies becoming sick (Acts 9:37; 1 Cor. 11:30), and going to sleep signifies dying (1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-13). While the Lord delays His coming back, the majority of the believers firstly become sick and then die.</p><h2 class="head3">6. A Cry at Midnight</h2><p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!&rdquo; Midnight signifies the darkest time of this dark age (night). That will be the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation. &ldquo;Cry&rdquo; signifies the voice of the archangel (1 Thes. 4:16).</p><h2 class="head3">7. All the Virgins Arising</h2><p>Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.&rdquo; &ldquo;Arose&rdquo; signifies resurrection from the dead (1 Thes. 4:14). This is the resurrection predicted in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and 1 Corinthians 15:52.</p><h2 class="head3">8. Trimming Their Lamps</h2><p>After the virgins arose, they &ldquo;trimmed their lamps.&rdquo; This signifies their dealing with their testimony in life. This indicates that after resurrection our life for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony will still need to be dealt with if it is not perfect before we die.</p>
