   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The covenant is a matter of righteousness according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every covenant is something legal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A covenant actually is a kind of legal agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It fulfills the requirement of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there is no fulfillment of the requirement of the law, the covenant means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The covenant is also a matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul said in Romans that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Unto salvation means for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To do anything we need power.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gospel is the power of God for us to be saved, for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed v. 17 . God has saved us not only by His love and not only by His grace but also by His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His righteousness binds Him, and His righteousness gives us the ground, the standing, to say, "God, You have to save me."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God did not save us when we repented and believed into the Lord Jesus, He would not be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's Son, our Savior, died for us to fulfill all the requirements of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That was according to the law, so the law has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The legal requirements of God have been fulfilled by our Savior according to God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, God has to save us according to His righteousness.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before the death of our Savior, God could condemn us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We did not have any ground to claim any kind of justification, forgiveness, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But now His death has accomplished all the requirements of God's righteousness according to His law, so this death gives us a righteous ground.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the early years of my Christian life, I was not this bold.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was afraid that God might regret that He made a mistake in saving me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If He were to change His mind, my salvation would be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later I came to know that God saved me not only by love and not only by grace but also by righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether we are good or bad, God has to save us because our Savior died for us to fulfill all of God's righteousness.</S>
