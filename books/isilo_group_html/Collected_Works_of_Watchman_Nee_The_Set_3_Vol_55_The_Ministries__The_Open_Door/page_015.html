I have nothing, know nothing, and am worth less than a dead fly because I can only commit sin and come short of His glory.</p><p>Honorable Mr. Nee! I hope you will remember me, the most pitiful among the pitiful ones, before God often! May He completely gain this lowly, worthless person and strip off all that is not from God Himself.</p><p>Early this morning, my elder brother told me a little about the brothers and sisters in Shanghai and how they had handed over themselves and all they had to the church for God's use. Oh! I am so happy for them! Because I feel that this is such a great blessing, an indescribable desire, need, and hope swelled up in me to participate in this blessing.</p><p>Honorable Mr. Nee! I now present my body completely to the church and offer it to God. Could you please answer me and tell me if the church accepts it? I really want to be completely gained by God! I want so very much to be His slave for my entire life! May God have more mercy on me!</p><p>Everything of the past has passed away. I can only ask God for forgiveness. May He give me a new, good beginning! Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>Your very young brother in the Lord,<br />XX<br />April 20, 1948</p><p> (First-year medical student at Central University, Nanking)</p><h2 class="head1">IS IT POSSIBLE TO LEARN TO SERVE GOD<br />BY ENTERING ANOTHER PROFESSION?</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to the honorable Brother Witness:</p><p>With respect to the situation here, I believe that Brother Caleb and Brother Yin-xin have already spoken to you, so I do not need to mention it again. Five years ago I spoke with you, when we were about to depart from Brother Wang Jing-bo's house, concerning whether or not I could enter another profession and still maintain my present standing to learn to serve God. I was put into an environment several times in which I wanted to try, but the Lord never allowed me to do it. He always turned me back with His powerful hand. I have not dared to do any business; I am only waiting for the Lord's time and looking to His leading and arrangement. Please give me a little confirmation, and I hope you will pray for me. May the Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Wang Yi-xien<br />April 24, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: 5 Xiang-Shui Street, East Blvd., Baotou, Suiyuan</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
