   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE WORK OF CHRIST RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECAUSE OF OUR JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already mentioned that the Lord Jesus died for us and for our sins Rom 5:8; 1 Cor 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen how the Lord accomplished God's righteousness and, at the same time, manifested God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we have to ask a question.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How do we know that the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ has been accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How do we know that such a work was accepted by God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we say that the Lord Jesus has fulfilled God's righteous requirements, what does God have to say about this?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can God show us that His Son has indeed accomplished the work of redemption and indeed met His requirements?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is true that the Lord Jesus died for us and for our sins and that His work was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the cross before He died He clearly said, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is true that He finished the work of redemption He set out to do on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was able to say that it was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every one of us who has looked forward to His salvation can also say that it is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But how do we know that the Lord's work of redemption is acceptable to God when it is presented before Him?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How do we know that the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus was approved by God?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is all right for us to say that the Lord's work has passed the test.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But what does God have to say?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can say that Jesus died on the cross and accomplished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But how do we know that our God is fully satisfied with such a work?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that the Lord's work of redemption is most reasonable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But how do we know that the same is true to God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We say that the work of redemption is fully righteous, but would God say that it is righteous also?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we look at the cross, we say that all things are settled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when God looks at the cross, is everything settled in His eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to realize that there is no way to know whether or not God is satisfied based on the cross of the Lord Jesus alone; there is no way to find out whether or not God considers it final.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there were only the cross, if we only had the Lord's death, if the cross alone were to remain with us until today, and if the Lord's tomb had never been emptied, we would not know what the work of the Lord's death has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regarding the redemptive work of the Lord, there is not only the aspect of the cross but the aspect of resurrection as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE LORD'S RESURRECTION IS THE PROOF</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>OF GOD'S ACCEPTANCE OF HIS REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Tonight we are not going to speak about everything related to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, just as we did not share about everything related to His death the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Earlier we spoke only about the objective aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Tonight we will also consider only the objective aspect of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Objectively, the Lord died a substitutionary death for us; He died on behalf of all 1 Pet 3:18; 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, He died for our sins 1 Cor 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what the Lord's death accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What then is the purpose of His resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God raised up the Lord Jesus from the dead as a proof that the work of redemption has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has justified and approved it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now He is satisfied.</S>
