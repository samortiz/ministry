<p>Those who experience the altar of burnt offering build with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). Gold refers to the divine life and nature. Silver refers to Christ&rsquo;s redemption and to the principle of the cross. Precious stones refer to God&rsquo;s image. The work of believers who experience the altar of burnt offering is full of the element of God, has the power of the cross, and expresses God.</p>
<p>Those who do not experience the altar of burnt offering work according to what they are. They build with wood, grass, and stubble (v. 12). Wood refers to the nature of the natural man. Grass refers to the man of the flesh (1 Pet. 1:24). Stubble refers to things grown out of the earth, earthly things. Human methods and common practices in society are of the earth, not of heaven. Precious stones denote the heavenly atmosphere; in contrast, stubble denotes the earthly situation. Only work that is produced through burning is of gold, silver, and precious stones. The work that is not produced through burning is of wood, grass, and stubble.</p>
<p>The day will come when the work of each will be tested by fire (1 Cor. 3:13). If our work is the issue of fire, our work will stand the test of fire. Gold, silver, and precious stones are of God and are produced through His burning. As such, the work of gold, silver, and precious stones will endure being tested by God&rsquo;s fire. Furthermore, those who carry out such a work will receive a reward (v. 14). If our work is according to the natural man, by the flesh, and earthy, it is of wood, grass, and stubble. When the work of each is manifested by fire, such a work will not endure the test but will be consumed, and we will suffer loss (v. 15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE KINDS OF BURNING</h2>
<p>Those who have a desire to serve God must remember that our God is a consuming fire (Heb. 12:29). When God comes to the earth, fire comes to the earth. When God enters into man, fire enters into man and burns in him. The degree of burning may be different, but every believer experiences being burned. God is not cold. He is fire that energizes and burns. Those who draw near to God experience the burning. God is a consuming fire, and His eyes are like a flame of fire (Rev. 1:14). Whoever touches Him will be burned.</p>
<p>The divine fire burns on the altar for acceptance and for salvation. A person who is willing to come to the altar will be saved and accepted. If a person approaches God according to his concept, instead of being burned on the altar, he will be consumed, just as Nadab and Abihu were consumed by fire. Nadab and Abihu did not touch the fire on the altar of burnt offering. As a result, they were consumed by God at the incense altar. If we are not willing to be burned at the altar of burnt offering, we will be burned at the incense altar. If we will not let the cross kill us, one day the eyes that are like a flame of fire will burn us. God is a consuming fire, and He will burn us either way.</p>
<p>Someone might stubbornly say, &ldquo;I will not be a Christian; then I will escape the burning.&rdquo; Every Christian will surely be burned either in this age or in the coming age. However, if you are not a Christian, you will definitely be burned in the end. Even the devil will ultimately be burned by fire (20:10). All those who are not found written in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire (v. 15). No one can avoid being tested by fire. If we know the Bible, we also know that the destination of the old creation is the burning of fire (2 Pet. 3:7, 10, 12).</p>
<p>Those who are willing to be burned on the altar of the cross today will be accepted and saved by God in that day. However, those who are not willing to be burned by the cross will one day suffer loss before God, just as Nadab and Abihu suffered loss. Contrarily, those who reject salvation and the Savior will end up in the lake of fire. No one can avoid the fire of God.</p>
<p>These words are not intended to threaten anyone. The corrupted human race, the natural man, needs to go through fire. However, there are three kinds of burning. The first kind is the burning at the altar, which is for salvation and acceptance. It is precious and glorious. The issue of this burning is that we become a sweet fragrance to God, and we have the appearance of precious stones. The second kind of burning is for the believers who are not willing to be dealt with or to be broken. One day their work will be proved by fire. They will suffer loss, but they themselves will be saved, yet so as through fire. These two kinds of burning are for believers. The third kind of burning is for those who reject the Lord and His salvation. These people will be cast into the lake of fire forever. Everyone will be burned; no one can escape.</p>
<p>The best kind of burning is the burning on the altar of burnt offering. This is sweet and glorious. May the Lord have mercy on us and show us where we should stand and what we should do. The service in the New Testament is not of us but of Him working through us. We should place ourselves on the altar of the cross, not pitying or loving ourselves, but rather hating and dealing with the self by putting everything we have on the altar in order to be gained by God. Then fire will descend on the altar to burn us. The issue of this burning will be a service. May the Lord grant us grace.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Service for Building Up the House of God &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
