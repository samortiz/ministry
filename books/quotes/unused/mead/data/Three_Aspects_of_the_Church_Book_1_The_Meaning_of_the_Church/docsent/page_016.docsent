   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Sequence of God s Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God must first work in the church until the church is full of life inwardly and is entirely subject to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then the church will be one and will arrive at the oneness v. 13 . After God has worked thoroughly in the church, the restoration of all things will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s work begins with the church and then spreads outward, passing through the church to all things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church arrives at the oneness through the church s arriving at the full knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All things will be enlightened by the light that shines out through the oneness of the church, all will know Jehovah in the light of the oneness of the church cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isa 11:9 , and all will be brought under the Head to arrive at the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 3:21 speaks of the restoration of all things, and Romans 8:21-22 says, In hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two verses indicate that the restoration of all things will occur when the children of God enjoy the freedom of glory, that is, when God has completed His work in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through the completion of His work in the church, God will bring the church completely into glory so that she may be delivered from the old creation and fully enter into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time, the church will be completely in oneness without any discord, fully in glory, and entirely God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All things will be in life, oneness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The creation is anxiously watching and eagerly awaiting the coming of the day of the manifestation of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God, however, seems to be saying to the creation, You must first wait until I have thoroughly completed my work in the church, and then I will work in you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>James 1:18 says that God s purpose is that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be the firstfruits is an inward matter related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is the firstfruits because God s life reaches and works in the believers in order that they may be the first to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The issue of this maturity is the church arriving at the one accord, the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wherever God s life flows, death is swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The opposite of life is death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only life can swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s life entering into us can be compared to an injection that first operates in us and then in others, causing us to be the firstfruits in life among all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we fully mature and enter into glory, God will carry out the restoration of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s life works to head up all things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This heading up is practical in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the church service, at times different opinions may arise, all may insist on their own view, and some may be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that we are not headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, once God s life comes into a situation, light shines, grace comes, and in the light we condemn ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We not only stop arguing, but the disharmony in us also vanishes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the end the church receives a great supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only are the serving ones brought into harmony, but under this shining all the brothers and sisters will arrive at the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If those serving in coordination are not willing to receive the Lord s shining, but instead receive Satan s death, the entire church will be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, the brothers and sisters will speak different things, and the church will be in chaos, having neither the Head nor the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that darkness and the devil are reigning and that lies have been enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must have a clear vision that life comes from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once life comes, light is produced; once light functions, men are brought into oneness and headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Revelation 22, when the New Jerusalem is manifested, the throne of God is in its midst, and from the throne of God proceeds a river of water of life with the tree of life along both sides of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The river of water of life with the tree of life is winding in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This river is a sign of the water of life operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All that is expressed in the New Jerusalem comes from the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Jerusalem the throne of God is the center, there is no discord, and everything is in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The city is a ripened fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In chapter 21 we see that God placed the city in the center of the new universe so that the nations might walk by its light v. 24 . Without the city, the nations would be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being in darkness is equivalent to being in death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Darkness is always a sign of death; moreover, being in death is to be void of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the nations walk by the light of the New Jerusalem, all things are one in the light of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Isaiah 2:5 says, House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah, and 11:9 says, The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The knowledge of Jehovah is light, and light brings everyone into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the brothers and sisters are not in one accord, not in oneness, and not headed up in the workers homes, death will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The meaning of death is to be severed from Christ and from the authority of God and to fall into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a brother has life operating in him, is under the throne of God, and has the river of life with the water of life and the tree of life continually flowing in him, he will be nourished and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He will be subject to the authority of God and will not have any discord with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He will be as the New Jerusalem, which is of pure gold without any mixture, he will be absolutely one with God, and he will be full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a result of this brother s presence in the workers home, the light of life will shine forth and enlighten the entire home, enabling others to walk by his light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The light of life from within him will dispel the darkness in the workers home, and the power of life within him will swallow up any death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if the brothers have opinions and are fleshly, and the sisters are not in harmony because of their tempers, this one brother s presence will be as the shining of the New Jerusalem and will eliminate all the quarrels and disharmony.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The flesh will not be able to operate, and tempers will not flare up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result of his shining, the entire workers home will walk in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Darkness will be dispelled, and death will be swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everyone will be in one accord and headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is how God works to produce firstfruits in the workers home and to bring the entire home into the light.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today all things are in darkness, death, and discord, but God has chosen the church from among all things, set the church apart, and infused His life into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today this life is flowing in the church, bringing God s authority, that is, the throne of God, into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When life has completely finished its work in the church, the church will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s light will then shine forth through the New Jerusalem, bringing all things into the light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At that time darkness will be dispelled and death will have no place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Revelation 21:24 says, The nations will walk by its light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The life of God is in the church and shines forth from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eventually, all things will walk by the light of life which the church has received; however, the universe itself will not receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today in the church, the condition of some brothers and sisters may be compared to the center of the new universe, the New Jerusalem, which shines forth the life of God, but the condition of others may be compared to the surrounding nations, which receive the shining and influence of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the life of the Head is fully manifested in the church, all things will be headed up Eph 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When God completely finishes His work in the church, it will be the New Jerusalem, a transparent city.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All the gold in the New Jerusalem is transparent, transmitting the effulgence of God, so that by its light all things may arrive at the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The light effaces death in all things and heads up all things.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The city diffuses the light, shining upon the nations, and the glory of the nations is brought back to the city Rev 21:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, the carrying out of God s purpose in heading up all things depends entirely upon the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should not believe those who say that the Lord Jesus will come tomorrow and rapture us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For the past one hundred years, many people have said repeatedly that the Lord is coming and that we will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We do believe in the Lord s coming and in the rapture, but the crucial point is that the church is not yet mature.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We do not need to preach the truth regarding rapture and the Lord s coming, but we do need to preach the truth regarding the believers need to be mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today the church is still very immature.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The harvest has not yet ripened and is not ready for the Lord to reap.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Hence, all things cannot yet be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I encourage those who study prophecies to put the prophecies aside and to focus on maturing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Everything hinges on whether or not God s children mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The fullness of the times spoken of in Ephesians 1:10 is not something we can discover through calculation but is something that can be attained only when the church reaches maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If the church does not mature for another thousand years, the fullness of the times will take another thousand years to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, every one of us in the church are responsible for allowing the Lord to work and shine in us and to be diffused through us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If those who serve together in the church cannot be headed up, we should not expect the entire universe to be headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>For us to be mature in life, we must let the cross break us, provide God the opportunity to deal with us, and allow Christ s life to have the ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Only when Christ is able to diffuse Himself out through us are we mature.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In that day the nations and all things will walk by our light and be brought under the authority of God through our shining.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>At that time, all things will be headed up in Christ.</S>
