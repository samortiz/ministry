   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Isaiah 53:7, the Lord did not open His mouth when He was oppressed and afflicted: He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that when the Lord was brought to the cross, he was like a sheep dumb before the shearers.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah 53:12 says, Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord poured out His soul as He was dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was crucified in the midst of two thieves and thereby was numbered with the transgressors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fact that He bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors was fulfilled by the Lord s prayer on the cross, Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing Luke 23:34a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Cut Off out of the Land of the Living</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to Isaiah 53:8, the Lord Jesus was cut off out of the land of the living.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Resurrected to See the Fruit of His Travail</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaiah 53:11 reveals that the Lord was resurrected to see the fruit of His travail: He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is in resurrection that the Lord sees the fruit of His travail.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now after His resurrection He, as the righteous Servant of God, justifies the many, whose iniquities He has borne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Exalted and Lifted Up Very High</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For a Covenant of the People</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and a Light of the Gentiles</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Isaiah 42:6 says, I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and will give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After His ascension, the Lord became a covenant of the Jewish people and a light of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that in ascension the Lord Jesus Himself became the new covenant, the new testament, to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He also became a light to the Gentiles, to the heathen, through the preaching of the gospel carried out by His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Salvation of God unto the End of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Isaiah 49:6 we see that the Lord is the salvation of God unto the end of the earth: And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not even in the New Testament can we find such a record.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By considering the prophecies in Isaiah concerning Christ as God s Slave, we can understand more fully what is recorded in the Gospel of Mark concerning Him as a Slave.</S>
