   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1b-10: 1 The devil, based upon God the Father s saying in His anointing to the God-man that He was God s beloved Son, tempted Him to make a show of Himself being the Son of God for His self-exaltation and self-glorification and to do a miracle to bid the stones to become loaves of bread for His hunger, but the God-man defeated him by not making a show of Himself and not caring for the loaves of bread but for every word of God vv.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Knowing that God wanted to destroy him by the man, in his flesh, that is, in his humanity, whom he had poisoned and spoiled, Satan took the strategy of tempting the first God-man to assume that He was the Son of God, standing far off from the position of His humanity.</S>
