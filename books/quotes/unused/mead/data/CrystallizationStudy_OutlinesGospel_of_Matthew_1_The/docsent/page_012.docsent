   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Twelve Denying the Self, Taking Up the Cross,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Losing the Soul-life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>for the Building of the Church Scripture Reading: Matt 16:16-28 In Matthew 16 the way to build up the church and the enemy of the building are revealed: Christ, the Son of the living God, builds the church on Himself as the rock, with stones such as Peter, a transformed person vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>16-18.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gates of Hades, Satan s authority or power of darkness, attacks the church to frustrate the Lord from building up the church v. 18.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to build the church, the Lord had to pass through death and enter into resurrection v. 21: The church was produced through Christ s death and resurrection John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The way to build the church is to be crucified and resurrected cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 Cor 4:10-12; Gal 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peter, with a good heart, rebuked the Lord and tried to prevent the Lord from going to Jerusalem to be crucified Matt 16:22: It was not Peter but Satan who came out through one of the gates of Hades, the gate of Peter s self, to try to frustrate the Lord from building up the church v. 23.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The self, the mind, and the soul-life are the main gates through which Satan comes forth to attack and damage the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>23-26.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The building up of the church depends on the shutting up of the gates of Hades through the exercise of three keys Matt 16:24-26: We need to learn to exercise the key of denying the self v. 24: The self is the embodiment of Satan; the self is the soul plus the satanic mind, the mind of Satan Gen 3:1-6; Matt 16:22-23: The self is the embodiment of the soul-life, which is expressed through the mind; thus, the self, the soul-life, and the mind are three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Behind these three is Satan, who manipulates the self in order to damage the church v. 23.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The self is the soul declaring independence from God: The Lord does not have regard for what we do; rather, He has regard for our dependence on Him 7:21-23.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The enemy of the Body is the self; because the self is something independent, the self is the greatest problem, the greatest frustration and opposition, to the building up of the Body: 1 We should depend not only on God but also on the Body, on the brothers and sisters Exo 17:11-13; Acts 9:25; 2 Cor 11:33.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 The Lord and the Body are one; hence, if we are dependent on the Body, we are also dependent on the Lord, and if we are independent of the Body, we are spontaneously independent of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 When we are dependent, the self is gone, and instead of the self, we have the Lord s presence and are full of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4 If we exercise the key of denying the self to lock up the self, it would be impossible for us to be offended cf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Luke 23:34; Acts 7:60.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>5 Only when the self has been utterly dealt with by the cross are we able to touch the reality of the Body of Christ and come to know the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to learn to exercise the key of taking up the cross Matt 16:24: To take up the cross simply means to take up the will of God; the cross is God s will cf.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>26:39: The Lord Jesus was willing to be crucified so that through His death, His life might be released to produce and build up the church John 12:24; 2 Cor 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The cross was a great suffering to the Lord, but He cared not for the suffering but for the fulfillment of God s purpose Heb 12:2; Col 1:24.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let him...take up his cross Matt 16:24 means that we are not forced to bear the cross but that we willingly take it up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The one church is God s will, and every brother and sister in the church is God s will; thus, to bear the cross is to bear the church and to bear all of the saints that we would have the genuine oneness John 17:21-23; Eph 4:3, 13; 1 Cor 1:10; Phil 2:2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to remain on the cross, keeping our old man under the termination of the cross day by day Luke 14:27; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20; Phil 3:10; 1 Cor 15:31.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to learn to exercise the key of losing the soul-life Matt 16:25: To save the soul-life is to please the self by allowing the soul to have its enjoyment; to lose the soul-life is to lose the enjoyment of the soul: Receiving God into man s spirit and expressing God through the soul should be man s joy and amusement cf.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Neh 8:10; Rom 14:17.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus lost the enjoyment of His soul in this age so that He might find His soul-life in the coming age John 10:11; Isa 53:12 ; we must do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we save our soul-life in this age, we will lose it in the coming age, but if we lose our soul-life in this age, we will find it in the coming age Matt 16:25.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to love the Lord Jesus and to hate and deny our soul-life, not loving our soul-life even unto death 1 Cor 16:22; 2:9; Luke 14:26; 9:23; Rev 12:11.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are willing to lose all our present soulish enjoyment for the Lord s sake, for the sake of the church, and for the sake of all the saints, others will be nourished by us and will be built up through us; this is not a suffering but a joy Heb 12:2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The kingdom reward of sharing the King s joy in ruling over the earth in the manifestation of the kingdom depends upon whether or not we save our soul-life in this age or lose it Matt 16:25-28; 25:21, 23.</S>
