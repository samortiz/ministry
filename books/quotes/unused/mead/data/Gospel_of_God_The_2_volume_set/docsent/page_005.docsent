   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I can compare the two in this way:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sin, according to the Scriptures, is said to be in the flesh; whereas sins are in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sin is a principle in us; it is a principle of the life we have.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sins are acts committed by us; they are acts in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sin is a law in the members.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sins are transgressions that we commit; they are activities and real acts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sin is related to our being; sins are related to our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin is what we are; sins are what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sin is in the realm of our life; sins are in the realm of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sin is related to the power of the life we possess; sins are related to the power of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A person is governed by the sin in his natural life, but he is condemned in his conscience by the sins committed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sin is something considered as a whole; sins are something considered case by case.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sin is inside man; sins are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sin requires our being made free; sins require our being forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sin is related to sanctification; sins are related to justification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sin is a matter of overcoming; sins are a matter of having peace in one's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sin is in man's nature; sins are in man's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Figuratively speaking, sin is like a tree, and sins are like the fruit of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can make this matter clear with a simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In preaching the gospel, we often compare the sinner to a debtor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all realize that to be a debtor is not a pleasant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we must remember that it is one thing for a man to have debts; it is another thing for a man to have a disposition for incurring debts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person who borrows again and again is not that concerned about using others' money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible says that Christians should not be debtors Rom 13:8 ; they should not borrow from others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A person with a borrowing disposition may borrow two or three hundred dollars from someone today, then two or three thousand dollars from someone else tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if he is unable to pay back his debts, and his relatives or friends have to pay back the money for him, after a few days he will begin to consider borrowing again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This shows that to borrow is one thing, but to have a borrowing disposition is another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sins that the Bible describes are like the outward debts, while sin is like the inward habit and disposition; it is like the mind that is inclined to borrow easily.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person with such a mind will not stop borrowing just because someone else has paid his debts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, he may borrow even more because others are now paying his debts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why God is dealing not just with the record of sins, but also with the inclination toward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can see that it is important to deal with the sins, but it is equally important to deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only when we see both of these aspects can our understanding of our salvation be complete.</S>
