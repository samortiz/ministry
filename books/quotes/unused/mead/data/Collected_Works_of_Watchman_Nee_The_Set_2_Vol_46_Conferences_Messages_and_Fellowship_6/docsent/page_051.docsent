   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ROMANS 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul is very strong in verse 4.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Who are you?" he asks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Greek the pronoun "you" is emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In effect Paul is saying, "What authority do you have to judge another person's servant?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are not his master."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Paul, we are not merely judging our brother when we judge another believer, we are judging the Lord's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is responsible to the Lord alone, not to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are very presumptuous if we take such matters into our hands, playing the role of a pope and seeking to regulate all the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Remember that Paul was not arguing for vegetarianism at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His reasoning was simply, "Do not meddle with the Lord's business; leave it to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God has been able to open your eyes, can He not open the eyes of others?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Leave them to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You must be patient with others just as the Lord has been patient with you."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"The Lord is able to make him stand" v. 4 . We should trust God and show our trust in Him by leaving the situation in His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as we believe in the Holy Spirit in us, we should believe in the Holy Spirit in our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need not try to act like the lord of all the saints and seek to put them right, as though God could not care for His church without us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 5 says, "Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Should we insist that the Lord's Day be kept?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Should we write a book and attack the Seventh-day Adventists in our midst?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Should we not do something about this?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Will not the unity of the church be endangered if we do not take things in hand?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was not Paul's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to him, we have no business meddling with thoughts of others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our business is to be clear in our own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We always try to get order by rules and regulations, but Paul did not try to regulate things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not put the emphasis on things, but on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 6 the phrase "to the Lord" is important.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a vegetarian sought fellowship with me, I should ask, "Do you refrain from eating meat because it is an idea of yours, or do you do it to please the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he said, "To please the Lord," then I should reply, "If you can serve the Lord better this way, praise His name; go ahead."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must always seek to stress the central point of Christianity, that is, that those who live should live to the Lord and those who die should die to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Wherever we see that the central point is right, we should praise the Lord and not stress externalities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should never lay emphasis on the technical side of Christianity, but always on the fundamental matter of doing everything "to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must never seek to lead those who differ from us to think and act as we do, but simply seek to lead them closer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The chief point is not whether we eat meat, but whether we are living to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must help the saints see their responsibility to the Lord alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If their relationship with Him is right, everything else will adjust itself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Alas! many are not seeking to lead others to a closer relationship with the Lord, but to a closer conformity to certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are working for outward correctness; this is Pharisaism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Pharisees had much in the way of outward form and outward correctness, but they had no relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if we make alterations and adjustments and eventually reach a point of perfect correctness in outward things, nothing has been gained in God's sight unless our relationship with Him is right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Augustine said, "In things essential, unity, in non-essentials, liberty, in all things, charity."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We naturally want everyone to be like us, but if others differ, this is our opportunity to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we make the Lord the center of life, even if there is some divergence in external matters, everything else will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>David went into the tabernacle and ate the showbread, the penalty for which was death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But it did not matter because David was for the Lord; his heart was right toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must continually bear in mind that the central point of Christianity is the lordship of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If Jesus is your Lord and Jesus is my Lord, then everything will be all right between us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The whole question is this: "Is the Lord the center of all in your life and mine?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 8 repeats the phrase "to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not want to lead our brothers to a point of perfect outward correctness, but to the point of living "to the Lord" and dying "to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This point should be repeatedly emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a person comes to me and argues strongly against baptism by immersion, I should not argue with him, but obey Paul's injunction in verse 1 and "receive him , but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his considerations."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This does not mean that I should keep silent, but that I should only ask, "Are you living to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do you think that by not being baptized you are glorifying Him, or do you have a controversy with Him over the matter?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are you resisting Him by not being immersed, or are you doing it to please Him?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I only care whether your relationship with the Lord is right."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you are not immersed, then I can ask, "Are you not immersed out of fear of man or to please the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you are immersed, then I can ask, "Are you immersed to please man or to please the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not want to stress technical correctness but spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Of course, we want to be technically correct as well because we want to serve the Lord as those who are "approved to God" 2 Tim 2:15 .</S>
