   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Visions and Dreams</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among all the churches today, many are seeking visions and dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some have asked me if I believe in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My answer is that I am not opposed to the visions and dreams themselves; I myself also have experienced these before.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes visions and dreams can be very helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, my question is where do the visions and dreams come from?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Are they from God or not?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times when someone testifies in a meeting concerning a vision he has seen, many others begin to talk about their visions as well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the end the whole meeting becomes occupied with visions and dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a fact, and I have seen many cases.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This happens because, after hearing about the visions of others, some begin to pray and ask God for the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they do not have the same experience, they fast and pray for several nights continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their bodies become weak and their minds become blank.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have no will to resist anything, and under these conditions they receive the so-called visions or dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is true that they have received visions, but the question is how they received these visions and whether or not they have received something from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of pursuit with blank minds and passive wills is not according to the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is simply a kind of self-hypnosis.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people are good at dreams and the interpretation of dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, their interpretations are too ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have a friend who is a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After he believed in the Lord, he had a great many dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time I met him, he told me his dreams and his interpretations of them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He dreamt almost every night, sometimes even three or four dreams a night.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What was the reason for such dreams?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you think that God intended to give him all those dreams?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I know that he daydreamed very much; perhaps this was the reason he dreamed so much at night.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was surprising that even though he was an intelligent doctor, his thoughts were so confused.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In his mind he was drawing pictures day and night; he could not control his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What he daydreamed during the day, he dreamed during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I frankly advised him that if he did not reject his dreams, he would be deceived and not grow spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later he improved a little.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows us that many dreams are not from God but are from men's malfunctioning minds and wandering thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Baptism of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another condition, which I call "electric shocks," claims to convey power to some people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It causes them to shake just as if they have been shocked by electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They feel a kind of burning within and make strange noises with their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their hands and feet make all kinds of strange gestures.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what some call "the baptism of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am not against all these.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet remember that what can be done in the spirit can be done in the soul; but what comes from the soul has the goal to deceive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The soul deceives men by telling them that these things are from the spirit and from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we have to differentiate what is from the soul and what is from the spirit, so that we will not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These soulish practices are similar to the way men seek after visions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to have these experiences, people fast and pray all night.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, their bodies become weak, they lose all resistance in their will, and they receive the so-called baptism of the Holy Spirit which makes them shake and tremble.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many people like to have happy or strangely exciting feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They pray earnestly by fasting or for the whole night, in hope of receiving the so-called baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is in reality a kind of self-hypnosis.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They continue to practice these things until they sense some feelings within them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is God really filling up their hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I cannot believe that they have received something that is true because they are not practicing according to the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should, on the one hand, know God and how He thinks about these things, and we should, on the other hand, consider if these things are from God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many believers think that everything is from God, and they accept it all.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result, they are deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Other believers think that it is very difficult to distinguish what is from God and what is not.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a result, they reject everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should differentiate what is from God and what is not.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Anything that is from God, we will accept, and anything that is not from God, no matter how good, we should reject.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should remember that all of Satan's works are done through the power of man's soul, and we must avoid them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>EXAMINING THE SOURCE</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some seek visions.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some say they have seen lights or a flame, while others say they have had dreams or have felt an electric shock.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After they testify this way, others begin to have similar experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am not against these things in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I merely ask, Where do these things come from?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Are they from the soul, or are they from the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We ought to remember that everything that can be done in the spirit can also be done in the soul; the only difference between them is that the soulish things are a counterfeit of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do not trace the source of these things, we will be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The most important thing is to not deny the existence of these things, but to ask if these things are from the soul or the spirit.</S>
