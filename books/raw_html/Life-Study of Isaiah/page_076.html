<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT<br>OVER THE DRUNKARDS OF EPHRAIM<br>(REPRESENTING THE NORTHERN KINGDOM OF ISRAEL)<br>ISSUING IN JEHOVAH'S RESTORATION<br>AND USHERING IN THE TRUSTWORTHY CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah's Punishment<br>over Ephraim's Drunkards</H2><P>In 28:1-4, 7-15, and 17-29 we have Jehovah's punishment over Ephraim's drunkards.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Drunkards' Indulgence in Drinking</H2><P>The drunkards reel with wine and stagger from liquor (v. 7a). The priest and the prophet stagger from liquor; they are swallowed up with wine, and they reel in their visions and totter in their judgments (v. 7b). All the tables are full of vomit and filth; no place is clean (v. 8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah's Punishment</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Woe Being to the Proud<br>Crown of the Drunkards of Ephraim<br>and to the Fading Flower of Its Glorious Beauty</H2><P>Isaiah 28:1 says, "Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim/And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, / Which is at the head of the fat valley of those who are overcome by wine." Verse 2 tells us that the Lord has someone who is strong and mighty, as a hailstorm and a tempest of destruction, as a storm of mighty overflowing waters. I believe that this someone was first the king of Assyria and then the king of Babylon. The proud crown will be trodden under foot; and the fading flower, like the first-ripe fig before the summer, will be swallowed up by one who sees it (vv. 3-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Bothering Them by the Gentile</H2>
