   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CONTRAST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For us to appreciate the Lord's recovery, it is helpful to know what the background was.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such a contrast will help us to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The background of the Lord's recovery is Christianity, whose characteristics are confusion and division.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These characteristics first appeared at Babel Gen 11:1-9 or Babylon Gk. for Babel , whose very name means confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why in the book of Revelation the Lord called today's Christendom Babylon the great 17:5; 18:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 12:12 tells us what the Lord would have instead of the confusion and division.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"One" stands out here in contrast to division and "Christ" in contrast to confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what the Lord's recovery is: an answer to confusion and division.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>EARLY CHURCH HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By reading the New Testament you can see that even in the time of the Apostle Paul around A.D. 60-70 confusion had begun to creep in. On the day of Pentecost there was nothing but Christ in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But before long, the subtle serpent, Satan, introduced Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Religion stands at the top of human culture, and among the religions none can exceed Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It teaches the worship of God, morality, ethics, proper social relations, and good human living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only something attractive like this could have gained an entrance into the church, which is on the highest level.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I had some dollar bills and someone wanted to add a counterfeit, he would not add just any piece of paper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The counterfeit would not be taken unless it resembled the dollar bills in every respect; it would need an expert to discern that it was false.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was because Judaism seemed so close to Christianity that it was able to creep in. Even today historians say that Christianity is the offspring of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul also had to contend with Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Philosophy ranks next to religion, and Greek philosophy was the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the end of the first century, then, the so-called church had within it Christ, Judaism, and Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Galatians was written to deal with Judaism; Colossians, to deal with philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The third source of confusion made its appearance in the second century.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the satanic snare of Christology, the study of Christ's person, undertaken by the so-called church fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From the studies of these great, fundamental Christian teachers arose various schools regarding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One said that Christ was not God till after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another said that Christ was God but not a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The result of these Christological studies, on such a seemingly good scriptural topic, was actual division, no longer just confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There seemed no way to solve the problem till Constantine the Great summoned the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As emperor he utilized Christianity to appease the warring factions within the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This worldly Constantine presided over that Council which resolved the theological differences and produced the Nicene Creed, accepted by both Catholics and Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Darkness followed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Several centuries were even called the Dark Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the reformation under Martin Luther brought in the truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regrettably, it also brought in the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From this time on, there was the Church of England Anglican or Episcopalian , the Church of Germany Lutheran , and a national church in most of the northern European countries.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not too long after these were formed, private churches, like the Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist, came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now here we are in the twentieth century, surrounded, even in this city, by all these divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By the Lord's mercy we are in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not clearly see what this means, we may become a continuation or extension of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If that is all we are, it is meaningless for us to continue to meet; we may as well go back and join them.</S>
