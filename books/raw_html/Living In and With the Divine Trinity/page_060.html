<P>Many Christians do not think about God's move in this way. Some in the Pentecostal movement like to shout, cry out, and even jump. They like a big, outward display, but God's inward operating in us does not necessarily have such an outward display. The current of electricity in a building is a very good illustration of God's operating. When we enter into the building, it may seem that nothing is working there because everything is quiet. However, there is an operating going on, and this quiet operating is vigorous. The operating of the electricity in the building enables all the appliances, machines, and devices in the building to move and function. If this electricity is switched off, everything in the building is shut down. The more I have experienced God throughout the years, the more I realize that God's move within us is a very quiet, fine operation. He operates in us finely and quietly.</P><P>Although we are Christians, it may seem that we have nothing within us. We may wonder at times what the difference is between us and the unbelievers. The truth concerning regeneration and transformation is very high and great. Even though we have been regenerated and are being transformed, we may feel like common persons. Actually, however, God is operating in us. Although a big building is under the operation of electricity, this operation is quiet and calm. We need to see that God's operating in us is a miraculous normality. It is altogether normal, yet altogether miraculous.</P><P>D.L. Moody said that the greatest miracle in the universe is regeneration. I agree with this. No miracle is greater than regeneration. Regeneration means that we have the divine life in addition to our human life. We have the divine life, but we may not feel that we can see much of the manifestation of this life within us. We may feel that others who are not regenerated are actually better than we are. Even though we are regenerated, we may lose our temper again and again. However, our being better or worse than others is an outward matter. If we are regenerated, we have the inner realization that something is within us. This "something" is the living and moving God who is now operating in us. Whether a person is outwardly bad or good may be according to his natural birth. What matters is not whether we are good or bad according to our natural constitution, but the fact that we have received the operating God. God is now operating in us.</P><P>Paul used great words in the book of Philippians to speak of the experience of Christ. He said that he magnified Christ. To magnify is to show or declare great (without limitation), to exalt, and to extol. Paul speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and he says that for him to live is Christ. At the end of Philippians, Paul said, "All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar's household" (4:22). Caesar's household comprised all who were attached to the palace of Nero. Some of these were converted through contact with Paul and became believers in Christ in Rome. No doubt, some in Caesar's household became Christians because they saw Christ in Paul. The majority, however, did not see Christ in Paul. Surely Christ was with Paul all the time, but many did not see. Seeing Christ in such a way depends upon the Lord's mercy. It depends upon whether God has chosen or predestinated someone. Paul magnified Christ before everyone, but not everyone saw this magnification. This was because they did not receive the Lord's mercy. They were not chosen or predestinated. God's operating in us is not outwardly spectacular, but in a spiritual sense it is a great matter. If we have the spiritual discernment, the spiritual realizing power, we can see that all the things in the book of Philippians related to God's operating in us are great.</P>
