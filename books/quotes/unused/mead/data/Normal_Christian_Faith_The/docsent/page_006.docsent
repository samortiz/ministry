   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EVIDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some will immediately step back and say, "I have never said that I know there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One can never tell whether there is a God or not."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Well, if you cannot give a conclusion, I will ask witnesses whom I consider trustworthy to present arguments to you and prove the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Again let me say this, you are the judge, and I am the prosecutor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am presenting only the evidence before you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Decide for yourself if there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, look at nature, the world that is before our eyes and every phenomenon in it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all know that scientific knowledge is the rational explanation of natural phenomena.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, there is an observed drop in the temperature of a patient.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The drop in temperature is a phenomenon, and the explanation for it is scientific knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When an apple falls from the tree, it is a phenomenon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why does an apple not fly into the air?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The explanation for this phenomenon constitutes knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A man with knowledge is a man who has the proper explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ONLY TWO EXPLANATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The universe displays countless phenomena of diverse forms, colors, shapes, and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot fail to notice these phenomena before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The explanation for all these phenomena is known as knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All thoughtful persons have only two explanations as far as the origin of the universe is concerned; there is no third explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to take one or the other of them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What are these two explanations?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first says that the universe came into being through natural evolution and self-interaction; the second attributes its origin to a personified Being with intellect and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are the only two explanations presented by all philosophers of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is not a third one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where did the universe come from?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Did it come into existence by itself or through chance?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Or was it designed by the One from whom we derive the concept of God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to think and then make a decision about it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything that is by chance has certain characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would suggest you list all of these in a detailed way, the more the better, and then compare all the phenomena of the universe with your list.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Alongside of this make another list of the characteristics which, in your opinion, would be prominent if the universe were created by an intelligent Being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now by a simple comparison of nature with your two lists, it will be easy to draw a reasonable conclusion.</S>
