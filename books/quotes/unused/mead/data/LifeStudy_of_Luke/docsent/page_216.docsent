   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVENTY-THREE THE MAN-SAVIOR S RESURRECTION 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-20; 12:24b; 1 Pet 1:3; Eph 1:20-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This message is the continuation of the foregoing message in which we began to consider the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first matter we saw relating to this subjective aspect is that the Man-Savior s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into His believers 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The resurrection of the Man-Savior was a process.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This process began immediately after the Lord s birth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not think, therefore, that His resurrection began on the third day after His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we consider the New Testament thoroughly, we shall realize that resurrection begins with death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the thirty-three and a half years of the Lord s human living on earth, He experienced death death to Himself and to all things other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the life He lived was a life under death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Luke 12:50 the Man-Savior indicated that He was very constrained and desired to be released: I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word translated pressed may also be rendered constrained.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Man-Savior was constrained in His flesh, which He had put on through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, He needed to die, to be baptized in physical death, so that His unlimited and infinite divine being with His divine life might be released from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The point here is that the Lord lived a life under death to Himself and that this kind of living is related to the process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As an illustration of the fact that resurrection begins with death, let us consider once again the Lord s word concerning Himself as a grain of wheat: Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a grain of wheat is sown into the earth, it dies there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But while it is dying, it is also growing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The strange thing is this: if the grain of wheat does not die, it will not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose a grain of wheat is placed on a table and left there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That grain of wheat will not die, and also it will not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for a grain of wheat to grow, it must be put in the ground to die.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It grows by the way of dying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without dying, a grain of wheat will never grow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we need to see that the resurrection of a grain of wheat does not begin when the wheat sprouts out from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When a grain of wheat sprouts in this way, someone may say, Look!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can see the resurrection of the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not wrong to say that the sprouting of a wheat grain is a matter of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the point we are making here is that the resurrection of a grain of wheat does not begin with the sprouting of the grain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, its resurrection begins much earlier than this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The resurrection of a grain of wheat begins with the death of the grain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From the illustration of the dying and growing of a grain of wheat we can see that while Christ was dying, He was resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When did Christ s resurrection begin?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not say that it began three days after His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the picture of a grain of wheat dying and growing, Christ s resurrection began while He was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He likened Himself to a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die so that many grains might be brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus, like the grain of wheat, was growing, sprouting, resurrecting, even while He was dying.</S>
