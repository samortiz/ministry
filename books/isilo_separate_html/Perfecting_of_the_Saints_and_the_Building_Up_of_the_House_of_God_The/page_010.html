ALL THE BELIEVERS BEING PRIESTS</h2>
<p>Many portions in the Bible show that the church must be built up. However, no portion speaks of the building up of the church as clearly as Ephesians 4. If Matthew 16 was the only portion that spoke of the building of the church, we would think that the church is built directly by the Lord Jesus, because in verse 18 the Lord said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; This verse says that the Lord builds up the church.</p>
<p>Someone who opposed the Lord&rsquo;s recovery said, &ldquo;Some people claim that they will go and build the church in every place. Can human beings build the church? Of course not, the church is built by the Lord Jesus. The Lord explicitly said that He will build His church upon the rock.&rdquo; This is what the Gospel of Matthew says. However, the facts and the truth further revealed in the Bible prove that the Lord Jesus does not build the church directly.</p>
<p>The New Testament contains Matthew 16 and also Ephesians 4. Ephesians 4 reveals that after the Lord ascended to the height, He gave gifts to the Body. These gifts are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Therefore, the Lord does not build the church directly; rather, He builds the church in and through these gifts. There is not one local church that is built directly by the Lord Himself. For the past two thousand years every local church was built by the Lord through men.</p>
<p>Verses 8, 11, and 12 in Ephesians 4 reveal how the church is built. The Lord ascended to the height and received gifts. Then He gave these gifts to His Body, and finally the gifts work to perfect the saints. The word <em>perfect</em> implies taking material that has no function and making it into something useful. Therefore, to perfect the saints means to make the saints useful vessels. The apostles and the other gifts perfect the saints and thereby make them functioning members. The saints who formerly could not function as elders can function as elders after they are perfected by the gifts. Similarly, saints who could not function as deacons can be deacons after they are perfected by the gifts. The saints, who formerly did not manifest their ministry, their function, or their gift, manifest their function after they are perfected. This is the work carried out by the apostles and other gifts in various places. The perfected saints become proper, useful material; hence, they can participate in the work of the ministry. The result is that the church is built up. This is how the church builds itself up.</p>
<p>Three persons participate in the work of building up the church: the Lord Jesus, the gifts, and the perfected saints. The Lord does not build the church directly; neither does He want the gifts, such as the apostles, to build directly. The Lord gave the gifts to the church for the perfecting of the saints. Then the saints who do not function can be perfected to become functioning vessels. When the perfected saints fulfill their function, the church is spontaneously built up. The church is built up directly by the perfected saints.</p>
<p>Let us consider the building of the church as presented in the entire divine revelation. According to God&rsquo;s ordination the believers in the early church practiced the universal priesthood (Rev. 1:6; 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). In other words, all the believers served God as priests. However, the church deviated from this practice, and the service of God fell into the hands of a small number of believers known as the clergy. Thus, the priestly system of the Old Testament was brought into the church. From that time onward only a few saints in the church served God; most of the saints did not serve God. This resulted in the formation of two classes&mdash;the clergy and the laity. This was also the beginning of the priestly system in the Catholic Church. The Protestant churches may be reformed in name, but they have retained the same system of service adopted by the Catholic Church. The state churches call it the clerical system, and the independent churches call it the pastoral system. Some people even say that we have a &ldquo;system of workers.&rdquo; Any such system is according to one principle; that is, only a small number of believers serve, while the majority of the believers do not serve.</p>
<p>The Bible says that all believers should serve God as priests, but the church has practiced two kinds of service. In the service practiced by the initial church, all believers were priests. This kind of service is according to God&rsquo;s original intention (Exo. 19:6), the &ldquo;pattern, which was shown to you in the mountain&rdquo; (25:40; Heb. 8:5). In the other kind of service a small number of believers serve, and the majority do not serve. This is the deviated way, not the original way. This way is derived from man&rsquo;s ideas; it is not according to God&rsquo;s original intention. Hence, if we want to serve according to God&rsquo;s original pattern, the building up of the church must involve all the saints. If we serve according to the deviated way found in Christianity, only a few believers can participate in the building, whereas the majority of the believers cannot participate in the building.</p>
<p>The service in Christianity has deviated because one or two pastors are in charge of a congregation, or one or two preachers are assigned to give sermons. The saints in these congregations only attend the services. When the pastor or the preacher leaves, all activities stop. This situation proves that the service is carried out by a few believers, not by all the believers. This also proves that the building is in the hands of a few believers. In other words, a few saints replace the rest of the saints in the building work. As a result, when the small group of believers leave, the building stops, and the service to God also stops. This is a great mistake.</p>
<p>In every locality we must pay attention to the building up of the church. The churches need to be built up by the growth of life. However, as we pay attention to the building up of the church, we must understand that no worker can build up the church directly. Every worker builds up the church indirectly by perfecting the saints. When we work in a place, our primary work should not be to build up the church directly. Our primary work should be to perfect the saints. The direct building up of the church should be by the perfected saints, not by us. After we labor in a place, we should be able to say that instead of building up the church directly, we have perfected a group of saints who can now fulfill their responsibility and manifest their function. When we leave, the saints we have perfected will manifest their function in a stronger way. This is the way to build up the church. This is entirely different from what is practiced in Christianity.</p>
<p>In Christianity there must be a pastor or a preacher in order to have Christian activities. As soon as the pastor or the preacher leaves, the activities stop, because no one can give the sermon. If the co-workers work according to this principle, we have made a serious mistake. It is wrong for us to build up a church directly, because the building will stop when we leave. The proper situation is for us to perfect the saints. The longer we stay in one place, the more we should be able to perfect others. Eventually, the saints are perfected. After they are perfected, the saints who were idle and did not function much become useful. Formerly, these saints could not manifest their gift and their function. But after they are perfected, they manifest and exercise their function. The saints who could not supply others in the meetings are able to function and supply others after they are perfected.</p>
<p>After we labor in a place, there should be a number of perfected saints. Then the building up of the church will not stop when we leave; instead, it will be more active. This is the proper service, and this is the way that the Lord builds up the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
