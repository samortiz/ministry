   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT CONVERTING THE MESSAGES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO TEACHING MATERIAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The basis and principle for selecting material are to supply people with life, to solve their problems, and to generate a feeling of need within them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is how material should be selected for the young people s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although our messages may be educational, we should avoid turning them into a course of instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, the so-called Sunday school has become a course for fifty-two topics of study.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A child may participate in all these lessons without gaining much inwardly related to spirituality, the content of the gospel, and the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, I attended a Christian elementary school and was one of the top students in Sunday school.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I even served as a teacher s assistant in Sunday school.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I did not gain anything from the Sunday school.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, I said that we should drop the word school from the children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not want a Sunday school; we simply want children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not give children the concept that the children s meeting is a course of study, and that they are required to recite and memorize.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They should feel that they are touched and inwardly supplied when they come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, our children s meetings should focus on making these children godly young people who live before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they can be impressed with matters concerning how to be a proper human being, fearing God, or salvation, it will be a help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a children s meeting in Manila, the serving ones wanted to tell the story of Samson and Delilah because several movie houses in Manila were showing the love story of Samson and Delilah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a basic mistake in selecting material.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This way is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not randomly speak to children about Samuel today, David tomorrow, Saul the following day, and then Peter, giving them outlines to memorize and then testing them on the material.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is futile, and it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to touch their feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, the children s meetings that D. L. Moody conducted looked like Sunday school but were not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moody was burdened for people s souls.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One time he invited a little girl to attend his Sunday school.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The girl promised to come but did not show up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Several days later Moody saw her on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As soon as she saw Moody, the girl ran into a tavern and hid under a bed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moody ran after her and pulled her out from under the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After this, the little girl attended his Sunday school.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are as burdened as Moody, we will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to pay attention to this matter; all the other things are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not give lessons like elementary school teachers, who divide the children into groups and conduct classes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not give lessons to children and begin the class by asking, What was the lesson last week?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Right; it was on David.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who is David?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The children reply, David was a person who is after God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>David was a king for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We then say, Very good, you get one hundred percent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If our children s meetings are like this, we are doing a work of death, which should be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The children s meeting in Taipei still has this flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The material we use should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We might speak to the children about loving their brothers and sisters, about God s love, and how God created men with a loving heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not need to speak about spiritual love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should give them the feeling that the love within them comes from God and that they should love their brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They would then feel guilty if they do not love their brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the next meeting we can speak about honoring our parents, asking them to obey their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This speaking is living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that we should not use Bible stories.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can use a story in the Bible to illustrate loving our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not a course of study, but a living application.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This should also be applied to the work with the young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who serve the young saints must understand that we should not depend on edifying meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we depend on edifying meetings, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From 1946 to 1948 there were no young people s meetings in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We did not even have such a term.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the time the care for young people was from a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The saints shepherded them individually.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is a pity that our college conferences are conducted like classes teaching a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All of those who speak for the Lord must learn that our speaking should edify without being like a class.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are not conducting classes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is dead, and it will not enliven people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who speak must receive a burden to labor on the young people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Through prayer and other ways we should shepherd them so that the Lord can gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not always teach them what Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Abraham did.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They may memorize all this one week and forget it the next week.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Teaching them in this way is futile.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should touch their feeling in a way that they will never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Mental exercise and recitation are but dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is no need to pay much attention to such things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Furthermore, we should not be concerned about how many are in attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Instead, we should endeavor to learn some living lessons, have living experiences, and receive a living burden to labor on the young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should do a work of kindling the fire in them that would cause them to kindle the fire in others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only this kind of work is a living work.</S>
