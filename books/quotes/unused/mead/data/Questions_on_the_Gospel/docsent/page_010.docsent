   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION SIX CONCERNING LEVITICUS 4:1-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Leviticus 4:1-7, why was the blood of the sin offering brought to the tabernacle of the congregation and sprinkled seven times before the veil of the sanctuary before God; according to the law of the cleansing of the lepers in Leviticus 14:1-7, the blood was sprinkled upon the lepers seven times?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, let us pay attention to one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the entire Bible, who is the One that requires the blood?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why does God require the blood?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the people of Israel sinned, why did God not forgive them through His mercy?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God had done this, He would have been unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Could the publican simply ask God to grant mercy and pity him?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No. What he actually said to God was, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner" Luke 18:13 . Sin must be judged and punished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only when you come before God with the blood can He forgive you, for without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some pray, "O God, if You want to forgive, please forgive; if it is Your will to forgive, please forgive."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But forgiveness is not a question of whether or not God wants to forgive; neither is it a question of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although God is merciful and willing to be gracious, and although it is His will to willingly forgive us, He cannot forgive without the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God can only forgive when there is the blood because He is a righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Bringing the blood before God and sprinkling it seven times satisfies the righteous requirement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then God can forgive the sins of man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When there is a sin, there must be the blood; this is the righteous requirement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose someone committed a murder, went to the chief justice of the court, and pleaded for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The chief justice could pity him and forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later, a second and third person could commit the same crime and also plead for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they were also forgiven, there would be chaos because murderers could be freed simply by pleading for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone would be able to kill.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If there were no punishment for the sins, this would be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The requirement of the law of God is that whoever has sinned must die blood must be shed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus has shed His precious blood; this has satisfied the requirement of God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we are saved not only because God has grace but even more because God has righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blood of the sin offering must be brought before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the blood, God could not forgive even if He wanted to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God cannot forgive a "bloodless" sinner because of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to understand the meaning of the sprinkling of the blood upon the leper seven times, we need to notice that Leviticus 14:1 through 7 does not say that the leper was healed after the blood was sprinkled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, it says that after the leper was healed, the blood was sprinkled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the leper was healed, he was only cleansed before men; in order for him to be reckoned as cleansed before God, there had to be the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's requirement is the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After a leper is healed, he is acceptable before men; but without the blood, he is still unclean before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Matthew 8:1-4, when the Lord Jesus healed the leper, He also commanded him to offer the gift that Moses charged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time, the Lord was not yet crucified on the cross, so He told him to do according to the Old Testament ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the Lord helped him to be cleansed before men, he was not yet cleansed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, he needed the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This shows that no matter how excellently one behaves or how moral one is, if he does not have the blood, he is still unclean before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The blood satisfies God's requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The blood is shed not only to cleanse our conscience but even more to fulfill the requirement of God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since we are sinners, we cannot be saved without the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not saved because we are worthy but because the Lord has shed His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are accepted by God because of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We dare to draw near to God because of the effectiveness of the blood which the Lord Jesus shed, not because of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the blood satisfies God and causes Him to reckon us as cleansed.</S>
