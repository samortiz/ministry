The feeding of the lambs is for nourishing, that is, for cherishing the babes. The perfecting of the saints is for teaching, that is, for instructing people in the truth. Prophesying for God is for building, that is, for the building up of the church.</P><P>Speaking may be considered the greatest ability or skill. We may speak the same word, yet you may speak it in one way and I in another way. Hence, there needs to be much consideration in this matter. In the New Testament, there is one chapter, 1 Corinthians 14, that is altogether concerned with the matter of prophesying. The Greek word that is rendered prophesy in this chapter may also be rendered predict. However, whichever way we may render it, both prophesying and predicting are not to speak for ourselves but to speak for God. We must keep this point firmly in mind. When we prophesy in the church, we speak for God and not for ourselves. God is our source; He is the word that we speak. When we prophesy for God, we speak for God, speak forth God, and speak God into people to dispense God to them.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul spoke altogether about prophesying. He highly exalted prophesying and greatly belittled speaking in tongues. He said, "Greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up" (1 Cor. 14:5). He also said, "But in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue" (1 Cor. 14:19). For this reason, he encouraged us again and again to prophesy for God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
