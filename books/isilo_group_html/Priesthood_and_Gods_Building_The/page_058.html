<h1 class="title">EXERCISING<br />
TO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD<br />
AND TO FUNCTION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENING THE SAINTS&rsquo; KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF THE LORD AND THE FATHER</h2>
<p>When we meet in the smaller &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; we should spend time to strengthen the saints&rsquo; knowledge of the Lord and the Father. We should use the first three weeks to fellowship about knowing the Lord and the fourth week to focus on knowing the Father. There are many crucial points related to knowing the Lord, but in the first year we should present only a brief outline. More details can be added in subsequent years. For example, there are fine points concerning the Lord being the seed of a woman, being Emmanuel, and being born of a woman. If we focus on these additional points in a gradual way, the brothers and sisters will be greatly helped to know the Lord. There are not as many crucial points related to the Father, so we do not need to devote as much time for fellowship concerning them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGESTING THE MESSAGES AND<br />
INCREASING THE MUTUAL FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>Meeting in small &ldquo;classes&rdquo; has numerous advantages. For example, in the past the saints did not have the time to digest the message that was given in a meeting. Consequently, the message did not have much impact. Now that we are meeting in small groups, the saints can pray and digest the message, and this will leave a solid impression in their spirit.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that the brothers and sisters have more contact with one another. In the past, the saints came to the meeting to listen to messages or to break the bread, and even though the number in a district was small, there was little opportunity for mutual fellowship. In our pursuing in the small &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; there is more contact between the saints, and this contact is more spontaneous and practical. In short, the saints are receiving much spiritual help in this fellowship. We must continue in this way by the Lord&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HELPING THE SAINTS TO SPEAK FOR GOD</h2>
<p>We should use no more than two-thirds or three-fifths of the meeting time for the release of a message, with the remainder of the time being for fellowship among the saints. This is a way for everyone to serve in the church. Without this practice of pursuing in &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; only the speaking brother who gives a message and a small number of brothers and sisters who help in ushering and other practical matters have an opportunity to serve.</p>
<p>Since we began the practice of pursuing and fellowshipping in &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; all the saints are learning how to serve. In particular, after gaining some understanding of the Lord&rsquo;s Word, they have an opportunity to function by ministering the Lord&rsquo;s word in their speaking to one another. In this way, all the saints receive benefit. This is far better than leading the saints to serve in just ushering and cleaning.</p>
<p>If the brothers and sisters in each district receive this kind of leading, they will be able to do the same thing when they are led by the Lord to move to another place. This is a totally different situation from what we have seen in the past. For example, a new believer no longer comes to a meeting just to sit and listen to a message, which only makes him feel as if he has no function. Our concepts are being changed because the saints now see that everyone can speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>There are two categories of speaking among human beings. Everyone has the capacity for the first kind of speaking, which is ordinary speaking. Unless a person is physically dumb, everyone has the capacity for ordinary speech. The second kind of speaking is related to a more formal speaking, especially public speaking to others. Not everyone can do this. These two kinds of speaking can be seen in the spiritual realm. Every child of God can speak some spiritual words, explain a little about the Bible, share something concerning God&rsquo;s grace, utter words of praise to God, or give a brief testimony for the Lord. It is not right if a brother or a sister cannot speak something for the Lord after being saved for a few years; this is equivalent to being spiritually dumb. Every believer should be able to open his mouth to speak for God and to testify for God, even if he does not have the capacity to give a message.</p>
<p>Among God&rsquo;s children, God has appointed some to speak the word. These, however, are not the only ones who can speak, because every child of God is able to speak something. In order to speak, we do not need to ask for a special portion of grace. As long as we stand in our position as a child of God, we can speak for God. If we have received some training and perfecting before the Lord and have some knowledge of spiritual things and some understanding of the Bible, we can also speak for God in the way of ministry. We must change our concept of sitting and waiting for a &ldquo;pastor&rdquo; to give a sermon; this is a concept in Christianity. If we are perfected to speak as children of God, we can bring other saints into this exercise wherever we are or wherever we move to. This will have a far-reaching impact.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
