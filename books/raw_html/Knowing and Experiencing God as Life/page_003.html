        <h2 class="head1">HE WHO EATS THE LORD<br />
LIVING BECAUSE OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>God as life in us is our nourishment, our power. This power is not outward; it supplies us inwardly. John 6:57 says, &ldquo;The living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father.&rdquo; In the original language, the expression <em>because of</em> also has the meaning of &ldquo;by&rdquo; and &ldquo;through.&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus was living on the earth as a man, He lived by God the Father and through God the Father. He did not live independent of the Father. He lived in God, and He let God live in Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, He was a perfect man, yet He did not live by His human life. He was a man in the flesh, but He had no sin. This is what made Him different from other men; everything else about Him was the same as with other men. He had a human life with a human nature. When He lived on the earth, He always put His human life aside instead of living by His human life. He knew that He was sent by the Father to do the Father&rsquo;s work. Hence, the Lord did not work by His own life but by the life of the Father, who was life in Him. He said to His disciples, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works&rdquo; (14:10). This means that He did not live by His human life but by God who lived in Him as the divine life.</p>
<p>The Lord also said, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (6:57). The expression <em>eat the Lord</em> is very particular, but it should be easy for us to comprehend. To eat is to receive into us the things that can nourish and supply us. We eat breakfast in the morning because without the nourishment and supply from the food, we would not have strength for the day. We cannot survive if we do not receive nourishment over a long period of time. We eat because we need the supply. We do not receive a supply from outward empowering or compelling. In order to receive a supply, we need to take in nutrients by digesting and absorbing food. Then the food will become a supply within us. We often do not sense this kind of supply. Having a particular feeling after we eat indicates that we have a problem with our stomach. Otherwise, we will not feel anything after we eat. When our stomach is functioning normally, we automatically receive a supply from the food that we eat without any particular feeling.</p>
<p>Similarly, we often do not sense the Lord&rsquo;s supply within us. Sometimes we pray when we are weak, hoping that a surge of energy will descend upon us to empower us. This may happen occasionally, but it is not a normal situation. The normal situation is that the Lord supplies us within because we daily receive Him into us as food by digesting and absorbing Him. When He is supplying us, we feel normal; we do not have a particular feeling. However, when we are short of Him, we will sense something. This shows how the Lord supplies us.</p>
<p>Eating is something normal. There is nothing special about eating. However, many Christians prefer to have special things. They say that they should have a special experience like the disciples had in Acts 2:1-4, when there was a sound out of heaven, as a rushing violent wind, and tongues of fire. Sometimes we may need a special experience, but it should not be our normal situation. Our regular and normal situation is that the Lord is food for us to eat Him as our nourishment. Eating a meal is very ordinary. Since the day that we were born, we have eaten meals daily. We should not focus our attention on special experiences. The more intimate we are with the Lord, the more normal our situation should be, and our experience of the Lord should also be more ordinary. We may have rich or deep experiences, but our situation should be ordinary, because the Lord gives Himself to us as food without much fanfare or special feelings. It is normal to eat bread or to drink milk. When our experience of the Lord is ordinary and normal, it will also be spontaneous and proper. We should not pursue experiences that are out of the ordinary.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING THE LORD AND LIVING BY HIM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Being in the Spirit and in the Word</h2>
<p>In order to eat the Lord, we must know where He is. If we desire to eat some food, we need to know where it is located. When we want to eat a meal, we should go to the dining table, because the food is put on the dining table. Where should we go when we have the desire to eat the Lord? The Lord is the Word (John 1:1), and He is also the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). Hence, we can say that the Lord is in the Word and also in the Spirit. He is always in His Word and the Spirit. When we use our spirit to contact the Word, the Spirit will touch our spirit. The Spirit and the Word cannot be separated: &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). Whenever His words touch our inner being, they become spirit and life. Not only so, the Spirit has entered into us. Hence, the Lord is in the Word and in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in our spirit. Whenever we want to contact the Lord and take Him into us, we can find Him in a definite place. We can find Him in the Bible and in the Spirit. Whenever we desire to receive the Lord, we need to turn to our spirit and also to open the Bible. This is the reason that we need to pray and to read the Bible daily. To pray is to turn to our spirit, and to read the Bible is to contact the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
