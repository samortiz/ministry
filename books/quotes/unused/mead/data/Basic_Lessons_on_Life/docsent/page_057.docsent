   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In these verses we can see the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, He dispenses Himself into our spirit, and then from our spirit into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we set our mind upon the spirit, the life in the spirit will get into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To set the mind on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, even the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God, God Himself, dwells in us to spread His life, to give His life, to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This dispensing function issues in the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Ephesians 3:14-17 we can also see the dispensing function of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these verses Paul says, "I bow my knees unto the Father..that He would grant you,..to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here the apostle Paul prays to the Father, the saints are strengthened into the inner man through the Spirit, and Christ makes His home in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father receives and answers the prayer, the Spirit strengthens, and then Christ makes His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Triune God functions for the purpose of dispensing Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Christ makes His home in our hearts, that means our whole being will be taken over, possessed, occupied, and filled up with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another portion concerning the dispensing function of the Triune God is in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 1 the Lord said, "I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The husbandman is the source, and the vine is the organism and the embodiment of what the source is, what the source has, and what the source does.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, whatever the Father is, has, and does is altogether embodied in this universal organism, the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The source is the Father, and the organism is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both the source and the organism are made real by the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 26 of the same chapter the Lord said, "But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the Spirit to testify concerning the Son means that He makes the Son real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is made real to us by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 15, Romans 8, and Ephesians 3 are crucial portions of the Word concerning the dispensing function of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seed of this truth is in John 15, and the harvest of this truth is in Romans 8 and Ephesians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These portions not only give us the revelation of the Triune God but also show us how the Divine Trinity functions in a corporate way to dispense Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not for doctrine but for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of us must see the dispensing function of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the first section of John 14 the Lord unveiled to His disciples that He and the Father are one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is in the Father and the Father is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His speaking was the Father's working.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then He went on to unveil that He and the Spirit are also one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is from verse 16 through verse 20.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So in John 14 you have these two main points: first, the Father is embodied in the Son, and second, the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 14:23 says, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is also the dispensing function of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 14 there is the abode, and in chapter fifteen there is the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these portions of the Word give us a clear picture that in the spiritual world there is the dispensing function of the Triune God into us, the tripartite men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also have to read Hebrews 8:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here it says that in the new covenant God has imparted His laws into our mind and inscribed them on our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we do not need anyone to teach us outwardly because inwardly we have the subjective knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all can know God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word for know here is oida, which refers to the subjective knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The dispensing function of the Triune God issues in the sense of life through the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First John 2:27 goes on to speak of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The law of life and the anointing both issue in the sense of life and are both a part of the dispensing function of the Triune God.</S>
