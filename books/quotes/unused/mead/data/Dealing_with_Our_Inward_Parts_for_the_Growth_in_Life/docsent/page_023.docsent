   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INCREASE OF POWER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is also a difference between the growth of life and the increase of power.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Samson was very powerful, but what did he have life or mere power?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes people say that Peter was also powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Often, though, I consider that Peter was not as powerful as Samson.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter was powerful in a different realm, in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Samson had genuine power from God, but that power was not life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot see much life in the record of Samson.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today most Christians do not differentiate power from life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In a sense, someone may even have a kind of spiritual power but still be very short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Power must be for life, but people today mistake power for life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A powerful person may not be full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to differentiate these two.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Power is for life, but power is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regardless of how much increase of power we have, we may still be poor in the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the growth of life there is the need of the work of the cross, but for power in itself there is not such a need.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What then is life?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Again I say, life is Christ Himself, and the real growth of life is the increase and expanding of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can we have the expanding of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no other way but to always open ourselves to the Lord and contact Him, not only once a day but all the time, daily, every day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to open ourselves to Him and let Him come in. Therefore, we should forget about behavior, the form of godliness, zeal in service, knowledge, gifts, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Simply pay attention to one thing, that is, to Christ, to open ourselves to Him, contact Him, breathe Him in, feed on Him, and drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we will have not merely the improvement of behavior but transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will have not merely the form of godliness but the reality of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has the appearance of a precious stone, like jasper, so we too will have the appearance of jasper Rev 4:3; 21:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will be transformed into the very image of God, not in form only but in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then to be sure, the more we feed on Christ and breathe Him in, the more we will be burned and will be burning; we will have the real zeal within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will also have the real knowledge, not the knowledge in the soul but the real knowledge of Christ in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will have the experience rather than mere knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will know Christ not merely by reading and listening but by experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We also will have not the mere manifestation of the gifts but the function of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The function of life comes out of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we feed on the Lord, the more we take Him in, and the more we grow in Him, the more our function in life will come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will have the power in life, the indwelling Christ as the real power, just as 1 Corinthians 1:24 says that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to know and experience the inner life more and more, we need to learn to differentiate all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should forget about everything but life and learn to do only one thing: open ourselves to Christ, take Him as the tree of life, feed on Him, drink of Him, and breathe Him in more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This produces the genuine growth of life.</S>
