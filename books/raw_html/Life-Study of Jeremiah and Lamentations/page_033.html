God's correction is a matter of His chastisement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ISRAEL THE WIFE'S APOSTASY</H2><P>Jeremiah 3:6-11 speaks of Israel the wife's apostasy. To commit apostasy is to leave the right way and go another way; it is to leave God and turn to idols. In this section of His holy Word, Jehovah as a Husband deals with the apostasy (unfaithfulness) of His treacherous wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Israel Having Been Divided<br>into Two Kingdoms</H2><P>Israel had been divided into two kingdoms: the north was called the kingdom of Israel, and the south, the kingdom of Judah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Northern Kingdom of Israel<br>Becoming the Apostate</H2><P>The northern kingdom of Israel became the apostate and committed spiritual fornication (adultery) with idols (vv. 6, 9). The idols were Israel's evil lovers. Israel should have had only one husband, but instead she had many lovers, many idols.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Northern Kingdom of Israel<br>Being Divorced by Jehovah</H2><P>Because of her fornication, which polluted the land, the northern kingdom of Israel was divorced by Jehovah (vv. 8a, 9).</P>
