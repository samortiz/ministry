NOR... NOR&rdquo;</em></h2>
<p>In 1:13 the apostle John says, &ldquo;Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man.&rdquo; John emphasized the matter of begetting with three words in the negative&mdash;<em>not, nor, nor</em>&mdash;so that we would clearly know that our begetting is completely of God and that it has nothing to do with man.</p>
<p>The first of these three words refers to our body of flesh and blood. Our body is born of flesh and blood, but our spiritual birth is not related to blood. The second and third words refer to the soul-life. Man has not only an outer, visible life of flesh and blood but also an inner, invisible soul-life. The soul has three parts: mind, emotion, and will. The will of the flesh and the will of man are related to man&rsquo;s fallen will and man&rsquo;s created human will. Our thoughts represent us in terms of their expression, and our will represents us in terms of its intentions. That which is begotten of blood refers that which is begotten by flesh and blood, and that which is begotten of the will of the flesh or of the will of man refers to that which is begotten by the intentions of our soul-life.</p>
<p>The created soul-life that was present before the fall was affected by the fall; thus, there was the soul-life before the fall and the soul-life after the fall. <em>The will of the flesh</em> refers to the soul-life after the fall, whereas <em>the will of man</em> refers to the soul-life before the fall. According to John, those who believe in and receive the Lord Jesus are not begotten of blood, which speaks of the human life associated with flesh and blood, nor are they begotten of the soul-life, which was affected by the fall and which speaks of the intentions related to the fallen soul-life, nor are they begotten of the intentions that were present in our soul-life prior to the fall. The life that we have received from the Lord is not related to flesh and blood, and it is not related to the soul-life, either after or prior to the fall. It is only related to the life of God.</p>
<p>This shows that while a man of flesh and blood who has been affected by the fall certainly needs God&rsquo;s life, even a pure created man, who is not fallen and who has not been corrupted to become the flesh, would still need God&rsquo;s life. The life that we receive upon believing in the Lord is not a life related to flesh and blood; neither is it related to our soul-life, either after or prior to the fall. The life that we receive from the Lord comes to us entirely apart from anything of our human life; it is the life of God that comes from God.</p>
<p>These words should be applied to our living. After we receive the Lord and obtain God as our life, we should not live by the will of the flesh, that is, our fallen soul-life. Neither should we attempt to live by our pure, created soul-life. Our soul-life expresses both hate and love, and it is both narrow and broad. The hateful and narrow expressions of our soul-life are related to the will of the flesh, whereas the loving and broad expressions are related to the pure created will of man. Being stingy and miserly are related to the soul-life of the flesh, whereas being generous and charitable are related to the pure created will of man. Intolerance and condemnation come out of the will of the flesh, the soul-life of the flesh, whereas tolerance and magnanimity are virtues related to the will of man, the soul-life of created man. Although God&rsquo;s children know that they need to reject the will of the flesh, few know that they need to reject the will of their good humanity, that is, the good virtues of their created soul-life. Consequently, when a brother is praised for being broad-hearted or a sister is praised for being meek and loving, we may have little realization that these traits can be merely good expressions coming out of the human soul-life, not out of the life of God.</p>
<p>Many years ago a sister from the northwest came to Shanghai for fellowship and then left for Nanking after several days. I also went to Nanking a few days later. Upon my arrival, I heard several responsible brothers praising the spirituality of this sister. They said, &ldquo;This sister walks so meekly, speaks so elegantly, and sits so properly; she is truly spiritual.&rdquo; I smiled and said, &ldquo;If meekness, elegance, and properness are spirituality, then the statue of Mary in a Catholic cathedral is even more spiritual.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are confusing us. Are you saying that a person can be spiritual if he speaks with a rasping voice, hops around instead of walking, and slouches when he sits?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Of course not, but being loud or being meek and quiet are not the proper measure of spirituality. You may think that this sister is spiritual because she is quiet and meek, but you have no realization that meekness and quietness are part of her natural disposition; she was meek and quiet even before she was saved.&rdquo; According to John&rsquo;s words, this sister&rsquo;s meekness and quietness were &ldquo;begotten&rdquo; of the will of man; they were &ldquo;begotten&rdquo; by the good side of her created soul-life; they were not begotten of God.</p>
<p>Some sisters express their anger in very elegant ways, but others sound like they are quarreling even when they speak pleasant words. Neither expression is spiritual, and neither expression is begotten of God. Although our hatred, jealousy, and narrow-heartedness are not begotten of God, it is also possible for our love, magnanimity, and broad-heartedness to not be begotten of God.</p>
<p>The life that we have received from the Lord is not of man but of God. This life is not according to man&rsquo;s blood, man&rsquo;s fallen soul, or man&rsquo;s created soul. God&rsquo;s life is altogether apart from man. Just as our hatred is not out of God, our human love is not out of God. Just as our hot temper is not out of God, our human meekness is not out of God. Just as our narrowness is not out of God, our human broadness is not out of God. God wants to enter into us to be our life, and with His life we have authority to become children of God. Becoming children of God is not only a matter of nature, position, or name; it is a matter of enjoyment. We can enjoy everything of God when we become children of God. All His riches are our blessing and our right.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
