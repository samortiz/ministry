A CONCLUDING WORD CONCERNING CHRIST<br>IN THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>IN THE FIRST BOOK OF THE PSALMS</H2><P>The first book of the Psalms comprises Psalms 1&#151;41. We should not forget that in this first book there are seven psalms which speak concerning Christ: Psalm 2, Psalm 8, Psalm 16, Psalms 22&#151;24, and Psalm 40.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In the Mixed Expressions of<br>the Sentiment of God's Lovers and Seekers,<br>Christ Being Revealed as the Centrality<br>and Universality of God's Economy</H2><P>In the mixed expressions of the sentiment of God's lovers and seekers, Christ is revealed as the centrality and universality of God's economy. David was surely a lover of God and a seeker of God just as Peter was in the New Testament. Peter made mistakes, but he loved the Lord and sought after the Lord. This is why the Lord came to him and asked him, "Simon..do you love Me?" (John 21:17). Christ would not ask someone this question if he did not love Him. For Christ to ask Peter if he loved Him is precious. David was also a lover and a seeker of God. In the mixed expressions of his sentiment, Christ is revealed as the centrality and universality of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1.

Bringing God into Man in His Incarnation<br>and Man into God in His Resurrection</H2><P>Psalm 8 reveals that as the embodiment of God, Christ has brought God into man in His incarnation and man into God in His resurrection, thus bringing heaven to the earth and joining the earth to heaven to be the excellent One in all the earth.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_147.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_149.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 148</div><br></body></html>
