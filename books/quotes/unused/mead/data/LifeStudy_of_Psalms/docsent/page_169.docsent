   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. The King's Daughter Being All Glorious</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>within the Royal Abode</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 13a says, "The king's daughter is all glorious within the royal abode."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The king's daughter is the queen signifying the church, and her being all glorious within the royal abode signifies the glorious church taking Christ as her royal abode.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "abode" here refers to the church's taking Christ as her abode.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First we, the believers of Christ, take Christ as our abode, and then we become His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that the abode becomes the abode.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ becomes an abode when we take Him as our abode, abiding in Him, and thus become His abode in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning this, the Lord Jesus said, "Abide in Me and I in you" John 15:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that if we take Him as our abode, we become His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way the abode becomes the abode.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This abode is a matter of experiencing Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ, as the Son, is an abode to the Father and the Spirit, and His being such an abode involves the coinherence among the three of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we believe in Christ, we enter into Him and take Him as our abode.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then, being in Him as our abode, we, the church, become His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>G. Her Garment Being of Woven Work</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Inwrought with Gold</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold" Psa 45:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This signifies that the Christ who has been dealt with through death and resurrection is the righteousness of the church to meet the righteous requirement of God for her to be justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus "woven work inwrought with gold" again refers to the first layer of her covering Christ as our righteousness through whom we are justified signified by the gold of Ophir.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>H. She Being Led to the King</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>in Embroidered Clothing</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"She will be led to the king in embroidered clothing" v. 14a . This embroidered clothing, another garment, the second layer of her covering, signifies that the church will be led to Christ at their marriage clothed with the righteousnesses of the saints to meet the requirement of Christ for their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regarding this, Revelation 19:8 says, "It was given to her the overcomers as the Lamb's wife that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word "righteousnesses" refers to Christ as our subjective righteousness, Christ lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The righteousness Christ that we received for our salvation 1 Cor 1:30 is objective and enables us to meet the requirement of the righteous God, whereas the righteousnesses of the overcoming believers are subjective Phil 3:9 and enable them to meet the requirement of the overcoming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would have these righteousnesses, we must have Christ Himself lived out of us to be our subjective righteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the queen in Psalm 45 has two garments.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first garment, the gold of Ophir, the woven work inwrought with gold, corresponds to Christ as our objective righteousness, which is for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second garment, the embroidered clothing, corresponds to Christ as our subjective righteousnesses, which are for our victory.</S>
