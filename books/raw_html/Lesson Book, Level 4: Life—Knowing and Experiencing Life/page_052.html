<h2 class=head2>B. A Godless Civilization</h2><p>[Man fell by committing sin and was expelled from the garden of Eden! His relationship with God became abnormal. But God prepared a covering of skins for man’s redemption, enabling him to remain in His presence. As yet, man had not lost God. However, during Cain’s lifetime man fell deeper into sin. Cain said to God, “Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid’’ (Gen. 4:14). “And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah’’ (v. 16). Thus man left God’s presence completely and lost God.<p>When he lost God, man naturally lost God’s provision, protection, and pleasure. When man lost God’s care for his livelihood, he first experienced fear; he feared the lack of supply, defense, and happiness. In other words, he feared poverty, danger, and boredom with life. Therefore, in order to meet the necessities of life and survive, man used his own strength and devised means of supply, defense, and amusement. From this time, man created a godless civilization.<p>Genesis 4 clearly reveals this to us. After the fall of Cain, out of his descendants were produced the founders of man’s own supply for these three great needs of life. These were the three sons of Lamech. Jabal was the father of tent-dwellers and cattlemen. Tents and cattle are for the supply of man’s living and therefore belong to the category of provision. Another son, Jubal, was the father of all that handle the harp and organ. Playing harp and organ is for pleasure; thus it belongs to the category of amusement. The third son, Tubalcain, was the instructor of every artificer in brass and iron instruments. These instruments were formed for the purpose of defense, thus referring to the category of protection. Since these three important inventions originated at that time, humanity found no need of God. Man found within himself the answer to the need of supply, defense, and amusement. This was the civilization produced after the human race lost God—a godless life created by men.]<h2 class=head2>C. Satan’s System</h2><p>[When mankind lived a godless life, Satan immediately disguised himself and utilized these avenues as a means to possess man. He caused man to employ his entire effort to seek food and clothing for self-nurture, to invent instruments for self-defense and to design various forms of amusements for self-enjoyment.]<p>[In the beginning, these various forms of occupations involving man’s livelihood seemed rather trivial, scattered and unsystematized. Later, Satan organized these into a more tangible and systematized world, thus entangling mankind in a tighter web.]<p>[Therefore, the formation of the world has five steps. First, man lost God. Second, he developed fear and was desperate concerning his needs. Third, he created a godless life. Fourth, Satan disguised himself and utilized man’s needs. Fifth, Satan organized man’s own supply for his needs into a system. At the completion of these five steps the world was finally formed.]
