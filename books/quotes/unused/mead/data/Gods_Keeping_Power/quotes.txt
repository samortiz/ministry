[3]  If you are relying on the Lord for victory and allow His overcoming life to be manifested in you, you will find fresh nourishment and increased vitality, and you will be fed once again.
[4]  Our bread is not only the word of God, our meat is not only to do His will, our bread is also the Anakim the difficulties that are in our way.

[6]  If we trust in His promises and commit ourselves utterly to Him, we will be kept from this day to the day of His return, and we will be kept without blemish.
