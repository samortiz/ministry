   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE LORD 7:9b-13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 9b says, "...that goeth down smoothly for my beloved, and causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Translator's note: See Darby's New Translation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This part is spoken by the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's speaking continues to the second part of verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At this point, the maiden is able to continue where the Lord left off because she is so one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The wine flows smoothly into her Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that she and her Beloved have tasted a foretaste of this blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, tasting this wine is not limited to the two of them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many others who are asleep who have tasted of this wine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither the word "asleep" nor the word "sleep" in 5:2 means something bad.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The tone does not convey the sense that sleep is a bad thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, the ones who are asleep are in the same position as the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the sleeping ones refer to those who are asleep to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have lost consciousness of themselves and are only living to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 10 of chapter seven says, "I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Her attention is drawn toward who her beloved is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She has given up her obsession with herself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems as if she is willing even to lose her beloved if it would please him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She is only concerned with whether or not her beloved has gained her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She knows that she belongs to her beloved, and this is enough to satisfy her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The former grasping of the flesh is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the beginning, the fact that she belonged to her beloved was a secondary thought.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, it became her primary thought.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She was unable to forget that her beloved was hers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now, because of the depth of her experience, we no longer hear that her beloved belongs to her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Indeed, in our spiritual pursuit, the self is working constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Little do we realize that even in the matter of loving the Lord, there is the possibility of reserving a place for the self!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The matter now is not our pleasure, but His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that our existence is for the purpose of satisfying His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our purpose for living is to be the object of His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are to be the desired ones of the desiring One.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The question now is not what we feel, what we gain, what we lose, or what our work is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is of importance to us is that we are His, and His desire is toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is all that matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a believer reaches this stage, and when the self is dealt with in such a thorough way, he can begin to work with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because he is so filled with the Lord, he can now initiate some work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Outwardly, it may look as if he is the one who initiates the work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, it is the Lord within who is initiating the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the union between the maiden and the Lord is so absolute, her movement becomes very dependable, and she can now speak the words in the following verse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 11 says, "Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Let us go forth into the field."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now she is no longer acting alone, and the Lord is no longer acting alone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is a joint work of "us."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From this point on, we see the fellowship in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since she is liberated from herself, she is also delivered from all narrowness and pettiness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Her focus is no longer on her meeting, her work, her church, or her group.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Her attention is the field, the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She has a world view, not just an "unworldly" view.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She is interested in everything that happens in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She does not have a so-called work of her own, and she does not have a so-called region of her work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All of the Lord's work is the sphere of her work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The whole focus is turned to the field.</S>
