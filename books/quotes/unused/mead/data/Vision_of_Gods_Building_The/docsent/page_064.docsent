   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH LIFE AS SEEN IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are more than forty major points as aspects of the church life which we can learn from the vision of the New Jerusalem recorded at the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first point is that this city is the ultimate consummation of God's building work from the beginning of creation throughout all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first thing which the Apostle John saw in his vision was a new heaven and a new earth Rev 21:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following that, he saw the New Jerusalem descend out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Heaven and earth represent God's work of creation, but the New Jerusalem represents God's work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that following His initial work of creation, God has continued to work through many generations to achieve His ultimate building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis 1 and 2 record God's creation work, but from Genesis 3 to the end of the Scriptures God is continually working for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us recall the vital meaning of God's building: it is that God is building Himself into man and building man into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the very mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout all generations God has been working along this line for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Scriptures mainly reveal that God's whole work since creation has been to mingle Himself and man together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Word of God, God Himself, became incarnated as a man, this was an expression of the living tabernacle, a real mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before this time, as we have seen, God was God and man was man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But at the time of incarnation and since that time, something has happened on this earth: God has mingled Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most Christians are familiar with Isaiah 9:6, yet few have been impressed that a child was born on this earth whose name was called the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If this were not recorded in Scripture, no one would believe that a child could be called the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This child was both the tabernacle and the temple, the very building of God John 1:14; 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Divinity had been mingled with humanity this is the real definition of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From the time of God's incarnation as man, especially during a period of thirty-three and a half years, there was a man on this earth with God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus was a real man, a typical man, yet the Mighty God was wrought into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God had come to be a man, and God was brought into man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, that is not all: the Lord Jesus also brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He accomplished this by His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today in the heavens there is a man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By Christ's incarnation, God was brought into man; and by His death, resurrection and ascension, man has been brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While Jesus was on this earth, He was a man with God in Him; today, while Jesus is in heaven, He is the very God with man in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the mingling of God with man and man with God, and this is the meaning of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This mingling has already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now all we need is a mass reproduction of this mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need, experientially, to have Christ incarnated into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then He must bring us through death and resurrection into God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we pass through the cross and into the resurrection, the more we will be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is in us today, but we are not very much in God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why God is doing His work of building on this earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, when we preach the gospel, we do the work of incarnation; we bring God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we immediately begin the work of edification that is, we bring people into God by the cross and the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way we all become the mass production of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When this reproduction work is fully completed and composed together, the result is the enlarged tabernacle, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible is a composition of sixty-six books which tell us how God has been working for over six thousand years to bring His ultimate building into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Bible students speak of many dispensations, telling how God works in one age in a certain way and in another age in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet the ultimate result, the issue of all God's work throughout all generations, will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However we may interpret the dispensations, we must realize that all of God's various ways of working will issue in a certain kind of result the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is indeed logical that a picture of such a building is at the end of the sixty-six books of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have seen from Scripture how in the early stages of history there was a little tent with a little altar.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through many generations that tent has increased until ultimately there is a large tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How significant that the New Jerusalem is still called the tabernacle of God Rev 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This tabernacle is the total mingling of God with man.</S>
