   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WORK WITH GOD TO CARRY OUT HIS DIVINE BUILDING IN THREE ASPECTS FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD'S ETERNAL ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, as co-workers and elders, we must have the realization that we are working with God 1 Cor 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To work with God is not a small thing; it is a divine matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does it mean to work with God?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To work with God is to carry out His divine building in three aspects the church, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is God's universal, divine building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the works of God in the universe are being carried out with this as the center, the line, and the goal for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The goal of the economy of God, which is eternal, is His divine building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This divine building has three aspects: the first aspect is the church, which is easy to understand; the second aspect is the Body of Christ, which is very divine and mysterious and is therefore not easy to understand; and the third aspect is the New Jerusalem, which is even harder to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible has been with us for two thousand years, but everyone has been puzzled concerning the New Jerusalem and no one has been able to explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gerhard Tersteegen, a German brother, referred to the New Jerusalem but in an insufficient way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks referred to it more than Tersteegen did, but it was still difficult for people to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in these seventy years among us in the Lord's recovery, God has given us a thorough interpretation and analysis of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our hymnal we have at least three hymns written in 1963 concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you read them, you will notice that the contents are nearly the same as the present light, except that they are not as transparent as what we see today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not have to be humble or proud; I am just stating a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning the New Jerusalem, all the items and aspects have become clear and have been unfolded before my eyes to such an extent that they are altogether transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the street of pure gold?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are the pearl gates?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And what is the wall of precious stones?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord has shown us that these reveal that the basic elements of the city are simply the Triune God: God the Father is the base of pure gold, God the Son is the twelve gates of pearl, and God the Spirit is for the wall of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Jerusalem is built up with these three divine elements.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How is the city sustained?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our life is sustained by our eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eating and drinking are equally important to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes we can live without eating for several days, but we cannot stay alive as long without drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, we have a divine drinking, that is, we have to drink the flowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our God is forever new; He is also a flowing God, a God who is always flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father is the fountain, and when the fountain emerges, it becomes a spring, which is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the spring flows, it becomes a river, which is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the Triune God is the flowing God with the Father as the fountain, the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the river.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as the fountain, the spring, and the river gives us to drink of Him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a preceding chapter we said that in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus also said, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water gushing up into eternal life" John 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This eternal life is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Jerusalem there is not only the Triune God as our river of water of life, but there is also the tree of life in the river.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tree of life is the Lion-Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ as the redeeming Lamb and the overcoming Lion has dealt with our sin and God's enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This Lion-Lamb as our tree of life has fresh fruits to be our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way the New Jerusalem is sustained.</S>
