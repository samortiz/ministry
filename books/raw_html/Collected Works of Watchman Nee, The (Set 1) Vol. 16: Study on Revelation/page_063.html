<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Revelation 17:11</H2><P>"And the beast who was and is not, he himself is also the eighth and is out of the seven and goes into perdition." </P><P>This verse has to be read in conjunction with 17:8. Verse 8 speaks of the four periods of the beast's history. Verse 11 also speaks of the four stages of the beast's history, which are: (1) he was, (2) he is not, (3) he is out of the seven, and (4) he goes into perdition.</P><P>Since the chronological characteristics of the first, second, and fourth periods in 17:11 correspond with those of the first, second, and fourth periods in 17:8, the third period of verse 11 must also correspond with the third period of verse 8. Hence, he will have to come up out of the abyss.</P><P>Here it says that, on the one hand, this one is the eighth and, on the other hand, he is out of the seven. Furthermore, he comes up out of the abyss. Hence, he must be one of the seven who has resurrected to become the eighth.</P><P>Which one of the seven is he?</P><P>(1) He is not the seventh one, because the seventh one has not yet come into the world (17:10), but he was in the world before (v. 8).</P><P>(2) He is not the sixth one, because the sixth one was still in the world at the time John was there. According to the prophecy, this one "is not" in the world at the time of John (v. 11).</P><P>Since he is not the seventh or the sixth, he could only be one of the first five. Which one of these five is he? From 13:18 we can tell that he must be Nero.</P><P>Revelation 17:8 tells us of the earthly position that Antichrist will occupy in the future, while verse 11 tells us of his royal position.</P><P>The seventh one is the forerunner of Antichrist, while the eighth will come in the resuscitated body of the seventh. Eight is the number of resurrection, but the resurrection of this one is different from the resurrection of the Lord. The Lord is the resurrection Himself, while this one resurrects through the resuscitation of a corpse.</P><P>When the Lord was on earth, the Jews chose the living Caesar over the living Christ. Even after Christ resurrected, men still would not receive Him. The coming Antichrist will be a resurrected Caesar, and men will choose such a resurrected Caesar over the resurrected Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Revelation 17:12</H2><P>"And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom but receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast." </P><P>The "seven heads" are seven kings, and also the "ten horns" are ten kings. However, there are differences between the heads and the horns:</P><P>(1) Horns grow on the head. Hence, the horns must be smaller. The head is the whole Roman Empire, while the horns are but vassal kings under Rome. In other words, they are the subordinate kings of the Roman Empire.</P><P>(2) There is only one head at one time, all the heads being successive, but the horns are all kings at the same time.</P><P>(3) Among the seven heads, only one has not yet emerged, while all ten horns have yet to appear.</P><P>"Who have not yet received a kingdom." This means that they had not yet received their kingdom at the time of John. These ten will receive authority at the same time that the beast, the eighth king, receives his authority.</P><P>Many have said that the ten kings refer to ten kingdoms. This is not accurate for the following reasons:</P><P>(1) The matter of the ten kings has been explained by the angels; it cannot be further interpreted.</P><P>(2) If we change the word "kings" in 17:12 to kingdoms, it does not make sense.</P><P>(3) Since the beast is a man, the ten kings must also be men.</P><P>These ten kings are different from the other "kings of the earth" (v. 2):</P><P>(1) The "kings of the earth" are on earth before the ten kings come, and while the ten kings are reigning, the former remain.</P><P>(2) The "kings of the earth" have always maintained a bond with the great harlot, but these ten kings never have any bond with the great harlot. In fact, the great harlot is eventually destroyed by these ten kings (17:16).</P>
