   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Eve Typifying the Producing of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Nature of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eve is a type of the producing of the church and the nature of the church Gen 2:18-24; Eph 5:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every woman in the Old Testament who typifies the church has her own particular characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eve typifies the church with an emphasis on the producing of the church and the nature of the church, illustrating how the church is produced, what the origin of the church is, and how the church comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without Eve as a type of the church, it would be difficult to see clearly how the church is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The picture of Eve enables us to have an accurate understanding of the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read the explanation in the New Testament and compare it to the picture in the Old Testament, we will have a clear view and an accurate conclusion regarding the producing of the church, and it will be easy to know the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Background It Not Being Good for Adam to Be Alone</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Implying that It Was Not Good for God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>to Be Alone in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The background related to the producing of Eve reveals the background related to the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before God created Eve for Adam, He said, It is not good for the man to be alone Gen 2:18 , meaning that it was not good for Adam to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In its spiritual significance, this word reflects the feeling of God toward Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The man, Adam, symbolizes the God of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For God to say that it was not good for Adam to be alone indicates that God felt that it was not good for Himself to be alone; thus, He needed to create a counterpart for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Adam Being Unable to Find a Counterpart</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Implying that God Was Unable to Find Someone</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>in the Universe to Match Him</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before God created a counterpart for Adam, He brought all kinds of living animals before Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Adam named them one by one, but he was not able to find a counterpart to match him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Adam could not find his counterpart out of all the living animals.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This signifies that God could not find anything to match Him out of all the created things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word match means that the two parties must be similar.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Among so many living animals, Adam was unable to find one who matched him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This implies that among all the created things, God was not able to find anyone who could match Him and be His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Producing of the Church Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Adam could not find his counterpart among all the things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he was asleep, God opened his side and took one of his ribs v. 21 . Adam signifies the incarnated Son of Man, God who became man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 5:14 speaks of Adam as a type of Him who was to come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Adam is a picture of the One who was to come Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Adam not only is a type of Christ as the Head over all things but also as God who became man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The producing of the church began with incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without God becoming man, the church could not have been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God became a man in order to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Adam had to be created first, and then Eve could be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although Christ existed before the creation of the world, in eternity past He had not yet become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to produce the church, it was necessary that Christ come to be Adam, a man; that is, it was necessary for the Creator to become a creature in order to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church possesses a dual nature both divinity and humanity; thus, divinity alone cannot produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To produce the church, it was necessary for God to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Passing through Death</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam Gen 2:21 , which typifies Christ s passing through death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Christ was dying on the cross, His side was opened, and out came blood and water John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Adam fell into a deep sleep, God took one of Adam s ribs from his side.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Bible bone signifies a life of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The water that flowed out from the Lord Jesus side while He was on the cross also signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This life is the Spirit of life, the pneumatic life, which is also typified by the living water flowing out of the smitten rock in the Old Testament Exo 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In John 4:14 the Lord said, Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord also said, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then Revelation 22:1 speaks of the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, water denotes both life and the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Christ died on the cross, His side was opened, and water flowed out; that is, the Spirit of life flowed out from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The opening of Christ s side is typified in Exodus 17 by the rock being smitten and water flowing out.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, the water that flowed out from Christ s side and the rib that was taken from Adam s side both refer to the same matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Christ died on the cross, not only water flowed out from His side, but blood also flowed out from His side.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because of the problem of sin, man needed the redemption of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, when Eve was produced from Adam, there was no problem of sin, and thus there was no need for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was sufficient to take a rib from Adam s side to produce Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, when Christ produced the church, there was the need not only for producing but also for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, His side was opened and both water and blood flowed out.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There are two aspects to Christ s death: one aspect is for producing, and the other is for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>John 12:24 says, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The death of the grain is altogether a producing death, not a redemptive death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The deep sleep of Adam does not signify Christ s redemptive death but His producing death.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When people receive the Lord s gospel, many pay attention to and comprehend Christ s redemptive death, but very few hear of Christ s producing death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, the producing aspect of Christ s death is more important to the saved ones than the redemptive aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The redemptive aspect is something additional, but the producing aspect is according to what God intended for man in His original plan, that is, that man would have life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even if man did not have the problem of sin, Christ still would have needed to pass through death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If He did not die, we could not be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>First Corinthians 15:36 says, What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If the grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, it abides alone.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If Adam had not slept and if his side had not been opened, Eve could not have been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Everything in the universe, both plants and animals, must pass through death in order to enter into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In order for the fruit of a tree to be our life supply, it must be eaten by us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The fruit s being eaten by us is the fruit s passing through death.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This the secret nature hideth, / Harvest grows from buried grain Hymns, #482 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This indicates that the producing death is more important than the redemptive death.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The producing death is the principal objective, and the redemptive death is merely a supplement, an addition.</S>
