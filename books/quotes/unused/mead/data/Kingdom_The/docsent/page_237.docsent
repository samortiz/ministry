   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Sinning Willfully</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hebrews 10:26 says, "For when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some Christian teachers have taught inaccurately that this verse means if we sin willfully we cannot be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not the proper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The proper understanding is that all of the sacrifices in the Old Testament were fulfilled when the Lord Jesus died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To go back to those animal sacrifices is a sinful thing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To go back to Judaism after the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus on the cross is to sin willfully.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As far as God is concerned there is no more sin offering, because His Son offered Himself once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul also indicated that if the Hebrew Christians went back to offer the animal sacrifices, God would judge them Heb 10:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their going back would make the blood of Christ a common thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But His blood is not common, like the blood of an ox or a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, the blood of the animal sacrifices could not redeem, but the blood of Christ can redeem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To go back to Judaism and offer the blood of an ox or a sheep for the sacrifice of sin is to make the blood of Christ common.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This will bring in God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not Insulting the Spirit of Grace</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition to this, to go back to Judaism and the animal sacrifices would constitute a kind of disobedience to the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 29 Paul spoke of insulting the Spirit of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To go back to Judaism is to insult the Spirit of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This portion of the Word shows that once we have enjoyed and participated in the New Testament way, we must enjoy it to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not go back to the old way, to the Old Covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To go back to the old way is a sinful thing to the Lord and will bring His judgment upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To go back would make the Lord's blood something common and would constitute a kind of disobedience to the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE WAY OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we come to the fifth section of the book, which begins with chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this section Paul shows us the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we go on with the Lord, we must take faith as our way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On our way we have many surrounding, encompassing witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way of faith is very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we have the Lord Jesus as the author and finisher of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all must look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not be concerned for the surrounding situations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We simply look to the Lord Jesus as our way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we will not look away to the Lord Jesus as our way, we will lose something and suffer something.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since we have received a kingdom which cannot be shaken, we must take grace to go on in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not be disturbed with difficult situations and circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Go on by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus is the Leader and the Finisher of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We simply look unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By this we will be strengthened to go on.</S>
