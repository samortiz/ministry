   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JUDGMENT Issue No. 36 Scripture Reading: Heb 9:27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is one of the most serious verses in the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It makes one feel uncomfortable when reading it and displeased when hearing it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And inasmuch as it is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is what I want to speak about today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The matter which has been reserved has two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first part is that man will die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second part is that after death there is judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you can escape the first thing God has reserved death, you can also escape the second thing God has reserved judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to God's appointment, first, everyone must die, and second, everyone must receive judgment after death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the first appointment, death, is fulfilled, then the second appointment, judgment, will also be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our friends who are sitting here need not ask if they will receive judgment; they only need to ask if they will die.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The topic of my message today is judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is something unpleasant to your ears and something about which I do not like to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we do not have a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Unpleasant as it is, you must hear, and I must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If death is real, judgment must be real.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are bound to die, you are bound to receive judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you can escape death, then you can also escape judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible tells us many things that are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you believe them, they are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do not believe them, they are still facts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A fact is not going to change into a non-fact just because of disbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A fact is always a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One fact which the Bible tells us about is God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It does not matter whether or not you believe there is a God; God is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, the sun is in the sky, and whether a blind man believes in its existence or denies its existence, the sun is still a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another fact which the Bible tells us about is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It does not matter if a man believes or refuses to believe that there is sin; the fact of sin still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible not only tells us the facts about God and sin, it also tells us about death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This again is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible speaks about death more often than men do in their daily conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you believe that death is real, it will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do not believe that death is real, it will still come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible tells us another fact about the future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many do not pay much attention to this fact because it is about the future.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this fact is as real as the three mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This fact is judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Judgment will occur whether you believe in the fact, or whether you do not believe in it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All kinds of sins small or big, civilized or crude, attractive or ugly, committed by reputable people or disreputable people are subject to judgment by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Judgment from God is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You can choose to believe or deny it; nevertheless, judgment is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have disregarded formalities to straightforwardly tell you about this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not need to spend time to cite evidence to prove that there is judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Facts do not require proof.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is there just as the Bible says He is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible speaks of God at its very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It never elaborates any proof as to how there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Facts do not require proof.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible does not need to prove that you have sin because, in fact, you have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible does not need to prove that you will die because, in fact, you will die.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Likewise, the Bible does not need to prove that there will be a judgment because, in fact, there will be a judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My friends, I want to ask you a question today, "Have your sins been resolved?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps you have heard the gospel a few times, yet you have not resolved the problem of your sin; and you are not yet saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I must tell you that as certain as death is, judgment is just as certain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You cannot tell when you are going to die.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Neither can you tell when you are going to receive judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, resolve your problem of sin today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If it is not resolved, you do not know how dangerous it is.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many people think that judgment is not that important.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, if you do not resolve your problem of sin today and do not deal with the question of judgment today, the judgment will be without mercy for you in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I exhort you not to take your meal or go to sleep until this problem of sin is resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This question is immensely important.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You must deal with this matter thoroughly before God today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Otherwise, when judgment comes, it will be too late.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>THE RESULT OF JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible not only tells us that there will be judgment, it also tells us the result of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the future, God will judge the sins of all men in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He will recompense those who do not know Him and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They will be punished by eternal perdition 2 Thes 1:8-9 and go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>While the Bible tells us that God loves the world, it also tells us about the fire of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we have not obtained the grace of forgiveness, this is most dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The unbelievers will depart from the Lord's face and go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is eternal perdition, and no one can escape it.</S>
