   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SONS OF ABRAHAM Scripture Reading: Gal 3:7, 9, 16, 19, 26-29</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Galatians 3 Paul speaks of the seed of Abraham vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>16, 19, 29 and the sons of Abraham v. 7 . The seed is singular, whereas the sons are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is rather difficult for many readers of Galatians to understand the significance of this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning God s promise to Abraham, there is the aspect of fulfillment and the aspect of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To fulfill the promise is one thing, but to enjoy the blessing of the promise is another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning promises made by one person to another, the one who fulfills the promise is seldom the one who enjoys the blessing of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Usually the person who makes the promise is the one to fulfill the promise, and the one to whom the promise is made is the one who enjoys its blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the case of God s promise to Abraham, God, strictly speaking, is not the one to fulfill the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, the promise is fulfilled by the seed, Christ v. 16 . Christ has fulfilled God s promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the fulfillment of this promise does not depend on the many sons of Abraham, but on the unique seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, with respect to the enjoyment of the blessing of this promise, the many sons are involved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whereas the unique seed is the fulfiller, the many sons are the enjoyers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we understand this matter, we shall be able to understand what Paul is talking about in Galatians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul wrote the third chapter of Galatians as if he were an attorney writing a legal document.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His wording is specific and precise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consider verse 16: But to Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one, And to your seed, Who is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verses 19 and 29 Paul also refers to the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in verse 26 he speaks of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sons of Abraham in verse 7 are the sons of God in verse 26.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we must ask how the many sons of Abraham can be the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The answer to this question involves the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, the seed is the heir who inherits the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, as the seed of Abraham, Christ also fulfills the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The children of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, inherited the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In typology, the good land signifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is both the seed and the land.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is not only the seed inheriting the promise; He is also the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both the seed and the good land are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the unique seed in Galatians 3, Christ not only inherits the promise, but He also fulfills the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The promise God made to Abraham was fulfilled by Christ as Abraham s seed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the matter of fulfilling the promise, we have no part.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only Christ, the unique seed, is qualified to fulfill God s promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this sense, the seed is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in the aspect of enjoying the fulfilled promise, the seed becomes many, the many sons of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I. THE SEED OF ABRAHAM A. Only One Christ</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We know from 3:16 that Christ is Abraham s unique seed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is the seed, and the seed is the heir who inherits the promises.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here, Christ is the unique seed inheriting the promises.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, in order to inherit the promised blessing, we must be one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Outside of Him, we cannot inherit the promises given by God to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In God s eyes Abraham has only one seed, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must be in Him that we may participate in the promise given to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is not only the seed inheriting the promise, but also the blessing of the promise for inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For the Galatian believers to turn back from Christ to the law meant that they would forfeit both the Heir and the inheritance of the promises.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If Christ had not come, there would have been no way for God to fulfill His promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we have pointed out, the One who fulfilled this promise is not the One who made the promise, but the promised One, the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God had promised to give Abraham both a seed and the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This promise was fulfilled by the unique, promised seed.</S>
