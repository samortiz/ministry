<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>17. Pretending to Be Poor<br>versus Pretending to Be Rich</H2><P>There is one who pretends to be rich yet has nothing; there is one who pretends to be poor yet has great wealth (13:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>18. Wealth Obtained by Diligent Labor<br>versus Wealth Obtained by Vanity</H2><P>Wealth obtained by vanity will be diminished, but he who gathers by labor increases it (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>19. Early Chastening versus Rod-sparing</H2><P>He who spares his rod hates his son, but he who loves him chastens him early (v. 24). Discipline your son, for there is hope; but do not set your heart on destroying him (19:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>20. Being Cautious versus Believing Easily</H2><P>The simple man believes every word, but the prudent man considers his steps (14:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>21. Graciousness to the Needy<br>versus Oppression of the Poor</H2><P>He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker, but he who is gracious to the needy honors Him (v. 31). Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker; he who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished (17:5). He who has pity upon a poor man lends to Jehovah, and He will repay him for his good deed (19:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>22. Softness versus Grievousness</H2><P>A soft answer turns away anger, but a grievous word stirs up anger (15:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>23. Poverty with Love versus Wealth with Hatred</H2><P>Better is a dinner of vegetables where love is, than a fattened ox and hatred with it (v. 17). Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it than a house full of feasting with strife (17:1).</P>
