   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Isaac Grown Up Christ Formed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the birth, there is the need of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 8 says that "the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not sufficient simply to bring Christ forth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The very Christ whom we have brought forth must grow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past few years, many of us have brought forth Christ, but I wonder whether this Christ has grown up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Has there been the time of weaning?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaac grew up and was weaned away from his mother's nourishment, meaning that he was no longer a young child but had become a young boy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the day of his weaning, Abraham made a great feast.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can understand the significance of this according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When in the church life we see that Christ has grown up in certain brothers and sisters, we all will be happy and have a great feast, a great enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not easy to have either the birth of Isaac or his growth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, it is not easy to have Christ brought forth, nor to have Him grown up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church life we need to have both the bringing forth and the growth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I thank God that Christ has been brought forth among us, but I hesitate to say that we have had much of the growth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is wonderful to see that Christ has been brought forth in a particular young brother, but we are still waiting to see in him the growth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We want to see that the Christ in him has been weaned and is no longer a baby.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the Christ in that brother may not yet be a full-grown man, we want to see Him as a strong boy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ must be formed not only in us but also among us Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In both our daily life and the church life we need the expression of a formed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we may have a great feast for the enjoyment of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>c Ishmael's Mocking of Isaac</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Genesis 21, it was not the birth of Isaac that stirred up trouble; it was his growth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Isaac was born, Hagar and her son Ishmael were not bothered very much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after Isaac had grown up, Ishmael began to mock him v. 9 . In the biblical sense, this means that Ishmael was persecuting Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God even counted Ishmael's persecution of Isaac as the beginning of the four-hundred-year persecution of His people 15:13; Acts 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ishmael's mocking was a serious thing because Isaac was God's ordained seed and Ishmael was the counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The counterfeit always hates the ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We, the ordained seed, are hated by the counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As Paul says in Galatians 4:29, "But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit, so also it is now."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The growth of Isaac stirred up that persecution.</S>
