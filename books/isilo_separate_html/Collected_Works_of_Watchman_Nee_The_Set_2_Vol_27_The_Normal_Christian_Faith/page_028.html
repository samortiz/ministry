Who will deliver me from the body of this death? Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin."</p><p>Here is a man who was constantly defeated by his own fleshly lusts. When he was at the end of his hopes, crying for deliverance, he saw the way of salvation: liberation by the Lord Jesus Christ. The power of liberation is also in the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">NO LONGER IMPOTENT IN HIM</h2><p>Romans 8:1: "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus." There is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus. "Condemnation" does not refer to any ordinary kind of condemnation. According to some recently discovered old manuscripts of the Bible found in Egypt, this word has two meanings. The first is a legal term; the second is a common daily expression. In the legal context it means condemnation as a verdict. But in its ordinary usage it means impotent, powerless, bound, etc. For this reason I will translate this portion as, "There is now then no impotence... " There is no more weakness and inability.</p><p>Verse 2: "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." Here are two laws. Originally, we were all bound by the law of sin and of death. Now the law of the Spirit of life has freed us; we are no longer under the control of the law of sin and of death. The law of the Spirit of life is in Christ Jesus. Have you seen this? Once again, our relationship with Him sets us free.</p><p>Verse 10: "But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness." Since Christ is in me, I can live.</p><h2 class="head1">MORE THAN CONQUERORS IN HIM</h2><p>Romans 8:35, 37: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?...But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us." Although there is so much trouble outwardly, we are still more than conquerors. Strength is obtained by going through Him. Not that we are able in ourselves. It is all by Him and through Him.</p><p>In the same manner, verses 38 and 39 say, "For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Why can nothing separate us from His love? It is not because of our virtues, but because this love is "in Christ Jesus our Lord"! Love is tied to the person Christ. When we are in Christ, we are in this inseparable love.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING OUR WISDOM</h2><p>Let us look at 1 Corinthians.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:30: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."</p><p>I myself received much help from this verse. Of God are we in Christ Jesus. Not only so, God has made Christ our wisdom,...etc. We think that though we are not too brilliant, if we study more books, read more of the Bible, and listen to more sermons, we will be more intelligent. But this is not what God says. God has made Christ our wisdom. Wisdom is tied to Christ again. He becomes man's wisdom.</p><p>We say that we are unrighteous and that we cannot see God. But what does this verse say? God has made Christ our righteousness. Now we can face God as if we were sinless.</p><p>We think that we are too corrupted; our thoughts are unclean; we are proud and always lie. We have no holiness. Yet God has made Christ our holiness. He can be transmitted into us through Christ to be our holiness. Many have experienced that had it not been for Christ, there would absolutely have been no holiness.</p><p>Concerning salvation, a part of it touches the future. We will not mention it now. At any rate we can see that Christ is our wisdom, righteousness, holiness, and salvation from beginning to end.</p><h2 class="head1">BEGOTTEN AND GROWING IN HIM</h2><p>First Corinthians 3:1: "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ." According to the Scripture, it doesn't matter what your physical age is. What matters is your stature in Christ. This measure is again one that is in Christ.</p><p>First Corinthians 4:15: "For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel." Only in Christ can someone be regenerated and begotten by the gospel.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
