   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Walking with God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 6:9 tells us that Noah walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Undoubtedly, Noah inherited all the spiritual blessings from his forefathers, such as Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, etc. and he followed his great grandfather, Enoch, to walk with God in a crooked, perverse, and adulterous generation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do believe that he was much influenced by hearing of his great grandfather Enoch's godly walk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Noah stood for a strong continuation of the line of life and, with much development, he carried it on further.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 Finding Grace in the Eyes of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genesis 6:8 says, "But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Finding grace in the eyes of the Lord is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does "finding grace" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Notice that this verse does not say that God was gracious to Noah, or that the Lord granted grace to Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No, it says that Noah found grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Remember that Genesis is a book filled with spiritual seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here, in 6:8, we have the first mention of grace in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Noah was able to be what he was because he found grace in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 4:16 tells us to come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace in time of need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was young, nearly every day in my prayers I would say, "Lord, I am coming to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At Your throne of grace I find grace for my timely need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, I need Your grace every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I not only need Your grace every year, every week, every day, and every hour, but every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without Your grace, I simply cannot bear anything."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today I still need the Lord's grace every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps in a few minutes my folks will give me a difficult time, or else one of the brothers will come to bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps I will receive a phone call from a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So, I keep on telling the Lord, "Lord, I need Your grace every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I know that You are gracious and that You have grace ready for me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord, since grace needs my cooperation, I kneel before the throne of grace to find grace to meet my need."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times we simply cannot stand our situation and we cannot face what is happening to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, there is a place called the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Come boldly to the throne of grace that you may find mercy and grace for your time of need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you believe that, by himself, Noah was able to find grace in the eyes of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not believe that he did this by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The flood came 1,656 years after Adam was made.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Adam lived for nine hundred thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This leaves seven hundred twenty-six years from the year Adam died to the year the deluge came.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Adam was six hundred twenty-two years of age, Enoch was born and he lived as a contemporary of Adam for three hundred and eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Adam died, Enoch still lived another fifty-seven years before he was taken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sixty-nine years later Noah was born.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So, Noah was born only one hundred twenty-six years after Adam's death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Enoch was sixty-five, he begat Methuselah and then lived for another three hundred years before he was taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Methuselah lived for nine hundred sixty-nine years, dying in Noah's six hundredth year, the year the deluge came.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Undoubtedly, Enoch learned the things of God from his forefathers, perhaps even learning directly from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fact that Enoch named his son "Methuselah," which means "when he is dead, it shall be sent," proves that he taught his son concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Methuselah must have taught his son, Lamech, and Lamech his son, Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Noah came from a godly family and learned from his forefathers all the godly things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, he came to realize his need for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His generation was corrupt and filled with violence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The human race had become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Noah lived in a crooked, perverse, and evil generation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, his parents and grandparents taught him the things of God, and he realized that he needed God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we can see why Noah found grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 3 of the same chapter indicates that God was prepared to give grace to fallen man, because His Spirit was striving with man, ready to give grace to the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, this grace needed human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Noah gave the necessary cooperation and he found grace.</S>
