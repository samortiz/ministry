<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Opening of the Seven Seals&#151;<br>the Mystery of God's Economy</H2><P>Revelation 4 shows us the scene around the throne in the heavens. Regardless of what is happening on the earth, this does not affect God. He is above the earth, in the heavens, and still on the throne. The scroll with the seven seals was in the hand of the One sitting on the throne (5:1). These seven seals are the seven secrets of the universe, which are the mystery of God's economy. The Lamb, Christ, was worthy to take the scroll from the One on the throne and open its seals (vv. 7, 9).</P><P>Christ has opened the first four seals, which consist of four horses with their riders (6:1-8). The first horse signifies the gospel, the second horse signifies war, the third horse signifies famine, and the fourth horse signifies death. Since the time Christ ascended to the heavens and began to open the seven seals, the mystery of God's economy, these four horses have been running on this earth. The preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death have been running on this earth for close to two thousand years. Since Christ's ascension, wars have increased. These wars have caused the shortage of food, and war with the shortage of food have issued in disease and death.</P><P>When Christ opened the fifth seal, John saw a group of martyrs under the altar, that is, underneath the earth (v. 9). These martyrs cried out, "How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" (v. 10). The Lord told these martyrs to "rest yet a little while, until also the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed, even as they were, is completed" (v. 11). The cry of the martyred saints must occur near the end of this age. The fellow slaves and brothers who are about to be killed will be the martyrdom during the great tribulation (20:4).</P><P>The sixth seal, which marks the beginning of supernatural calamities, is God's answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal and is a warning to those who dwell on the earth (6:12-17). The seventh seal includes many negative and positive things. The seventh seal, the entire contents of the seven trumpets (8:1-2), includes the supernatural calamities of the first four trumpets (vv. 7-12). The seventh seal also includes the three woes of the last three trumpets (8:13&#151;9:21; 11:14-15a, 18, 19b).</P><P>In the seventh trumpet of the seventh seal there will be the war at Armageddon where Antichrist with all his armies will be defeated (16:13-16; 19:11-21). Antichrist and the false prophet will then be thrown alive into the lake of fire (19:20). The seventh trumpet also includes the destruction of the great Babylon in Revelation 17 and 18. Religious Babylon is dealt with in chapter seventeen, and political Babylon is dealt with in chapter eighteen. Religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, will be destroyed by Antichrist at the beginning of the great tribulation because of his opposition to any kind of religion (14:8; 17:16). The material Babylon, the city of Rome, will be fallen, destroyed by God (16:19), at the end of the great tribulation (18:2).</P><P>Revelation 19 tells us that after the destruction of religious and material Babylon, there will be the wedding day of the Lamb and the overcomers. The overcoming race eventually becomes a collective bride to Christ, the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9). I hope that we all will be a part of this collective bride. Revelation 19 also tells us that the overcoming Christ will come down from the heavens to the earth with His armies (vv. 11-14). The overcoming race, the newly married bride, will be the overcoming armies of the Bridegroom. Both the Bridegroom and His bride will come to Armageddon to defeat Antichrist with his armies. This will be Christ's treading of the great winepress where He destroys all the Gentile evil worldly forces (vv. 15-21).</P><P>After the destruction of Antichrist, Satan will be bound and imprisoned in the abyss by an angel for one thousand years (20:1-3). For one thousand years, the earth will be rid of Satan, and Christ will have the earth as His kingdom (vv. 4-6). At the end of the millennium, some of the nations will revolt against Christ, but fire will come down out of heaven to devour these rebellious ones (vv. 8-9). After the thousand years, the devil will be thrown into the lake of fire (v. 10).</P><P>Then the great white throne will be set up to judge the unbelieving dead and the demons (vv. 11-15). Along with death and Hades, they will be cast into the lake of fire. This will clear up the entire universe. The old heaven and the old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed to become the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:10-13), into which the New Jerusalem will come to be God's eternal expression.</P><P>We do not want to be defeated Christians. We want to cooperate with our God to be the overcomers in this age so that He can accomplish His purpose. Our eternal God can never be defeated. He is never disappointed. Eventually, He will have the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom with the overcomers, and afterward, in the new heaven and new earth, He will have an enlarged New Jerusalem, which includes all the saved ones who will have been perfected in the millennial kingdom. We will then be God's tabernacle for God to lodge in and enjoy us (Rev. 21:3), and God will be the temple for us to lodge in and enjoy Him (21:22). This is the mutual enjoyment and mutual lodging between the redeeming Triune God and His redeemed tripartite people for eternity. This consummates the entire New Testament.</P>
