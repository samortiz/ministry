   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Thus, it is not only necessary to have a spiritual purpose, but the process must also be of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The method must be of the spirit, and the man himself must be one who is of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only that which is from the Holy Spirit can be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only that which was out of Adam could return to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First it must be Adam's body, and then it could be Adam's bride.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First we must be the Body of Christ, and then we can be brought back to be the Bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We hope that we may touch some spiritual reality in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to see what God is really after.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He requires that everything be out of Christ, that everyone be born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every Christian, therefore, must pursue the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not seek the life of the Body, we cannot seek the life of the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should never think that it does not matter much whether we experience the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must realize that if we have the life of the Body today, we will have the life of the Bride in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we live vaguely and aimlessly today, we will never know the life of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every Christian must know the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the sight of God, we must seek after this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot just live as individuals; we must walk together with other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A Christian must see that he is a member of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is not simply one Christian among many, but he is also a member.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He must live as a member with many other Christians, having a mutual, Body-relatedness with them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we really know the life of the Body, we will see that a Christian cannot live one day without the Lord Jesus, and neither can he live one day without other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without the Lord Jesus he cannot exist, and without other Christians he cannot exist.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is after a Body, not many single, isolated Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God desires a whole Eve, not a hand here and a foot there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He must obtain Eve as a whole being; then she will be of use to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He does not want one who is disabled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He wants a new man, a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason all division and individualism must be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The matter of division is not merely something outward it is a problem of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Martin Luther said that the greatest pope does not live in Rome but right in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must realize that the greatest hindrance to God's will is not outward divisions but ourselves, as individual persons, who do not know the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At this point we need two different revelations: first, to see that the Body is one, and second, to see that we are part of it, that we are members of this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we see that the Body is one, we will never dare to be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we see that as members we are but a portion of the whole Body, we will never dare to justify ourselves, or consider that, as single members, we could be a whole unit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only the whole Body together can be a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We ourselves as members are too small, too insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oh, may God deliver us from being individualists.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we may become those who are useful to Him.</S>
