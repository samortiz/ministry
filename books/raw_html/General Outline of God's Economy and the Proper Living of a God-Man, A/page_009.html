<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 12:12; Col. 3:10-11; Rev. 21:1; 2 Pet. 3:10-12; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20-21; Eph. 2:5; Rom. 1:3-4; John 1:18; Rom. 8:3; Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15; Phil. 3:10</h1><h2 class=head1>AN ADDITIONAL WORD TO THE PREVIOUS MESSAGE ON THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT</h2><p>The previous message on the consummated Spirit may be summarized as follows: God is triune; He became a man and passed through death and resurrection; in resurrection the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—has a consummation, and this consummation is the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processes through which the Triune God passed; in this consummated Spirit the church was brought forth. Then the church became degraded, and the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God became the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit.<p>Throughout the generations theologians have discussed the truth concerning the Divine Trinity and the person of Christ; this discussion began as early as the second century with the church fathers. Although what they saw concerning the Divine Trinity was clear, it was not as deep as what we see today. They also saw something concerning the person of Christ—that He is both God and man. Furthermore, they saw that God became man that man might become God. However, later theologians retained only the first two points, the Divine Trinity of God and the divinity and humanity of Christ, which have been taught until the present time. The third point, which is concerning God becoming man for man to become God, has rarely been referred to.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING THE HEAD AND THE BODY</h2><p>My burden in this message is for us to see the reality of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 1:22-23 shows us that Christ is the Head and the church is His Body. But 1 Corinthians 12:12 says, “For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.” According to this verse, Christ is not only the Head but also the Body with all the members. Thus, Christ is the Head and Christ is also the Body. Both the Head and the Body are Christ.<p>Furthermore, Colossians 3:10-11 shows us that in the new man, that is, in the new creation, the church, there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all. Christ is all the members of the new man and in all the members of the new man.<p>Some may ask, “There is no problem in saying that Christ is the Head. But if we say that Christ is the Body, then how about us? Didn’t we say that the believers are the members of the Body of Christ? If the Body is also Christ, what about the believers?” How do we answer this question?<h2 class=head1>THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING GOD’S NEW CREATION</h2><p>The answer is this: The Body of Christ is God’s new creation. According to biblical principles, the new creation of God comes out of His old creation. God’s old creation was something created out of nothing, but it is not so with God’s new creation. God’s new creation comes out of the existing old things. For example, the new heaven and the new earth spoken of at the end of the Bible are not something out of nothing; they are produced out of the old heaven and the old earth. On the one hand, Revelation 21:1 shows us that the new heaven and the new earth will appear after the passing away of the first heaven and the first earth. On the other hand, 2 Peter 3:10-12 shows us that when that day comes, the heavens, the earth, and all the elements will be dissolved by burning fire. After the burning, the old heavens and old earth will be renewed into the new heavens and new earth.<p>The Bible says that we have been crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20). In particular, Romans says clearly that our old man has been crucified with Christ (6:6). But this is not all. Not only have we died with Christ, but we have also been resurrected with Christ. Hence, Ephesians 2:5 says that God made us alive together with Christ. Therefore, when a person is buried through baptism, he is finished and it is no longer he; but this does not mean that he remains buried in the water without rising again. He is not only immersed, buried, in the water, but subsequently he rises out of the water. This signifies death and resurrection. What is buried is the man of the old creation; what is resurrected is the man of the new creation. The old creation was created out of nothing, but it is not so with the new creation. The new creation is produced out of the old creation through death and resurrection. When Paul said, “I am crucified with Christ,” that “I” was Paul as an old creation. Hence, it was no longer Paul as an old creation who lived; it was Paul as a new creation who lived.
