   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Knowing the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In my entire life I have never met another person who knew the Bible as deeply as Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He received much help from many of the finest Christian writers of past centuries, but he also stood upon their shoulders, seeing more things from the Scriptures than they did.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He not only knew the letter of the Bible, but he also knew the Spirit of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He probed into the depths and touched the Spirit of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His knowledge of the Bible was filled with light and saturated with life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He had not only the objective view of the Scriptures but also the subjective experience of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Knowing the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was truly a man of God, knowing the Lord in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He knew the Lord in His acts as well as in His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He knew the Lord not only according to His love, mercy, grace, righteousness, and holiness, but also according to His eternal purpose and His present economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had both the full, objective knowledge and the living, subjective realization of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knew the Lord personally, as well as in the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Knowing Life</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knew that the Lord as the living Spirit lived in his spirit, and he knew how to exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He practiced rejecting the mind, emotion, and will of his soul, and he also practiced behaving and acting in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way he lived by the Lord as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He cared little for work; he continually cared for life more than work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He said repeatedly that the work should be the outflow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His ministry was not one of work but one of life, carried out by life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He paid much more attention to what he was than to what he did.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was truly a man of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Knowing the Church</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He saw clearly that the church as the Body of Christ was Christ's expression with Him as its life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He also saw that the church could only be practical with the existence of local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He saw too that only churches in localities could carry out God's eternal purpose to have the church built up in a way which the gates of Hades could not prevail against.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He thoroughly realized that to recover the proper church life on the proper ground is God's present economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not teach mere doctrines concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He received a full revelation from the New Testament, not only regarding the content and reality of the church, but also regarding the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through the years in his ministry, he not only stressed the experience of Christ but also emphasized the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His vision was not only Christ, but Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ was his life, and the church was his living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He suffered for the church more than for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The persecutions which came upon him from the denominations came mostly because of his emphasis on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was burdened to carry out his vision concerning the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He desired to see a local church in every city in China.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A GIFT OF THE AGE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I consider Watchman Nee to be a unique gift given by the Head to His Body for His recovery in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I fully respect him as such a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have the full confidence and assurance that it was absolutely of the Lord that I followed this gift for the Lord's interest in His present move on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I feel no shame whatsoever in saying that I followed a man --a man that was the unique gift and the seer of the divine visions in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am more than grateful to the Lord that immediately after being saved I was brought into such a profitable relationship with Watchman Nee and put into the closest relationship with him in the work of His recovery through so many events over a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The revelations concerning Christ, the church, the spirit, and life which I saw through Watchman Nee, the infusions of life which I received from him, and the things concerning the work and the church which I learned from him will require eternity to evaluate their true worth.</S>
