   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE TWO CORPORATE MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that one cannot separate Christ from truth or from the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nor can He be isolated from the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What then is the relationship Christ has with us human beings?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THREE IMPORTANT CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before we come to look at the relationship Christ has with man, we have to investigate the law of heredity a little.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A life which bears a particular trait or feature in its nature may transmit that same feature to the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Looking at it another way, we can find the temperament and idiosyncrasies of the father in a child.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But whatever is acquired by learning is not hereditary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, a blacksmith may acquire strong and husky arms through his training, but his children's arms may remain small and thin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever is acquired after birth cannot be transmitted to the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a fact and phenomenon recognized by biological science.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a very important concept in the Bible known as the unity of men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the Bible, apart from our individual existence, the whole world, regardless of how many millions of people there are, can be considered as being composed of two men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These two men are corporate, embracing millions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The whole of humanity is included in these two men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are two juristic persons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Due to this reckoning in the Bible, the man Jesus could die for all of us and bear all of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now all of us can receive life through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A student in biology can tell us that there is an amazing concept in biology which is quite contrary to ours: a son's life is considered to be older than that of the father, and a grandson's life is much older than that of his grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is perfectly true.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The son inherits the father's life and continues it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the son's life is older than that of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your life and mine are naturally older than that of Adam, for his ended at the age of a little over nine hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But you and I are still living and will go on living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are three important concepts we have to consider when we look at the relationship between Christ and man: the heredity of human life, the unity of men, and the continuation of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A HUGE CORPORATE MAN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man is not only an individual, existing by himself, responsible only for his own conduct and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He also belongs to a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every person is a part of a huge life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is a continuation, and he is continuing this huge life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first man in this corporate man had a life that embraced all other human life; his conduct became that of everyone that follows, and his traits are transmitted to all successive generations; they all bear the same features as he did.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a vast subject to be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we have to understand these concepts before we can see the salvation of God and the relationship of Christ with man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>MELCHISEDEC AND ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we can turn to chapter seven of the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let us first read verses 1 through 10: "For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And consider how great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And here men, who die, receive tithes; but there, one of whom it is testified that he lives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, he who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes, for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this passage, the writer of the book told the Hebrews that the priesthood that they depended on came from the lineage of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Christ that we believe in, however, did not come from the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, He is of the lineage of Melchisedec who also was a priest .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>MELCHISEDEC GREATER THAN LEVI</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Which one is greater, Levi or Melchisedec?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The answer is, of course, Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But why?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here the writer brought in Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Abraham offered up one tenth of what he acquired to Melchisedec as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not only did Melchisedec accept it, but he blessed Abraham as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, beyond dispute, Melchisedec is greater than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But what does that have to do with Levi?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The link is in the fact that Levi "was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although Levi was born after another hundred or so years, according to the principle of unity, Levi offered up one tenth to Melchisedec when he was inside Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On that same day, he was blessed by Melchisedec within Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this reason Melchisedec is greater than Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our faith has a central concept: whatever a man does or however he acts affects his future generations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If our ancestors have done such and such, so have we.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It does not matter whether or not we were born yet, because we did the same while we were in them.</S>
