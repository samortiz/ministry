   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TAKING CARE OF THE DIFFERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE PERSONS BEING ADDRESSED</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In expounding the Bible, one has to take care of the persons to whom a word is spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some words are spoken to the Jews, and they are not related to the nations or to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some words are spoken to the nations and have nothing to do with the Jews or with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some words are spoken to the church and have nothing to do with the Jews or with the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 10:32 says, Give no occasion of stumbling both to Jews and to Greeks referring to nations and to the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Bible, there are at least these three kinds of people to whom God speaks His words: the Jews, the nations, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Old Testament, the majority of the words were spoken to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament, there are many words that are spoken to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, whether in the New Testament or the Old, there are some words spoken to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should differentiate between these when we read them and should find out to whom the words are spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should differentiate clearly between the different persons to whom a word is addressed, whether it is to the Jews, to the nations, or to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First we identify the persons spoken to, then we can make the proper judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, some Bible scholars have had strong disputes concerning whom the book of Matthew was addressed to.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are many expositors who assert that Matthew was for the Jews and not for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They point out the Jewish background of the words in Matthew, saying that the Lord Jesus was clearly referring to offering gifts at the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To them this is a proof that these words are for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus clearly spoke about the judgment of the Sanhedrin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Sanhedrin was an organization of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They also point out Matthew 24 which mentions the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To them the holy place clearly belongs to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord also said that when one encounters the great tribulation, he should pray that his flight may not be on a Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Would the church still keep the Sabbath?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since these people who receive the word keep the Sabbath, are they not Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These scholars point out many examples like these to prove that the book of Matthew is spoken to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If it were so, this would be very serious, because the whole book of Matthew would no longer be our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After we read through the book of Matthew carefully, we have to admit that the words in Matthew 5 certainly have their Jewish background, but they are not spoken to the Jews; rather, they are spoken to the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The kingdom people not only include the saved ones among the Jews, but they also include the converted ones from among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom people are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because among the kingdom people there were some who had formerly been in Judaism, and who had a Jewish background, the Lord Jesus had to use things related to that background when He gave the sermon on the mount at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are more discussions in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you read carefully, you will find that a portion was spoken to the Jews, a portion was spoken to the church, and a portion was spoken to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapter twenty-four, verses 1 through 31 are spoken to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 32 to chapter twenty-five verse 30 is spoken to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 31 to the end of the chapter is spoken to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In studying the Bible, before we make a decision on an interpretation, we must first ascertain the person to whom a word is spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only then can we understand and interpret the words accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>X. PERSONS, EVENTS, AND OBJECTS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>NOT CLEARLY REFERRED TO AS TYPES</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>NOT TO BE TREATED AS TYPES</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>BUT AS ILLUSTRATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We know that there are many types in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some types are simply individual persons, such as Isaac, who typified the Lord Jesus as the inheriting son, and Rebecca, who typified the bride gained by Christ the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some types are events, such as the Passover of the Israelites which signifies our salvation before God when we received the slain Christ as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another example is the children of Israel s exodus from Egypt, which signifies our going out from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are also some types that are objects, such as the lamb typifying Christ and the brass serpent also typifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Old Testament, many persons, events, and objects are types, but it is not up to us to decide whether or not they are types.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to find out the clear evidence from the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there is no mention in the New Testament of the object, the events, or the person as a type, then we should not rashly surmise that they are a type.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the most, we can only borrow these persons, events, and objects as illustrations and use them to explain the truths in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To say that something is a type means more than to say that it is merely an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here we are only presenting and pointing out briefly these ten principles of interpretation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These principles have evolved gradually from hundreds or thousands of years of experience of Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are like the cream of the milk and the honey of the bees, and are very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I hope we can all remember them clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These all are our aids and restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that from now on all the brothers and sisters will apply these principles in their study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we apply them, we will find new meaning to the Bible and will have a better, more accurate, and thorough understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Questions What will happen if we apply the words of the Bible in an isolated way?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How can the background of the Bible help us understand the exact meaning of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why is it important to pay attention to the differences in the dispensations?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is the difference between a type and an illustration?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Give an example of each.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Using various verses, discuss with your companions how to apply the ten principles learned in this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Show the dangers of not applying each principle.</S>
