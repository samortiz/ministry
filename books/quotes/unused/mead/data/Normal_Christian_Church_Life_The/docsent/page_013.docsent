   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As we have seen, the laying on of hands speaks of oneness Lev 1:4 , and the only oneness known among the children of God is the oneness of the Body of Christ; therefore, in laying hands upon the apostles, the prophets and teachers definitely stood on the ground of the Body, acting as its representative members.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Their action identified the whole church with the apostles, and identified the apostles with the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These prophets and teachers did not stand on individual ground to send the apostles forth as their personal representatives, nor did they stand on the ground of any select company to send them out as representatives of that particular company; but they stood on the ground of the Body, as its ministering members, and set these two apart for the work of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In their turn the two, being thus separated, went forth, not to represent any particular individuals or any special organization, but to represent the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All work that is truly scriptural and truly spiritual must be out from the Body and must minister to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Body must be the ground on which the worker stands, and it alone must be the sphere in which he works.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On two different occasions Paul had the laying on of hands; first when he believed on the Lord Acts 9:17 , then on the occasion under consideration, when he was sent out from Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The former expressed his identification with the life of the Body; the latter his identification with the ministry of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first proclaimed him a member of the Body by receiving life from the Head; the second proclaimed him a ministering member, working not as an isolated individual, but in relation to the other members, as a part of one great whole.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In sending Barnabas and Saul from Antioch, the prophets and teachers stood for no "church" or mission; they represented the ministry of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were not the whole Church; they were only a group of God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They bore no special name, they were bound by no particular organization, and they were subject to no fixed rules.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They simply submitted themselves to the control of the Spirit and separated those whom He had separated for the work to which He had called them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They themselves were not the Body, but they stood on the ground of the Body, under the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Under that authority, and on that ground, they separated men to be apostles; and under the same authority, and on the same ground, others can do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The separation of apostles on this principle will mean that the men sent out may differ, those who send them may differ, and the time and place of their sending may differ too; but since all is under the direction of the one Head, and on the ground of the one Body, there will still be no division.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If Antioch sends men out on the basis of the Body, and Jerusalem sends men out on the basis of the Body, there will still be inward oneness despite all outward diversity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How grand it would be if there were no representatives of different earthly bodies, but only representatives of the Body, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If thousands of local churches, with thousands of prophets and teachers, each sent out thousands of different workers, there would be a vast outward diversity, but there could still be perfect inward unity if all were sent out under the direction of the one Head and on the ground of the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That Christ is the Head of the Church is a recognized fact, but that fact needs emphasis in relation to the ministry as well as to the life of the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christian ministry is the ministry of the whole Church, not merely of one section of it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must see to it that our work is on no lesser basis than the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, we lose the headship of Christ, for Christ is not the Head of any system, or mission, or organization: He is the Head of the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we belong to any human organization, then the divine headship ceases to be expressed in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Scripture we find no trace of man-made organizations sending out men to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We only find representatives of the ministry of the Church, under the guidance of the Spirit and on the ground of the Body, sending out those whom the Spirit has already separated for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If those responsible for the sending out of workers sent them out, not as their own representatives or the representatives of any organization, but only as representatives of the Body of Christ, and if those sent out stood on the ground of no particular "church" or mission, but on the ground of the Church alone, then no matter from what places the workers came or to what places they went, cooperation and unity would always be possible and much confusion in the work would be avoided.</S>
