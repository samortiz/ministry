   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 15 says, "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If this word is spoken by the beloved, it is a continuation of 2:13, which says, "The vines with the tender grape give a good smell."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The "us" here is the same as the "our" in 2:12.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Take us the foxes" is in the imperative mood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The foxes always take away the fruit, whereas little foxes break the branches whenever they can.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The foxes only want the fruit, and there is still a possibility of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the little foxes make it impossible to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not pay attention to the matters of the life of the cross before resurrection and the experience of ascension after resurrection, everything will be spoiled by the little foxes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance" RSV .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is only the time for blossoming and the giving forth of fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the state of perfection has not yet been reached.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The manifestation of resurrection is just beginning, and the experience of ascension is just beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are not careful, the foxes can come and spoil them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What are the little foxes?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are the small manifestations, habits, and introspections of the old life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They may not be big sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But a little folly can spoil wisdom and honor Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The little foxes are hiding behind the vines.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are not careful, the vines will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The little foxes are the things that hinder a person from taking the first step in subjective things and that stop the vines from bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the resurrection life is not well established, there is the need to guard against the little foxes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The maiden cannot deal with the small problems the little foxes alone; nor can they be dealt with by the King alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have to be dealt with through the cooperation of the maiden and the King.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FAILURE AND RECOVERY 2:16 3:5</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 16 says, "My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the maiden has seen the King's attitude, heard his calling, and apprehended the complete union, she answers in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She turns back to review her past experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One thing has satisfied her heart her beloved is hers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She is already clear that her beloved is hers, and she also knows that she belongs to her beloved, but these are not the things that she is after now.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She turns back to consider her past experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 6:3 the King is the center, even though she is mentioned as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By 7:10 only the King is the center, and she has forgotten about herself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What she says is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But she does not answer his question.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What a disappointing answer this is!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not saying whether the answer is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are asking whether she has heard what the beloved has said.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A person who has freshly consecrated herself does not know what she should be to the Lord, yet she remembers how her beloved is to her.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She is still the center, and she does not know that He should be the center.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, she still has the feeling that she belongs to the beloved.</S>
