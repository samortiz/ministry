   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that the spirit, which is the mingling of our spirit and the Lord s Spirit, is both the Spirit of the Lord and our spirit; it is the Lord s Spirit mingled with our spirit and our spirit mingled with the Lord s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The New Testament, in verses such as Romans 8:4-6 and Galatians 5:16 and 25, often uses this word, the spirit, which is the mingled spirit, to speak concerning what the Lord is to us and concerning our experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All our spiritual experiences after we are saved, such as our fellowship with the Lord, our prayer to Him, our living with Him, and our obedience to Him, are in this spirit, the Lord s Spirit and our spirit mingled into one.</S>
