   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit of Life as the Essence</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Becoming the Law in the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fourth, Christ is the life element of the Body of Christ, and the Spirit of life is the essence of this element.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This essence becomes the law in the Body of Christ, which is the innate ability of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have said that the mysterious organism of God is fully a matter of Christ being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This life is the element of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The essence that comes with this element is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Spirit of life as the essence becomes the law in the Body of Christ, which is the innate power of this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Triune God Becoming the Law</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the Innate Ability of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, point number five concludes by saying that the law in the life of the Body of Christ, that is, its innate ability, is a living person, who is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This Spirit of life is the realization of Christ as life to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ as life to His Body is the embodiment of God the Father as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, it is the Triune God Himself who has become the law, that is, the innate ability, of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our Living in the Body of Christ Depending on</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Law the Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sixth, the living in the Body of Christ depends on this law, who is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since the law in the life of the Body of Christ is the Spirit of life, its living depends on this law as the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, our minds have to be set continually on this law Rom 8:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our walk must also be closely according to this law Rom 8:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, we have to put to death the practices of the body according to this law Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way, we can have the living in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Main Gifts in the Service of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of Christ Depending on the Spirit of Life,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Which Is This Law</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, point number seven says that the main gifts in the service of the Body of Christ depend on the Spirit of life which is this law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The service in the Body of Christ depends on the gifts of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the revelation of the New Testament, the gifts of the Spirit can be divided into the gifts in life and the miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The gifts in life are those enumerated in Romans 12:6-8 and also include the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, the discerning of spirits, helps, and administrations, as listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 and 28.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The miraculous gifts are those other items listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 and 28, which include healing, operations of works of power, tongues, and interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the gifts in life require the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They come with the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to see that the service in the Body of Christ has the gifts in life as the principal parts and the miraculous gifts as the supplements.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, we should not pay too much attention to the miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are supplements only.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The principal parts are the gifts in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the gifts in life, nothing can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, without the miraculous gifts, although there would be somewhat of a lack, we could still go on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, it would be the best if we had both.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The principal gifts depend on the growth in life, and the key is again the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the principal parts of the service in the Body of Christ also depend on our following the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we follow the law of the Spirit of life, the more we will grow and mature in life, and the more the functions in the gifts in life will be realized.</S>
