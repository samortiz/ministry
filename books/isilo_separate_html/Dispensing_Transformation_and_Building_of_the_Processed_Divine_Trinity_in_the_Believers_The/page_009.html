He is no longer merely the God in Genesis. Rather, He is a God who went through incarnation, who went through a sinless human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, who went through death and resurrection, and who became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection. Furthermore, He ascended to the height of the heavens not only with divinity but also with humanity. He is man exalted and glorified in God to be made both Lord and Christ in the universe.<p>Such a processed Triune God today comes into us to be with us by our believing in Him and receiving Him. The Triune God&#8217;s being with us is to dispense Himself wholly and completely into us to regenerate us.<p>Many Christians know that God has come into them, yet they do not know what God is doing in them. They think that since God has regenerated them, He is doing nothing now but waiting in them until they go to heaven. However, if we read the entire New Testament we will discover that this God who is in us is busier today than when He was on the earth. When He was on the earth He only preached the gospel, taught the truth, opened the eyes of the blind, raised the dead, and trained the disciples. But today this Lord enters into millions of people to transform and renew every one of them. This is much more difficult than His work on the earth. It is rather easy for a person to change. All he needs to do is to change his clothing, get a haircut, adjust his behavior, and alter his accent. In this way he is altogether changed in appearance. However, transformation is not merely an outward change; it is a metabolic change in the inward essence and nature. Whereas the outward change can be accomplished by human work, the inward transformation must be a matter that is absolutely organic.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
