<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUALITY NEEDING THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>This fellowship concerning the building is not doctrine. I have closely observed the condition of God&rsquo;s children. In many places there are good Christians who zealously love the Lord and are spiritual; however, very few Christians are built up. I have seen Christians who zealously preach the gospel criticize those who focus on reading the Word, and those who focus on reading the Word disapprove of those who preach the gospel with zeal. There is no harmony among Christians, and as a result, there is only tearing down, not building up. The views and ideas that Christians argue over do not concern God&rsquo;s testimony on the earth, but because they are not broken, they dispute with one another and destroy the harmony.</p>
<p>The most disheartening thing is that even many spiritual believers are not in harmony with one another. They are spiritual as individuals, but there is no harmony when they come together. For this reason, others cannot touch the presence of the Holy Spirit among them. Their meetings can be compared to a sunset that is full of gloom. They give their opinions, but they are not built up. There is no value in being spiritual if there is no building up. Such spirituality is not genuine. A person who is genuinely spiritual has been built up. The genuineness of a person&rsquo;s spirituality can be tested by the building. Only those who can be built up are truly spiritual, and those who cannot be built up are not spiritual.</p>
<p>After seeing such situations in different places, I have a heavy burden, and I am determined to speak concerning the building wherever I go. Merely being spiritual has no value. Such spirituality will destroy and tear down God&rsquo;s testimony and cause the church to lose the blessing. We do not want a type of harmony that comes from being fleshly or from having false spirituality. May the Lord have mercy upon us so that we would always keep the harmony and participate in His building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CORRECTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we want harmony, we need to be broken by accepting the breaking in the &ldquo;quarry&rdquo; of our daily living. Then there will not be any sounds when we come together. The presence of opinions, different speaking, criticisms, and being judgmental proves that we have not been broken and hence cannot be built up. We must understand that as soon as there are sounds in our coordination, everyone, including those who are not opinionated, will lose God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The requirement for being built up is to accept the breaking. Then we will have the largeness of heart to receive others. As long as a suggestion does not damage the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we can accept it, and as long as a person does not damage the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we should accept him. The more we accept one another&rsquo;s suggestions and are tolerant toward one another, the brighter our inner being will be, and the more we will be able to accept being adjusted by others. If a few brothers make an inefficient suggestion, and we accept it without arguing, the Holy Spirit will have the way to enlighten those brothers. They will sense that they were wrong without our adjusting them. Hence, if we can give up our personal views for the sake of keeping the harmony, the Lord will enlighten them at the right time. If their suggestion does not damage the Lord&rsquo;s testimony or cause His name to suffer loss, we should keep the oneness. Then the Holy Spirit Himself will have the way to correct them. The correction of the Holy Spirit is a correction in harmony that results in mutual trust and building up. If we insist on our ideas instead of giving in to one another, we will lose the harmony and the presence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The more we try to force others to listen to us, the more they will not listen, but the more we learn to listen to others, the more they will listen to us. In our service we cannot assume a high position, put on airs, or demand that others listen to us. Such conduct is the source of many arguments. When we force others to listen to us, there will not be harmony. A forced listening does not build up; rather, it tears down the building. Hence, a co-worker should not have the attitude that the church and the elders must listen to him. Such an attitude indicates that he does not know how to build up others, because he has not been broken or built up by God. The work that he does with this attitude is not pleasing to God. The co-workers who can serve with others, listen to the brothers, and not be hasty to correct others can build up the saints.</p>
<p>Hence, we must learn to be broken, to drop our opinions, to be broad, and to not correct other people&rsquo;s methods of doing things. Only those who are broad can accept the methods that other people use to accomplish things. It is a great skill to be built up together with others without the sound of iron tools, and only those who have been dealt with by God have such a skill. No matter what others say, the atmosphere of our service should be such that &ldquo;neither hammer nor ax nor any iron tool was heard in the house&rdquo; (1 Kings 6:7). This atmosphere proves that we have learned the lesson well. We cannot fathom the degree to which God&rsquo;s presence will be with us if such an atmosphere were among us. The people who come into our midst would sense that there are no opinions among us and that we correct ourselves without arguing. Thus, whoever comes into our midst would be edified.</p>
<p>God wants a group of people who receive His breaking, have a large heart, and do not assume a high position, that is, a group of people who are being built up by Him. Those who are narrow-hearted think that others are narrow-hearted, and those who are crooked think that others are crooked. It is shameful for a believer to assume a high position, to lord it over the saints. It is despicable for a believer to desire to be first, to be the leader, so as to be above others. We must have a vision of the building and desire to be the same as the other saints. As long as a suggestion does not harm the Lord&rsquo;s glory or affect His testimony, we should not only accept it but also follow it. This should be the attitude not only of the younger saints but also of the older ones and especially of the leading brothers. In the church we do not rule others or lord it over them. The church is entirely a matter of being broken and being built up.</p>
<p>The more we are willing to be broken and built up and to follow the saints and accept their suggestions, the more they will follow us and trust us. The Holy Spirit will operate in the saints to confirm that we are living in God and that we have His presence. However, if we argue to prove our case and fight to prove that our idea is reasonable and right, the Holy Spirit will not confirm us in the saints. As a result, the saints will not approve of us, they will not say Amen to us, nor will they support us in their spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us that we would be serious to learn the lessons in this matter.</p>
<p>May we all accept God&rsquo;s dealing and breaking in our daily living. The more we accept the breaking, the fewer opinions and ideas we will have. Furthermore, we will have God&rsquo;s measure. Having been dealt with by God, we will be broad-minded and able to accept others and coordinate with them. We will be built up, and we will also build up others. We may not agree with all the situations in the church, but if we do not argue concerning these situations, the Holy Spirit will work within the saints and bring all the matters onto the right track. We do not need to correct the situations; let the Holy Spirit do it. We must learn to always accept the saints and to reject the self; we must allow the Holy Spirit to build us up with the saints. The Holy Spirit will correct any inappropriate situation among the saints. The correction by the Holy Spirit is the building up that issues in the church being fitly joined and firmly knit together as the dwelling place of God in spirit.</p>
