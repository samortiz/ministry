   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In studying the Bible, the book of books, we need to be clear that the Bible is not a book of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Strictly speaking, the Bible is not even a book of truths.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What, then, is the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for revelation means to uncover something that has been hidden or concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is totally God's revelation concerning Himself, the universe, and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more I study the Bible, the more I am convinced that it is not by man but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are a great many sentences in the Scriptures that could have been uttered only by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To understand the Bible as the divine revelation, we need a spirit of wisdom to know and a spirit of revelation to see.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the reason Paul prayed that "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory," would give to us "a spirit of wisdom and revelation" Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that we need divine wisdom to understand the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The natural human mind and the common human knowledge cannot apprehend the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this we need a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank God that He has created us with such an organ!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As Job 32:8a says, "There is a spirit in man."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has created for us a spirit particularly that we may know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know and to see the things which are covered, hidden, concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must admit that we do not know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only the processed and consummated Triune God knows the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we realize this, the more we will pray, "Lord, we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need Your mercy and Your blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, we need You as the Spirit and as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, we may read the Bible again and again and still not know anything."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible as the divine revelation reveals God's eternal economy, which is for a particular person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is God Himself from eternity, but one day He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the complete God and a perfect man; hence, He is called the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can see God only in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Apart from Christ, or outside of Christ, we cannot see God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, the real humanity is only in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apart from Him, we cannot see a true, real, and genuine man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ came to do the will of the Father John 6:38; 4:34; 5:30 , to carry out God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He lived on earth and tasted all aspects of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He then went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Three days later He rose in His humanity, and by resurrection He brought His humanity into divinity, making His humanity a part of the Son of God Rom 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way He became the firstborn Son of God, regenerating us as the many sons of God Rom 8:29; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He as God became a man, and we as man are becoming God in life and in nature but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the source, and we are the produce.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The produce must be the same as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, we, the children of God John 1:12 , are the same as God in life and nature but not in the Godhead, in the person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a whole, we are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ as the Head and we as the Body form the new man Eph 4:24; Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As believers in Christ, we all are parts of this new man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a brief sketch of the divine revelation concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without this governing view of God's economy, we cannot understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not have such a view as we read the Bible, we will wrongly understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the reason I pointed out in the messages on Joshua, Judges, and Ruth that the most important thing for us to see is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These three books are not merely books of history; they are a part of the divine revelation concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, in these books are a number of types, which are pictures, portraits, showing us how we can participate in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The principle is exactly the same with the books of 1 and 2 Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These books are part of the revelation concerning God's economy and contain pictures related to our participation in God's economy.</S>
