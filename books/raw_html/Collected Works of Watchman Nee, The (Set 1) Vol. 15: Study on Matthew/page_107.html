<P>Prudence or foolishness does not refer to one's nature but to the difference in outward behavior. We can prove this from one instance in the New Testament. See Matthew 7:24-26. The prudent one is the one who puts into practice the Lord's words. The foolish one is the one who does not. The "rock" refers to the Lord's words, and "sand" refers to man's opinions. To build on the rock means to base everything on God's words. The foolish one bases everything on his own opinions. Proverbs says that the fear of God is the root of wisdom. Before God, to be simple-minded is wise, and to disobey is foolish. In God's word, it is foolish to say "but," "or," "according to my opinion." To do things according to God's word is utterly foolish in the eyes of man but is prudent in the eyes of God.</P><P>The two kinds of virgins differ only in two respects: the prudent took oil in their vessels, whereas the foolish did not. The prudent could participate in the feast, while the foolish were excluded. However, they have much in common: (1) they were all virgins; (2) they all carried a lamp, signifying their outward behavior; (3) their lamps were lighted, signifying a conduct that glorified God; (4) there was oil, representing the Holy Spirit, in their vessels; (5) they all went out to meet the bridegroom, that is, they were all waiting; (6) they all slept; (7) they all heard the midnight cry; (8) they all arose, signifying resurrection; and (9) they all trimmed their lamps, that is, they all prepared the oil.</P><P>Although the two kinds of virgins have much in common, slight differences can produce widely divergent results. Should we not then be careful in our behavior? The cause determines the effect. A deviation today will cause a further deviation tomorrow. All future deviations arise from present deviations. Whether it will be glory or shame in the future depends on how we make our choice today.</P><P>The foolish virgins did not take oil. This oil is in addition to the oil that is already in the lamp. The five prudent virgins took oil in their vessels. The lamp here refers to outward behavior (Matt. 5:16, "light" refers to good works that glorify the Father), whereas oil refers to the Holy Spirit (cf. Exo. 30:22-33; Zech. 4:2, 12; Heb. 1:9; 1 John 2:20, 27).</P><P>Here there are two kinds of analogies: the oil in the lamp and the oil in the vessel. The oil in the lamp typifies the Holy Spirit, who dwells in the regenerated person. Every Christian has the indwelling Holy Spirit (see Ezek. 36:26; Eph. 1:13). Proverbs 20:27 (ASV) says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all his innermost parts." Romans 8:9 tells us that all the regenerated ones have the Spirit of Christ. From 2 Corinthians 13:5 and 1 John 3:24; 4:13 we see that if a man is not disapproved, then Jesus Christ lives in him. The Lord lives in us through the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Having oil in the vessel means that there is not only the indwelling of the Holy Spirit but also the infilling of the Spirit. At the time of regeneration we have the Holy Spirit dwelling within us. But the infilling by the Holy Spirit is conditioned upon our pursuit of the Lord after regeneration. Every believer has the Holy Spirit, but not every believer is filled by the Holy Spirit.</P><P>There are two kinds of filling: (1) being filled with the Holy Spirit and (2) being full of the Holy Spirit. The former is related to the gift for the work, while the latter is related to the holiness of life. The oil in the vessel includes these two kinds of fillings: being filled and being full of. The vessel is something apart from the lamp and is not the main emphasis of this parable. It does not have any special significance. Since oil is not a solid, it needs a vessel to contain it. God's desire is that we will not only have oil in the lamp but will also be filled with and full of oil. A student's goal in studying is not just to pass the examination (that is, to be saved) but also to excel (that is, to be filled).</P><P>To prepare the lamp is not the best way; neither is any kind of dressing up. What God cares for is the extra oil. Yet believers today pay attention only to the outward appearance of the lamp. The less oil there is, the more they strive to dress up with a nice appearance. Shining the lamp, however, cannot replace the need for oil.</P><P>We think that it is enough to have oil once, but God requires that we have oil twice. The second oil is different from the first oil. The first time we receive the oil, it is freely given by God. The second time, we gain it by paying a price. Whoever is not willing to pay the price, deny the self, and pursue the oil will never obtain the second oil. May we all be watchful! If we are loose and lazy today, others may not be able to tell whether we have the second oil or not. But no laziness will escape that day; in that day all will be tried.</P><P>Believers, are you willing to pay the price? The filling of the Holy Spirit is the condition for rapture. A balloon can rise only when it is filled with gas. The same is true with us. Therefore, let us all pay the price to prepare oil in our vessel, lest we become the foolish virgins.</P><P>Verses 5-7:"And while the bridegroom delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him! Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps."</P>
