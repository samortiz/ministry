   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A good illustration of dispositional sanctification is the making of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a tea bag is placed into plain water, it "teaifies" the water.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the tea bag is placed in the plain water and remains there for a period of time, the plain water becomes the same in essence, in nature, in appearance, in color, and in odor as the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The plain water becomes one with the tea because the tea gets into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more the tea gets into the water, the more the water is teaified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just as the plain water is teaified, we need to be sanctified, or "Christified."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit comes into us to sanctify us with Christ, to Christify us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit puts more and more of Christ into us so that we become mingled with Christ just as the tea is mingled with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the tea bag remains in the water for a long time, the teaification becomes intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to allow Christ to dispense Himself into us in a full way so that we are sanctified, or Christified, in an intensified way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 6:19 tells us that we need to present our members "as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Holiness is the essence of God's divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John Wesley interpreted holiness as sinless perfection, a perfection without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Holiness, however, is not sinless perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way God makes us holy is to impart Himself, the Holy One, into us so that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To purify water and to teaify it are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are going to serve me a cup of tea, you may purify the water first and then teaify it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Purification is included in teaification, but purification is not teaification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In like manner, sinless perfection is included in holiness, but sinless perfection is not holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People who are under the concept that sinless perfection is holiness put themselves under many regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They may have outward regulations concerning their dress and conduct in order to make themselves "holy."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was a young Christian, I met with a group of Brethren believers who were very strict.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The men had to cut their hair very short.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If your hair was very short, you were considered a most spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the sisters were not supposed to wear anything modern.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They all had to wear old-fashioned clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day I realized that the unsaved people who lived in the countryside in China had the same outward practice that we did.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The men cut their hair very short, and the women all wore old-fashioned clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Seemingly, they were as "spiriual" as we were.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was then that I realized that the teaching of holiness as sinless perfection was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Holiness is God's divine essence, the essence of God's divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For water to become tea, the substance of tea must be placed into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Holiness is when we are "teaified'' with God as the divine tea.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When something of God's divine being is dispensed into us, we are sanctified, that is, we are made holy with God's very essence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sanctification of the Spirit is not an outward change, but an inward addition of God's very essence into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A mortuary has the job of making dead persons look good outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is an outward beautification that has nothing to do with life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our conduct or our outward beauty must be an expression of the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sanctification of the Holy Spirit is not something outward, but something absolutely inward of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE ANOINTING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit of life is also the anointing Spirit 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit of life is liberating, transforming, renewing, sanctifying, and anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit anoints us with all the divine elements of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The anointing is like the repeated painting of some article.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When coat after coat of paint is added to something, the elements of the paint are added to the thing painted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit anoints us with the divine paint, with Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The anointing of the Holy Spirit is not merely a cleansing but a painting of the divine elements of Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's desire is to add Himself into us, to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While the Holy Spirit is anointing us, He kills the negative things in our being, and He purifies and cleanses us with all that Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25 is a full type of the compound Spirit of God with which we are anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The ingredients of this ointment include all that Christ is, all that Christ has accomplished, all that Christ has attained, and all that Christ has obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This all-inclusive, compound ointment is the very paint with which the Holy Spirit paints us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the ingredients of the compound ointment are the essence of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more the Holy Spirit anoints us, the more we become the same as Christ in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we want to change the color of a dark house to green, we need to paint it with green paint.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are like a dark house, and Christ is the green paint.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Green signifies God's rich life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more the Holy Spirit anoints us with Christ, the more we become the same as Christ and the more we become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We become Christ because the essence and the element of Christ has been anointed into us, has been added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The anointing is altogether a matter in life.</S>
