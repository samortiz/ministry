   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Symbolized by the Moon</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the patriarchs, we have the children of Israel, symbolized by the moon, reflecting the sun Christ and shining collectively in the light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The children of Israel were in the night under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the law was good, it was not exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, in this chapter it is pictured as the moon underneath the feet of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to this vision, the moon is not upon her head but underneath her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The moon is bright and shining, but it is underneath her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that the principle of the law is not exalted in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>C. The Church Composed of All the Believers Symbolized by the Sun</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This woman is clothed with the sun, with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Luke 1:78 and 79, when Christ came, that was the sunrising.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Matthew 4:13-16 says that Christ came as a great light to shine upon the people in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that before Christ s coming it was nighttime.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church composed of all the believers symbolized by the sun shines collectively in the day with the glory of God Phil 2:15; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That the church is the major part of God s people is indicated by the fact that the sun clothes the woman s body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since Christ has come, we live in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although, in a sense, the age in which we live is the night and we shall have a greater day when the Lord comes back, this day that began at Christ s first coming is at least a small day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The millennial kingdom will be a greater day because at that time the light of the sun will be seven times stronger than it is today Isa 30:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We live in a small day expecting the coming of a greater day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are in the onefold sunshine expecting a day with sevenfold sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some may argue with me, pointing out that Romans 13:12 says that the night is far advanced and that Revelation 22:16 says that Christ is the bright morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am familiar with all these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Remember that the truths in the Bible have two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must take both aspects, both sides, into account.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since Christ has come, we are not in the night we are in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What are we a star or a part of the sun?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, we are the stars in the night 1:20 ; on the other hand, we are a part of the sun in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How wonderful is this great sign!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is another proof that the Bible was inspired and written by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No one else could have had the wisdom to use the symbol of the woman to signify all of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, etc. were all part of the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But praise the Lord that we, the New Testament believers, are part of the sun because we are a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the vision of the universal bright woman.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>UNIVERSAL</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The woman in this chapter is universal both in time and in space.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She is universal in time, from the creation of Adam to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She is also universal in space, on earth and in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a strong proof that she is not Mary, but Mary is included in her, as we all are.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can people say that this universal bright woman is Mary?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mary is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She is not that bright and she certainly is not universal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mary does not wear a crown of twelve stars.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Neither is this woman merely the race of Israel, for Israel is represented by the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Look at this woman once again: on her head are twelve shining stars representing the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Surely Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were all stars.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The children of Israel are represented by the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No matter how evil and defeated they sometimes were, comparatively speaking, they were a people on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the children of Israel, not the heathens or the pagans, were a people standing on the shining moon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Were the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Romans, or Chinese people standing on the moon?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They might have stood on a lump of coal, but not on the shining moon.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All other races have been and still are standing on the dark things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Among the human race, only one people, the children of Israel, stand on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, they do not realize that the moon is a sign that the sun, Christ, will come.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praise the Lord that today we are the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although there are some Jewish believers among us, they are no longer a part of the moon but a part of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The church is the sun because Christ is the sun and we are a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is the head sun and we are the body sun.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Praise the Lord that we are in the major part of this bright universal woman.</S>
