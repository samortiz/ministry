   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is this law of sin and of death?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I know what my commission is, and I fully admit that my teachings are different from traditional Christian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I don t like to teach anything that is merely traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the law of sin and of death?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is very logical.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law of sin and of death is the law that the law of the Spirit of life frees us from.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that the first law, the law of the Spirit of life, is God triune, processed, becoming the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Surely the other law must be the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It must be an opposite law, but not opposite in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is also in a very complicated way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How did Satan get into your flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Did he simply come in last night while you were dreaming?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have to realize that he came in not in such a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How did Satan get into our flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible doesn t tell us so clearly how Satan could become such an evil law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning how the Triune God could become the law of the Spirit of life, the Bible is more than clear, especially in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There we have a full definition of how the Triune God has become such a law, the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Bible doesn t tell us much about how Satan has become such an evil law, the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, in the Bible there is a principle, that with nearly everything God wanted to do, Satan did ahead of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, in creating man, God had an intention to build a city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know this because the ultimate consummation of the entire Bible is a city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But God didn t build His city right away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even in the Old Testament God desired a city, Jerusalem, among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That city was not built so quickly either.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hundreds of years before the people of Israel built Jerusalem in the good land, Babel was built as an expression of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, Babylon was built, and later in the New Testament the Great Babylon was built.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that many times Satan s way is to do things ahead of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s intention is to enter into man and become man s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But before God could enter into man, Satan entered into man in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before God could become man s nature, Satan became man s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did something ahead of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Children of the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How pitiful that many Christians today make God absolutely objective, and in the same way, they also make Satan objective.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For many years people have tried to argue with me and condemn me because I have taught that Satan is in our nature, that we fallen people are one with Satan, and that we are children of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They consider this to be a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even today the objective theologians don t believe that Satan is within them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They only believe that Satan is the evil spirit who sometimes comes to you to cause you to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Occasionally, this spirit may take over someone in a way of demon possession.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They don t believe that Satan is in human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why then does the Bible say that the Lord Jesus called Peter Satan Matt 16:23 ?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, how could John in his First Epistle indicate that sinners are children of the Devil 1 John 3:10 ?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If children do not have the nature of the father, what kind of children are they?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They must be children picked up off the street.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They must not be born of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If any children are born of you, they will surely have your nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fallen people were born of Satan; they are Satan s children.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So they are one with Satan, with Satan s nature in them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some Christians today don t even believe that we have God s nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They don t believe that God is one with us and that we are one with God, that we are God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They say this is to deify man, to make man God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They have made everything objective.</S>
