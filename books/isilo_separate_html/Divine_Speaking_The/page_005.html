<p>Just as we would have to study, translate, read, and write in learning a new language we all need to practice speaking the heavenly, spiritual and Christly language. In this language there is only one word: Christ. In Revelation 1:8 He is even the Alpha and the Omega, the first and last letter of the New Testament language. This indicates that He is all the letters of the alphabet. Revelation 19:3 also says that His name is called the Word of God. Christ is the letter. Christ is the word. Christ is the phrase. Christ is the clause. Christ is the sentence, the paragraph, the chapter, and the whole book.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING CHRIST TO OTHERS IN A LIVING WAY</h2>
<p>Acts 8:1 tells us that all the thousands of new believers were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria as a result of a great persecution. Only the apostles remained in Jerusalem. Those who were scattered preached the good news of the word wherever they went. Although these believers had been saved only a short time, when they were scattered they spoke Jesus. Had they learned as much as we have? Many of us have been in the trainings for years. We have heard a lot. In the past eleven and a half years I have put out over twelve hundred Life-study messages on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. These printed messages comprise over twelve thousand pages. Most of us have a set of the printed Life-studies on our shelves. We have a lot. Those scattered ones in Acts 8, however, had heard very little about Christ, yet they went out to speak Him. Prior to being scattered they had only heard Peter&rsquo;s messages in Acts 2 through 5. In all of Peter&rsquo;s messages Peter did not speak anything about being saved from hell and going to heaven. What Peter spoke was altogether the resurrected Christ: &ldquo;Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ&mdash;this Jesus whom you crucified&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). This was Peter&rsquo;s speaking, and surely those scattered ones had learned just to speak the same thing. Wherever they went they spoke Christ.</p>
<p>Dear saints, now we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and I do believe that now is the time for the Lord to carry out His up-to-date move. All of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have to speak Christ in our daily life to our parents, our children, our cousins, and our in-laws. We all owe so much to our relatives. Try to write a list of all the names of your relatives. Among these names maybe twenty percent are saved, and the rest are remaining in unbelief. They need your speaking. All of your relatives need the real help rendered by your speaking of Christ. Do not preach in a religious way, but speak Christ to your relatives in a living way. Speak to your father. Speak to your mother. Speak to your aunt. Speak to your uncle. Speak to your brother. Even if both you and your brother are Christians, you still need to speak one to another. Let your parents hear your speaking. Do not talk about computers, physics, or mathematics, but only Christ. He is the unique treasure! Speak about Jesus, Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive, processed Triune God. Your parents would marvel at such a speaking.</p>
<p>Continue to speak Christ every day. All human beings today need Christ, yet we need to speak to them. Speak in a living way, in a practical way, according to your experience of Him. Speak in your office, at the coffee break, at your lunch break, at least five minutes every day, five days a week, four weeks a month. At least twenty times monthly you could speak Christ to them.</p>
<p>In the past few years many of us felt that we could not speak to others due to the defamation of the opposers. We should not take this excuse any longer. Forget about all the defamations. We just need to speak Christ to others. Nothing is so sweet, so fresh, so fragrant as Jesus. We have to speak Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE WORD IN SEASON<br />
AND OUT OF SEASON</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:2, Paul charged Timothy to &ldquo;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season.&rdquo; When I was studying this verse, I checked with myself as to what word Paul charged Timothy to preach. That helped me to go back to the preceding chapter. Chapter four verse 1 is surely a continuation of Paul&rsquo;s thought at the end of chapter three. In the last three verses of chapter three Paul says, &ldquo;And that from a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.&rdquo; From these verses we can realize that the word Paul charged Timothy to preach was the word in the sacred writings of the Scriptures that Timothy had known from a babe. We all have to get into the Word, into the Scriptures. The charge of the Apostle Paul to Timothy was based upon Timothy&rsquo;s knowledge of the Bible. If he had not known the Bible, what kind of word could he have preached? We must preach the word that we have learned from the Word of God. This is what the early believers did in Acts 5:42 when they met from house to house &ldquo;teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; In the home meetings they taught and preached what they had learned concerning Christ.</p>
<p>Paul charged Timothy to be ready &ldquo;in season and out of season,&rdquo; to preach the word. Many times we say that now is not the time to speak; that it is out of season. That is the right time for us to speak. We all must speak out of season. I surely treasure all the young saints and desire to rescue them from the pastoral system. The young ones who are still in school have the most people around them. Every school is a big fishing pond full of fish. This is an environment arranged by God for speaking to others. Students always enjoy listening to their classmates much more than to their teachers or parents. We have to learn to catch these fish by speaking Christ to them. We have to be made the fishers of men, bringing people to Christ and to the home meetings. For this, I do not trust in any human arrangement, but in the young saints&rsquo; acting, behaving, working, endeavoring, and struggling to contact their fellow students. If we would do this, within a short time many would be baptized and added to the churches.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
