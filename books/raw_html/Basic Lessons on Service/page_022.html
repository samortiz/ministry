<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Learning to Apply the Hymns<br>at the Appropriate Time</H2><P>We also need to learn how to apply the hymns at the appropriate time. Certain hymns are good for certain times in the meeting, so we have to know the hymns first and then apply them at the proper time.</P><P>Certain hymns are very good to start a section of the meeting. After a section of the meeting has been started, we may need another hymn to strengthen and enrich the started section. To strengthen and enrich what has been started is not so easy. Teamwork is involved here. One person starts, and all the others have to continue to strengthen and to enrich what has been started. Also a hymn may be needed to prolong and uplift the same section. Here there is the need of skill. Something has been started and strengthened and enriched, but within a short time it may disappear. This is why we have to prolong it and uplift it.</P><P>Furthermore, to apply the hymns at the appropriate time, we need to follow the atmosphere of the meeting. If the atmosphere of the meeting is solemn, a hymn of joy, a rejoicing hymn, does not fit the atmosphere. Thus, calling a proper hymn at a proper time depends upon how much we can sense the atmosphere of the meeting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Distributing the Bread and the Cup</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Neither Too Early nor Too Late</H2><P>The proper distributing of the bread and the cup also requires our learning. We should distribute the bread and the cup neither too early nor too late. This is somewhat like serving a meal. One does not serve the main course at the very beginning of the meal nor after the dessert has been finished. This is either too early or too late.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. When the Remembrance of the Lord<br>Reaches the High Tide</H2><P>We need to distribute the bread and the cup when the remembrance of the Lord reaches the high tide. This means that the atmosphere of our remembering the Lord has reached the highest point.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Better with Some Thanks Given to the Lord</H2><P>Furthermore, it is better to distribute the bread and the cup with some thanks given to the Lord. We receive the bread and the wine mostly in a silent way. It is better to receive the bread that comes from the Lord and give Him some thanks. Luke 22:19a says that the Lord took the bread and gave thanks.</P><P>The focus of this message is expressed in the following statement: the proper remembrance of the Lord depends upon our proper practice.</P>
