It is difficult to find in the Old Testament anyone besides Joseph who was such a perfect type of Christ. He typified Christ in a detailed way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(m) Christ Giving the Remnant of Israel the Last Test</H2><P>In 44:1-13 Joseph gave his brothers the last test and gave them even more time to consider him. Christ will do the same thing to the nation of Israel. The prophecies in the Bible say that Christ will test the ignorant children of Israel, but they do not give the details. However, the record of Joseph's dealing with his brothers gives us a detailed picture of this. Even today the nation of Israel is ignorant of the fact that Christ is testing them. As we follow the world news, we should hold a view different from that of the worldly people. When I read the news, I am aware that what is happening in the Middle East is part of Christ's testing of Israel. The Israeli prime minister and his cabinet do not know that Christ is testing them. They claim to need the Golan Heights and the settlements along the Sinai to secure their existence. However, Christ knows better than they do what they need for their security. Do you not believe that what is happening to Israel today is a test? I certainly do. This is Joseph's testing of his brothers in order to teach them and discipline them. I expect this testing to continue year after year. The Lord Jesus Christ knows how to deal with the nation of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(n) Still Remaining Ignorant of Him</H2><P>As Joseph gave his brothers a further test, they still remained ignorant of him (44:14-34). The same will be true of the nation of Israel as Christ continues to test them. What patience Joseph had! I do not have nearly the patience that he had or the patience that the Lord Jesus has with Israel today. If I had been Joseph, I would have revealed myself to the brothers much sooner than he did. And if I were the Lord Jesus, I would immediately tell the whole world that the Israelites are my brothers. Joseph, however, dealt with his brothers patiently. They were ignorant of him, and the Egyptians were ignorant of what was going on. Only Joseph knew what he was doing. The situation is the same today. Only the Lord Jesus, not the United Nations or the ruler of any country, knows what is taking place. Although He is giving the nation of Israel a difficult time, there is a definite purpose in all He is doing.</P>
