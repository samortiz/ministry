This way, no doubt, has been ordained by God, but it has not been practiced adequately by us. Although I appreciate and value the teaching concerning the God-ordained way very highly, at the present time what we need is the practice with the proper coaching. In the playing of any kind of sport, a coach should give his players lectures, and then he should go onto the playing field with his players to coach them. In the practice of the God-ordained way, we are short of the proper coaching. In order to coach you, I myself must be coached. Thus, I also must practice.</P><P>A coach may coach his players, but when they practice, often they are able to play the game much better than the coach. I do expect that when you practice my coaching, your  practice will be much better than mine. According to my knowledge, very few coaches have ever been star athletes; nevertheless, many young men and women under their coaching have become stars. A coach can teach his players, but he cannot play as well as his players. I hope that some who pick up my teaching, my coaching, and practice it will become "stars."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. EXERCISING</H2><P>In the previous message we covered the exercising of our spirit, our mouth (our tongue), and our voice (our sound) in the practice of prophesying. When you practice what you received in that message, you practice the coaching. We need to exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our voice in all the church meetings.</P><P>In the New Testament, especially in Paul's writings, the need for practice is mentioned. In 1 Timothy 4:7-8 Paul used the word exercise. In verse 8 he spoke of bodily exercise. No doubt, this was a reference to the exercise of athletes in the Olympic games, for in Paul's time the Olympic games were prevailing. No one can be an Olympic athlete without being trained. Do not think that we are merely common persons, sinners, who have been accepted and regenerated by God to remain in our present state. On the contrary, we must be changed, not merely in a moral or ethical way. We must be changed in everything to be according to the Scriptures.</P><P>We need to come to every meeting like a team of players ready to play. Many Christians, when they come to a Christian meeting, do not consider it important to bring a Bible, and most do not like to come early. If a meeting is scheduled to begin at 7:30, very few would begin to come to the meeting at 7:00, a half hour before the meeting. However, if we would come to the meeting early and exercise ourselves to pray, sing, and praise the Lord, this would burn the meeting. When the scheduled time comes and the others come into the meeting, the atmosphere of the meeting will be uplifted to the third heaven already. This uplifts the spirit, stirs up people's inner being, and causes the meeting place to become a "furnace" to "burn" people. Everyone, even the coldest one, who comes into such a meeting will be warmed up. This is the proper way.</P><P>The main thing, the top thing, in the Christian life is to meet. If we do not know how to meet, we are not proper Christians. Thus, the way to meet is a crucial matter. First Corinthians 14 is an entire chapter on how to meet. According to this chapter, in order to have a proper meeting, we must learn (vv. 1, 12, 31, 39). Our coming to the meeting should start at our dining room table. Beginning at that time we should get ourselves adjusted. We should consider, "Now I am preparing myself to go to the meeting. First, we must eat an early meal, because we do not know whether the traffic will be heavy or not. We must arrive at the meeting place not only on time but much earlier than the scheduled time. Furthermore, we must prepare our spirit, and we must pray for our meeting." If we all practice in such a way, the meetings among us will be high and living, and people will be convinced, subdued, and captured by the way in which we meet. Many positive things will result just by our meeting in a proper way.</P><P>We should not be actors in the meetings. Actors live one way and act another way. We Christians should meet in the same way that we live. We should conduct ourselves in the meetings in the same way that we conduct ourselves at home. This applies to group meetings, to home meetings, to feeding people, and to preaching the gospel. In everything, we act, work, move, and live in the same way. For this, we must be changed. This kind of change is part of our transformation. We need to be transformed in the way that we act, the way that we move, the way that we work, the way that we speak, the way that we have our being, and the way that we meet.</P>
