<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>mm. Four Hundred Pomegranates<br>on the Two Networks</H2><P>Second Chronicles 4:13 says that there were "four hundred pomegranates on the two networks, two rows of pomegranates on each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the pillars" (Heb.). There were four hundred pomegranates on the two networks, with two rows on each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals upon the pillars. Why does it not say that there were three hundred or five hundred pomegranates? The Lord Jesus said that we can bear fruit thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold (Matt. 13:8). The hundredfold increase is the highest. Thus, we can express the riches of life a hundredfold. We know that the number four signifies us, the human creatures. The hundredfold expression of the riches of life is upon the creatures. That the four hundred pomegranates were arranged in two rows on each of the two pillars indicates a testimony. We must be strong, not simply in declaring that we are the testimony of Jesus, but in having a testimony by living. We need a testimony of the experience of the riches of the life of Christ four hundredfold. Although we may have problems in the church life, in our work, and at home, we also have the life of the lily, which, in the Bible, signifies a life lived by trusting in God. The Lord knows that I daily have one problem after another. If we live by ourselves, we cannot bear these problems. But we are lilies among thorns (S.S. 2:2). The thorns are just the problems. Our wife, children, grandchildren, the elders, and the co-workers are all "thorns." Although I am surrounded by so many "thorns," I praise the Lord that I am still living. I have not been "thorned" to death. I am living today, not like a giant, but like a lily. I do not live by my ability, but by faith in my God. I am simply a lily among thorns. The more thorns there are, the better, because the thorns give the opportunity for the Lord's ability to be expressed. We are different from the worldly people, who have no God in whom to trust.</P><P>Many seeking Christians are looking for a church life that is heavenly in every respect. They want everyone in this heavenly church life to be an angel. I am not imagining this; I have actually met people like this. Many of these seeking ones have traveled from "church" to "church" in pursuit of such a heavenly "church." If they find one, their heavenly "church" is soon exposed to be more than earthly. The way to determine whether or not a church is proper is mainly by the ground of the church, not by our measure of the heavenliness of the church. Today on earth there is not an angelic, heavenly church. Shortly after coming into the church life, you will find yourself in the midst of "thorns" and you will say, "I thought everyone here was an angel. But now I see that many of them are not angels but thorns. I cannot bear this." Although I may be a "thorn" to you, you also are a "thorn" to me. Eventually, we "thorn" one another and love one another. This "thorning" helps us grow. During the past three years in Anaheim, this "thorning" has helped us to grow. If everything in the church were smooth and angelic, there would be no testimony of the riches of life.</P>
