   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BREATHING THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What we are speaking about is not anything superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are talking about a divine fact.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through redemption and by regeneration, we have the Triune God living in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Triune God within us is more real than the air we breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no need for us to fast or cry to the Lord in order to receive the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we breathe in air to maintain our physical life, we simply need to breathe in the Triune God in order to experience His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Paul s word in Romans 10, the word is near us, in our mouth and in our heart v. 8 . In 10:12 Paul says, The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we simply need to call on the name of the Lord, and He will be rich to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The air is available for us all to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By breathing in the air, we are enriched by it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In a similar way, by calling on the name of the Lord, we are enriched by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>SATURATED WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because redemption has been accomplished and the blood of Christ has been sprinkled upon the propitiation cover, as believers in Christ we have the Triune God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need for us to fast or wait in order to experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We simply need to say, Lord, I thank You for Your provision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I thank You for the blood and for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I also thank You, Lord, for being so real within me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you pray like this, the divine dispensing will take place within you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through this dispensing you will be saturated with the Triune God, and in this way your whole being will be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this dispensing we are soaked with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as we believe in the Lord Jesus, call on His name, and apply His redeeming blood to our situation, we may experience this divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord s salvation is not a matter of ethical improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Confucius is one who taught people to improve themselves by developing something within them called the bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Lord s salvation is not a matter of improvement, cultivation, or development of a so-called bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, the Lord s desire is that we enjoy what He has accomplished for us and what He is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>ENJOYING THE INDWELLING TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having passed through this process, He is now in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, through His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we may now enjoy what He has accomplished through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and enjoy Him as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is to enjoy Him as the indwelling Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah, the Spirit of God dwells in us!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to Romans 8, the Spirit of Christ and Christ are also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a fact that, according to 8:11, the Spirit of the One who raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a glorious fact this is!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now what do we need to do?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not need to do anything except enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us enjoy what He has accomplished, what He has obtained, and what He has attained.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us enjoy all that Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is our redemption and sanctification, our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is our food, our drink, our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is living, rich, and subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the One we experience and enjoy through the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through the Lord s dispensing we have the cleansing of the Lord s blood and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this dispensing we have the element of sanctification, the very substance of the holiness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this dispensing we also have the divine life, the divine love, and the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we have all the divine virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How marvelous that these divine virtues are in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit!</S>
