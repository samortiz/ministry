   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THREE PARTS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONSCIENCE, FELLOWSHIP, AND INTUITION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is interesting to note that there are three persons in the Godhead, three parts to man s being, three inward parts to the soul, and also three parts to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All are in three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Scriptures also reveal three parts in the tabernacle, the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Three is the basic figure or number.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even in Noah s ark there were three levels.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the tabernacle the number three is used many times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, the width of one board was one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When two boards were joined as a pair, the total width was three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that the number three signifies a whole unit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the spirit is a complete unit, composed of three parts, or functions: conscience, fellowship, and intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The shaded area in the diagram below illustrates the parts of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is easy to understand the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are all familiar with this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To perceive right from wrong is one function of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To condemn or to justify is another one of its functions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is also easy to comprehend the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fellowship is our communion with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Within our spirit such a function makes it possible for us to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a simple word, fellowship is to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But it is not easy to understand the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Intuition means to have a direct sense or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is such a direct sense in our spirit, regardless of reason, circumstances, or background.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a sense without reason, a sense that is not reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a direct sense of God and a direct knowledge from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This function of the spirit is what we call the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the spirit is known by the functions of the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But these three parts in the human spirit must be proven from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First of all, the conscience is found in Romans 9:1: My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By comparing Romans 9:1 with Romans 8:16, it is evident that the conscience is located in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On one hand, the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit; on the other hand, our conscience bears witness in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This proves that the conscience must be a function of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Corinthians 5:3 the apostle Paul says that in his spirit he judged a sinful person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To judge means either to condemn or to justify, which are acts of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fact that the apostle judged in his spirit confirms that the condemning or justifying function is in the spirit; hence, the conscience is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Psalm 51:10 speaks of a right spirit within me ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A right spirit is a spirit that is right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Knowing right from wrong is related to the conscience; thus, this verse also proves that the conscience is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalm 34:18 refers to those who are contrite in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be contrite means to realize that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, it is to accuse and condemn ourselves, which is a function of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows that the conscience is related to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Deuteronomy 2:30 says that God hardened the spirit of Sihon the king of Heshbon, which means that Sihon s conscience was hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be hardened in the spirit means to be careless with regard to the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we cast off the feeling in our conscience, we become hardened in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These verses offer the strongest ground for the fact that the function of the conscience is in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us go on to find the scriptural ground for saying that the fellowship is a part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First of all, John 4:24 tells us that we must worship God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, to worship God requires us to worship in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To worship God is to contact God and fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This verse proves that the function of worship, or of fellowship, is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Romans 1:9 the apostle Paul said, I serve God in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To serve God also is a kind of fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This too proves that the function of fellowship is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Romans 7:6 Paul added that we serve in newness of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In other words, our service to the Lord is essentially our fellowship with the Lord in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let us consider Ephesians 6:18.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this verse Paul says that we should pray at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no article before spirit, nor is the word capitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The word spirit here does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To pray is to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To pray in spirit indicates, then, that fellowship with God is a matter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Luke 1:47 Mary said, My spirit has exulted in God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To exult in God means that the human spirit has contacted God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once again, this verse indicates that fellowship with God is a function of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In addition, Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This verse is very clear, because it shows that fellowship with God must be both in our spirit and in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Real fellowship means that we become one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This fellowship is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The above verses are sufficient to prove that the function of fellowship is in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Now let us consider the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although it is difficult to find the scriptural ground for this function, there are some verses.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>First Corinthians 2:11 reveals that the spirit of man can know what the soul cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our spirit can discern that which the soul cannot discern.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This proves that something extra is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our soul can know things by reason and by circumstantial experiences, but the human spirit can discern things without these.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This direct sense in the spirit shows that the intuition is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Furthermore, Mark 2:8 says that Jesus knew in His spirit, and Mark 8:12 says that He groaned deeply in His spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>John 11:33 says that Jesus was moved with indignation in His spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To know, to groan, and to be indignant in our spirit come from a direct sense of discernment that is not dependent upon reason.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This we call the intuition, the third function of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now we have the scriptural ground for these six parts: the three parts of the soul and the three parts of the spirit.</S>
