The Spirit is not the last third of God, nor is He just a power, or a dove; He is the Triune God Himself. When you receive the Spirit, you receive the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GOD BEING SPIRIT</H2><P>John 4:24 tells us that "God is Spirit." The Triune God is wholly a matter of Spirit. This refers to God's essence. For example, the essence of a wooden table is wood, so we can say that the table is wood. God's essence is Spirit, so we say God is Spirit. Never think that only one-third of God is Spirit, as some may think. The whole God, the Triune God&#151;Father, Son, and Spirit&#151;is Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SPIRIT BEING SENT BY THE FATHER AND<br>THE SON AND COMING "FROM-WITH" THE FATHER</H2><P>In John 14:26 the Lord (the Son) said, "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, Whom the Father will send in My name." Also, in John 15:26 the Lord said, "But when the Comforter comes, Whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality Who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me." First in 14:26 He says that the Father will send the Spirit; later in 15:26 He says that the Son Himself will send the Spirit. Then who sent the Spirit&#151;the Father or the Son? We must say that the Spirit was sent by both the Father and the Son because, as we saw in the last lesson, the Father and the Son are one. The Father's sending is the Son's sending, and the Son's sending is the Father's sending. The Two are one. The Holy Spirit is sent not only by the Father but also "from-with" the Father. You should have learned from Lesson Three that the Greek word for "from" means "by the side of," and often means "from-with." When the Father sends the Spirit, He comes with the Spirit. The Spirit comes from the Father and with the Father. When the Father sends the Spirit, He comes with the Spirit. The Father is the source. The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son, so when the Spirit comes, the Father and Son also come. The whole Triune God comes. </P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
