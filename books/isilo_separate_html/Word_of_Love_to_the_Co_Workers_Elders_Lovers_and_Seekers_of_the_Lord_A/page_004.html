I was one of these children. My mother was not saved; she was merely nominal, but when she was young, she stayed with her grandfather who was a good Southern Baptist, and he sent her to study at a Southern Baptist school. Because of this, she was one hundred percent for Christianity. In our home she taught us stories from the Gospels. She had printed tracts pasted on the wall. That was very unusual in our country. When we were growing up, she wanted us to go to her church. She washed our clothes for us on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, she prepared better meals on that day, and she brought us to her church. She was not saved, yet my second sister got saved, then I, and then my younger brother. Three of her children were not only saved but also became seeking Christians.</p><p>I have seen many devoted Christians. Among them, one was Brother Nee. Not all of Brother Nee&rsquo;s brothers were properly saved. Brother Nee&rsquo;s mother was a sister who loved the Lord very much. It is no wonder that she would weep for her sons. I have seen many others like this. Even among us there are many good sisters who love the Lord very much and pray for their children nearly every day, even though their children do not believe. On the other hand, some parents are not so devoted, yet their children love the Lord. Eventually, I have bowed down before the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s word is true. We should raise up our children according to the Lord&rsquo;s teaching. This is our duty and we should do it, but eventually their salvation and seeking of the Lord depend upon God&rsquo;s eternal choosing and predestination. If our raising of our children could decide their spiritual future, this would be against God&rsquo;s predestination.</p><p>Isaac brought forth two sons as twins. One was Esau and the other was Jacob. The Bible says clearly in Malachi 1:2-3, &ldquo;I loved Jacob; but Esau I hated.&rdquo; This creates a very big problem in theology. For this reason there is Calvinist theology and Arminian theology. The former says that our salvation is up to God&rsquo;s choosing, and the latter says that our salvation is our responsibility and according to our endeavoring. The Arminians say that we can be saved in the morning and lost in the evening. The Pentecostals are Arminians, while the Presbyterians are Calvinists. The Lutherans also teach that salvation is not up to us. Whether we go to the theater or whatever we do, as long as we have been chosen, our eternal security is fixed because it depends upon God&rsquo;s choosing. One day a student came to D. L. Moody, the American evangelist who founded the Moody Bible Institute, saying, &ldquo;I dare not to go out to get people saved because I am afraid that someone may be saved whom God did not choose.&rdquo; Moody answered, &ldquo;On the outside lintel above the gate into heaven it is written, &lsquo;Whosoever will may come,&rsquo; but on the inside it says, &lsquo;Chosen before the foundation of the world.&rsquo; &rdquo; It is difficult to say who is chosen. We simply must do our duty to raise up our children according to the teaching of the Lord. Whether or not they have been chosen is not up to us. Some may say, &ldquo;Because it is not up to us, we need not do much.&rdquo; However, this also is wrong.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF REGULATIONS<br />IN CORPORATE LIVING</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Exercising Demands through Regulations</h2><p>According to my observation in Taipei, it is better not to exercise any demand on the young people who live in our brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes. We have to realize that the arrangement of these homes is to bring people to the Lord and to gain them, just as the Lord came to seek the lost sheep. The Lord comes to seek the lost sheep, not the good sheep. Therefore, the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes should have no regulations. To save sinners we also should not have regulations. As long as we have regulations, we regulate people away. We thank the Lord that we have the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes as &ldquo;fishing hooks,&rdquo; and some young people have been hooked. It is not so easy for us to hook a person, so if we have regulations, they will keep people away. The brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes may have a regulation that says everyone must return home and turn off their lights by 10:00 P.M., but some young ones may be excluded by this regulation. What shall we do? Should we have no regulation about the time to sleep? We should have a proper kind of regulation, but we should make it clear to the young ones that this kind of regulation is to help them to have a proper physical life. We hope that they would keep the proper regulation, but it is not something legal. In the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes, nothing should be legal. There should be freedom, not legality.</p><p>Some may ask, &ldquo;If the young people do not return before 10:00 P.M., what shall we do?&rdquo; For this, we need shepherding. According to the principle in Ephesians 5, the Lord shepherds us by cherishing us and nourishing us (v. 29). We have to shepherd the young ones by cherishing and nourishing them. This requires that we spend time with them. The co-workers may not have much time, but they should train some students who live in our brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes so that two or three will become their helpers. They have to carry out the shepherding with love. Do not condemn the young ones. Do not say, &ldquo;Since you have broken the rule, you cannot stay here&rdquo; and simply look on as they leave. We have to shepherd them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
