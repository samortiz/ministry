<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SIXTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM</h1><h1 class="title">(6)</h1><p>In this message we shall continue our consideration of the parable for faithfulness (25:14-30).</p><h2 class="head3">7. The Lord of the Slaves Coming<br />to Settle Accounts with Them</h2><p>Verse 19 says, &ldquo;Now after a long time the lord of those slaves comes and settles accounts with them.&rdquo; A long time signifies the entire church age, and the coming signifies the Lord&rsquo;s coming to the air (1 Thes. 4:16) in His parousia. To settle accounts signifies the Lord&rsquo;s judgment at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10) in the air (within His parousia), where the believers&rsquo; life, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment (1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 3:13-15).</p><h2 class="head3">8. The Five-talented and the Two-talented Ones Both Receiving a Reward</h2><p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;And he who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents.&rdquo; The coming of the five-talented one refers to the coming to the judgment seat of Christ. Gaining another five talents is the result of the full use of the gift of the five talents.</p><p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.&rdquo; The &ldquo;few things&rdquo; signify the Lord&rsquo;s work in this age, &ldquo;over&rdquo; signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and the &ldquo;many things&rdquo; signify the responsibilities in the coming kingdom. The joy of the Lord signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom. This is the inward satisfaction, not the outward position. To participate in the Lord&rsquo;s joy is the greatest reward, better than the glory and position in the kingdom. Here we see two aspects of the reward given to the faithful slave: authority and enjoyment. The faithful will enter directly into the Lord&rsquo;s presence in the manifestation of the kingdom.</p><p>The same reward is given to the two-talented one as to the five-talented one. When the two-talented one came and said that he had gained another two talents, the Lord said the same thing to him that He had said to the five-talented one (vv. 22-23). Although the gift given to the twotalented one is smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord&rsquo;s appraisal and reward to both are the same. This indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s appraisal and reward are not related to the size and quantity of our work, but to our faithfulness in using His gift to the fullest extent. The same appraisal and reward would also have been given to the one-talented one if he had been as faithful.</p>
