   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE ONE IN:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TEACHING 1 Cor 4:17; 7:17; 16:1; Acts 2:42; Rom 16:17; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3; Eph 4:13-14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>PRACTICE 1 Cor 11:16; 14:33b-34</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THINKING, SPEAKING Phil 2:2; 4:2; 1 Cor 1:10; Rom 15:6</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ESSENCE, APPEARANCE, EXPRESSION Rev 1:11-12</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE DOCTRINAL ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The verses listed above show us a oneness in seven aspects: teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These aspects are not a doctrinal oneness, but a oneness in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are another seven items concerning our oneness in doctrine: one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one church, one recovery, one testimony, and one work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first three ones are the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nearly all of us would agree with the seven aspects of oneness on the doctrinal side.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If anyone would have a dissenting spirit, mind, or attitude concerning these seven aspects of the doctrinal oneness, it might be concerning the last one the work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may say that the work belongs either to doctrine or to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I like to classify the work on the doctrinal side because through my continuous observation I have discovered that few among us would dare to say that they are doing a work separate from the unique work for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all agree with this sevenfold oneness doctrinally concerning the one God, the one Lord, the one Spirit, the one church, the one recovery, and the one work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among the many denominations and groups in Christianity, none would dare to say that they have two Gods, two Lords, or two Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They would argue doctrinally, however, concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They would say that we are all one church, but that in practice it is impossible to have one church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To them it is necessary to have many churches the Chinese church in the Philippines, in Malaysia, in Indonesia, in Thailand, and in California, and even the Anglican church in China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I was a young boy, I wondered how the church of England could be in China.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The various denominations and other groups in Christianity do not have the standing to proclaim one church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They have to admit to having different churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Arminian, and Protestant churches are the four major groups.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some among the Protestant churches are named after a leader such as the Lutheran and Wesleyan churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every kind of denomination bears its own testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Baptist church testifies for baptism by immersion, and the Presbyterian church bears the testimony of their presbytery system to manage and administrate their churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Episcopal churches bear a testimony of controlling their churches by a hierarchy of bishops bishop, from Latin episcopus .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This hierarchy also was adopted by the Catholic church, which has the pope at the top of its hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of all these different testimonies, there are spontaneously different kinds of works.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are different churches with different testimonies by different works.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not admit that there are many churches in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All those churches are not churches in reality but denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are denominated sects.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are not the testimony of Jesus which John refers to in Revelation 1:2, 9; 12:17; 19:10; 20:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the Bible, we can only recognize that there is one church, with one testimony by one recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to admit to there being one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one church, one testimony, and one recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Also, it is impossible for us to have more than one work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There must be one work on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE PRACTICAL ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I fully realize that there is nearly no problem among us concerning these seven aspects of the doctrinal oneness, but I also realize that we do have problems concerning the sevenfoldness of the practical oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am concerned that not many of us have thought about the seven aspects of the practical oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I believe that the people in the recovery are thoughtful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the recovery there should not be anyone who is unreasonable, illogical, unthoughtful, or unfair.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As those who are reasonable, logical, thoughtful, and fair, I would ask you to consider these seven aspects listed at the beginning of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible tells us we need to be one in teaching, practice, speaking, and even thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some may feel that this is too much and that this is the controlling of people s thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may feel that this is not workable in such a democratic age, especially in a country like the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Americans practice democracy and grow up in an environment where nearly everybody expresses his own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>None of us should follow the recovery blindly, foolishly, or ignorantly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need a sober consideration of the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One may consider that to be one in speaking is somewhat against the First Amendment of freedom of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you want to remain in your status as an American citizen, you are through with the recovery because the recovery does not practice many speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The recovery only allows one kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have a question as to whether or not we in the recovery are really one in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The last three items we need to be one in practically are related to the golden lampstands in Revelation 1:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The seven lampstands do not have more than one essence and one substance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The pure gold is the unique substance of the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Within one substance there can only be one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the lampstands should furthermore be one in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At this point in the Lord s recovery, I seriously question whether all the churches have the same appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The lampstands all have one substance, which is gold, and they all have one form, one shape.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The seven lampstands are identical in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do not number them, it is impossible to tell them apart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They all look exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Brethren insisted on having separated local assemblies, and they even taught that all the local assemblies should not resemble one another to encourage them to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>That was their boast.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sometimes they purposely practiced something to show people that one assembly was different from another.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They wanted to show people that they were not catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They said that the churches having a uniform appearance was something of the Catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They say that the churches should be different based upon the fact that each epistle to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 is different from the others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All seven epistles are different from one another, but they are different in negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The particular characteristic of the church in Ephesus was the loss of the first love 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The church in Pergamos became worldly; worldliness was their particular characteristic 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The specific, particular characteristics of the apostate church in Thyatira were Jezebel, idol worship, fornication, and adultery 2:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The characteristic of the church in Sardis was deadness 3:1 , and the characteristic of the church in Laodicea was lukewarmness 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The churches are different from one another in negative things, but the lampstands in Revelation 1, among whom Christ as the Head was walking, are altogether identical.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They all look the same.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They are uniquely one in their essence, in their appearance, in their form, and in their expression.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Each lampstand has seven lamps to express it, and all the seven expressions are uniquely identical.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do we follow the negative side or do we stand for the positive side?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Based upon the wrong teaching of the Brethren, their assemblies are encouraged to have different appearances.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This kind of poison may still remain unconsciously or subconsciously in the minds of some of us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some may doubt or question the fact that the appearance of the churches should be the same, thinking that we are going to unify all the local churches to carry on a kind of so-called catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>My burden is to look into the real situation in the Lord s recovery regarding the practices.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to study this.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We are not carrying out the Lord s recovery in a way to blind people s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are doing our best to open everyone s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I have been kept in the recovery for over half a century with much consideration and observance.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you believe the Bible, you have to admit that we should be one in teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There is not a verse in the Bible that even gives us a small hint that allows the churches to have different appearances.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Some may say that God does not care for the appearance, but Paul tells us to abstain from the appearance, from the form, of evil 1 Thes 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Even in sinful things God takes care of the appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If a brother stays in a closed, dark, and even locked room with a female for three hours, he may still declare he has a pure conscience and is not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God knows the heart, but other people do not.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Because God cares for the appearance, He tells us to abstain from every form of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God not only cares for the essential and substantial reality of the lampstand but also for its shape, its form.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It has to be in the shape of a lamp; otherwise, it cannot be called the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The recovery must have a proper appearance; otherwise, it is not the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The recovery does not have a creed.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>From the very beginning of the Lord s recovery in mainland China, Brother Nee declared that the Bible with its sixty-six books was our creed.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The recovery does not have different, single doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It only has one whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We have come back to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>There were two slogans practiced by the Brethren in their early days back to the Body and back to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>They used these slogans but did not practice them in full.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then they set up their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We do not like to set up our teachings, but we like to open up the pure Word of God to the Lord s people.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The local churches having one appearance today is doubtful and questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I also have a question concerning the churches bearing one expression.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>What kind of expression do the brothers from Germany, England, Brazil, and Taiwan see when they come to the churches in the United States?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Do they see the same one expression?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If they do not, we are not properly compressed into the golden lampstands because all seven lampstands bear one, unique expression.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>There is no difference at all between the expression of these seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Their expressions are also uniquely identical.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I heard from some that certain places in the United States have different tastes and different colors.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we have different colors and tastes, we unconsciously annul what we proclaim to be.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I want to have a thorough fellowship with you concerning what I have seen in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Many of you can testify that the recovery I brought to the United States was altogether one in teaching, in practice, in thinking, in speaking, in essence, in appearance, and in expression.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Although we are not promoting a so-called catholic church, the denotation, connotation, and significance of the word catholic is altogether proper.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The word catholic, however, was damaged and applied wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We are not promoting anything of that kind of apostate Catholic church, but we are here carrying out the Lord s recovery of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>According to our over sixty years of study, the proper church life has to be one in teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>You may proclaim that what you do and what you stand for is the recovery, but the way of your thinking, speaking, practice, appearance, and expression annuls your declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>It does not confirm your declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The recovery does not bear more than one expression.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>What do people see, taste, and smell when they come to your locality?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>When some rose up to oppose the ministry in 1959 in Taiwan, I told them that I sacrificed my whole life for the way of the Lord s recovery and would never change my way.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I told them that if they did not feel that this was the right way, they should take their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I also said that they should not remain in the recovery pretending to be something.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>At that time, I was giving a message on John 2 where the Lord told the Jews, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up v. 19 . I told the saints that if this is my work it has to be torn down, but if this is the work of the Lord you cannot tear it down.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The more you tear down this work, the more this work will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>It has been twenty-seven years since I spoke that word, and history has shown that those who opposed the ministry were divided again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I warned them that if they would not take my word, they would be divided endlessly, and this has been the history.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>The work of the Lord s recovery, though, on the island of Taiwan has been solidly founded and very much blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>I cannot protect the Lord s divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Only He Himself can do that.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>What I can do is to bring the recovery to you all and tell you the truth concerning the different aspects of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>This is my word of love, my word of warning.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>As those who are taking care of the churches and participating in the recovery, you have to realize the recovery of the genuine church life is altogether, absolutely, wholly, and ultimately one in teaching, in practice, in thinking, in speaking, in essence, in appearance, and in expression.</S>
