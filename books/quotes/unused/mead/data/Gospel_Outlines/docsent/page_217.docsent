   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only He who is qualified to condemn is qualified to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, only God can forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The basis of God s forgiveness The forgiveness of God is based upon Christ s redemption and is executed through His righteousness.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The completeness of God s forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because Christ s redemption is complete and eternal, God s forgiveness is also complete and eternal.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE BELIEVER Scripture: Acts 10:43; 26:18; Rom 6:7; 8:1-2 How can man be freed from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ has accomplished redemption and God has promised forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So now, if a man believes, he can be freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be freed from sin has two meanings To be freed from sin means to be freed from sinful acts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This also means that the history of sins is erased and the judgment on sins is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be freed from sin means to be freed from the nature of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is because the power of sin is broken and the pains of sin are over.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once a man believes and is freed from sin, he is immediately justified Subject Two Hundred Twenty-six THE ONE WHO BEARS SIN SATAN Scripture: Matt 25:41; Lev 16:7-10; Rev 20:10 Who should bear sin?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since sin originated with Satan, it should ultimately be borne by him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Satan transmitted sin to man, God sought to remove it from him and to give it back to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To do this the Lord Jesus bore sin for a short while on the cross, but that was only the bearing of man s sentence for sin; sin itself is ultimately and eternally to be borne by Satan alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How sin will be borne Although man was deceived into receiving the burden of sin from Satan s hand, thus becoming a sinner, God has no intention for man to bear sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As soon as a man believes in the redemptive work accomplished by Christ, he is freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he does not believe, he will have to help Satan to bear sin for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus Matthew 25:41 says that the unbelieving ones shall enter into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The lake of fire is not for man, but for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you follow Satan, you will have to share his judgment.</S>
