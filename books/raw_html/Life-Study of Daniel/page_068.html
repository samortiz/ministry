<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Angelic Messenger Returning<br>to Fight with the Evil Prince of Persia</H2><P>In verses 18 through 21 we see more of the spiritual struggle behind the scene. The angelic messenger would return to fight with the evil prince of Persia. The evil prince of Greece was then about to come. No one would hold with the angelic messenger against these two evil princes except Michael, the prince of Israel. The name Michael means "Who is like God?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Angelic Messenger<br>Standing Up to Support and Strengthen Darius</H2><P>In the first year of Darius the Mede, the angelic messenger stood up to support and strengthen Darius (11:1). Darius was strengthened in this way in order to receive the kingdom.</P><P>Before the vision concerning the destiny of Israel was unveiled to Daniel, he was given a vision of the spiritual scene that is behind the physical scene. In this spiritual scene Christ is preeminent. This scene also includes both good and evil spirits, spirits that are engaged in an invisible spiritual war.</P>
