   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE REGENERATION A. To Be Born of Water to Be Convicted concerning Sin and to Repent and Confess Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way the believers experience regeneration has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first aspect is to be born of water John 3:5 by being convicted concerning sin 16:8-11 and by repenting of and confessing our sins Acts 2:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>B. To Be Born of the Spirit to Call on and Receive Christ and to Believe into Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second aspect of the way the believers experience regeneration is to be born of the Spirit John 3:5 by calling on and receiving Christ Rom 10:13; John 1:12 and by believing into Christ 3:36a .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a person hears the gospel, his conscience is touched and he is convicted.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, he repents, confesses his sins, and calls on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once he confesses, prays, and calls on the Lord Jesus, something happens within him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He feels that someone has come into him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Previously he was alone, but now there is another One within him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This One gives him joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This One does not merely change him but transforms him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I was born into Christianity, grew up in Christianity, and was educated in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, I reached the age of nineteen and was still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But one day I heard the gospel, and I could not help but believe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I confessed my sins to the Lord and I prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I became different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I used to like certain things, but after I was saved, I did not like them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time I was only nineteen years old, but I began to love to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I read the Bible constantly from morning until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was ready to go to sleep, I placed my Bible beside my pillow, and I would still read a couple of verses before turning out the light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then when I woke up in the morning, I would reach for my Bible to read.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many of us can give the same kind of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, the Lord Jesus died on the cross for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now He is omnipresent, and He has come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Millions of people can testify to this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1942 we were having a big gospel campaign in the church during the time of the New Year festival in my hometown Chefoo in the province of Shantung.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Someone from Manchuria who was working in the customs office and who made a lot of money came to see me after these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said to me, "Mr. Lee, your messages have clearly shown me all the problems within me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have no questions at all, and I am ready to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please tell me how to believe that I may receive what you have spoken in your messages."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said, "It's very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you go home today, try to find a quiet place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then you pray to the Lord Jesus and confess your sins to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the feeling in your conscience, confess all your sins, one by one, from your youth until now.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end you should call on the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he went home, it was not too late but not that early either.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His wife and children were waiting for him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Formerly, he liked to joke with them, but this day when he came home, he was very solemn and did not joke.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, his wife and children took notice of him, and they saw him enter his bedroom and shut the door.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The children looked through the window and saw him kneeling down and praying there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The next day when he went back to work at the customs office, he was a completely different person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are many such stories.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why was he different?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was different because Someone had entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everyone who is genuinely saved by believing into the Lord Jesus has Someone who entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This One is God, this One is Jesus, and this One is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we are regenerated, we are born of God; that is, God is born into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John 1:12 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These believers are born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are born once of our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, God's original intention was to enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, He redeemed us by dying on the cross for our sins; then He regenerated us by entering into us through His becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, He dwells in us to be our life.</S>
