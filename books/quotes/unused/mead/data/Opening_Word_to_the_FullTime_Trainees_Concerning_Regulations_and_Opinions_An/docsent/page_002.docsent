   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I am burdened to share something with you concerning the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know that it is good for us to be trained to have a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1953 I taught thirty items of a proper character to a group of one hundred twenty trainees in Taipei, Taiwan see the book entitled Character published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These thirty items of human character did not come from my imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They came up in my teaching from my own personal living and personal practice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the Lord's mercy I have learned that these items of a proper character are very crucial in our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in this message we want to focus our attention on a basic factor, that is, the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The life we are concerned with is the divine life mingled with our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are wonderful persons because we were created with the highest life in God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In God's creation there are the plant life, the animal life, and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Genesis 1 you can see these three different levels of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The human life is the highest among the created lives, yet it is not the top life in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The top life in the universe is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter two of Genesis shows the life which is signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That life is a great mystery, yet we know that it is the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus' life is the life of the Triune God, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, we can see that in the universe there are three lives in God's creation, and there is one life which is the uncreated life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible shows that the plant life is for the animal life; both of these lives are for the human life, and the human life is for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many animals live on plants, which indicates that the plant life is for the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the beginning God also intended to have just the plant life for the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the human life became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the fall, God added something to support the human life, that is, the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, after the fall, both the plant life and the animal life are for the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why man eats meat in addition to vegetables and fruit, the things of the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Day by day we are nourished and supplied with the plant life plus the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The plant and animal lives are for the human life, and our human life is for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only is the human life for the divine life but also the divine life is for the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The human life is only for God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That means it is for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also, the divine life is mainly for man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That means it is for the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we see that in the whole universe there are four kinds of lives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not count the angelic life, because it is a subsidiary life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We Christians have the human life mingled with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These two lives are for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we use the simple word life, we are referring to this mingled life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Life denotes the human life for the divine life and the divine life for the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we need to see that in the Greek language of the New Testament, there are three words for life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word for the physical life of our being is bios, from which the word biology comes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psuche, from which the word psychology comes, is used to denote our soulish life, our psychological life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Zoe denotes our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our being is constituted with three parts: body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In each of these parts there is a definite life: the life in our body is bios; the life in our soul is psuche; and the life in our regenerated spirit is zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One is our physical life; the second, in the middle, is the psychological life; and the last one, which is the deepest one in our being, is the spiritual life because it is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are wonderful persons of three parts with three lives.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's intention is for Himself, the divine life, to be mingled with such a wonderful human life.</S>
