   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HEAVENLY ELEMENT OF MANNA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONSTITUTED INTO OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we still need to have the heavenly element added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we have been redeemed, delivered, cleansed, and purified, all this is negative; we do not yet have anything positive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, we are not yet qualified to be God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to be God s habitation, something heavenly must be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we need to eat the heavenly manna and drink the living water so that something heavenly and living might be constituted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we are daily and even hourly eating of the manna and drinking of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more we eat and drink in this way, the less we smell like garlic and the more we smell like manna.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Exodus 16:31 says that the taste of manna was like wafers made with honey.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The taste of manna is sweet; it is heavenly, not worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the heavenly element of manna is constituted into our being, we become qualified to be God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way the tabernacle was erected in the wilderness, and it was filled with the glory of God Exo 40:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>WAFERS OR STONES?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we pointed out in the last message, the tabernacle was good, but it was neither solid nor established.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By eating manna, we become wafers with the taste of honey.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Certain brothers are like sweet wafers: they break when you touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the saints from Germany came to Los Angeles several years ago, they were not the temple; rather, they were the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were all wafers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, since then many of them have become stones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I pour water upon a wafer, the wafer will be ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if I pour water on a stone, the stone will remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I praise the Lord that there are many stones in Stuttgart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that the church in Stuttgart is no longer the tabernacle in the wilderness, but the temple in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some saints in the churches are still eating the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A number of new ones are eating the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are still in the world, not yet in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are some others who are eating manna.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because those who eat manna are wafers, I am very easy on them, and I dare not touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But some of the elders can testify that I am not easy on them because they are stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I pour water upon them, it proves that they are stones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some in the church are eating the Lamb, others are eating the manna, and still others are eating the rich produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>LIVING AND WALKING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is not only the redeeming and nourishing Lamb; He is also the all-inclusive land.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Colossians 2:6 says, As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is the good land in which we may live, walk, and have our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is a sphere, a realm, in which we may dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Colossians 2:7 says that we have been rooted and that we are being built up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Being rooted in Christ is for growth, and being built up in Christ is for building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have been put into the good land of Christ, and now we are the plants growing in this land which is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the Lamb, the manna, and the spacious land with all kinds of produce.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE WATER AND THE FOOD IN THE GOOD LAND</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Christ as our land we have different kinds of water.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Deuteronomy 8:7 speaks of three kinds of water: brooks, fountains, and depths, that is, deep waters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, Deuteronomy 8:8 lists seven types of food: wheat, barley, vines, figs, pomegranates, olive oil, and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the New Testament wheat signifies the incarnated and crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus said, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this verse Christ indicated that He was a grain of wheat falling into the earth to die.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that He was the incarnated and crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first grain to ripen in the holy land is barley.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, barley signifies the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must experience Christ both as the incarnated and crucified One and also as the resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Day by day we may enjoy Christ as two basic items, as wheat and as barley.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is also the wine that makes us happy and stirs us up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is also the fig to satisfy us and to nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Pomegranates signify the expression of the riches of the life of Christ, and the olive oil, the fullness of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All these points are covered in detail in the book The All-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Deuteronomy 8:8 also lists honey along with the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For the most part, honey has to do with the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is derived mainly from flowers and trees.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Of course, a part of the animal life is involved that little animal, the bee.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Without the flowers we cannot have honey, and without the bees we cannot have honey either.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The flowers and the bees cooperate to make honey.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These two lives are mingled together, and honey is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ is both the plant life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The plant life is the generating life, and the animal life is the redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The plant life has no blood, but it generates and multiplies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only the animal life has the blood for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, Christ is not only the generating life, but also the redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Daily we need to enjoy Christ as the incarnated One, the crucified One, and the resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then we shall have the wine to make us happy and to cheer us up.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will bring the satisfaction of the fig tree, the expression of the riches of life, and the fullness of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When all these are combined with Christ s redeeming life, we have the sweet honey.</S>
