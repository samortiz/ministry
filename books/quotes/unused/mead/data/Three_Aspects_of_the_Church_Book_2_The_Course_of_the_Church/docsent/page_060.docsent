   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF DIRECT REVELATION FROM GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A person who has truly been called does not need to study theology.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Over the past twenty or thirty years, the Lord has raised up many people who never studied theology.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most of those who have studied theology have no spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Organized Christianity considers pastoring a profession and theology a skill.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The study of theology is treated as if a person is equipping himself with a skill in order to engage in a certain profession; someone who wants to be a doctor studies medicine, and someone who wants to be a pastor studies theology.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yenching University, Chi-lu University, and St. John s University all have theological seminaries; moreover, there are many schools that teach theology exclusively.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The thought is that in order to be a pastor, one must first study theology.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the Lord raised us up, there was a testimony that believers could receive revelation directly from God and do not need to study theology.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE RECOVERY OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee told us that 1928 was a year of strong recoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although there were many recoveries in the beginning in 1920, we still had not recovered the matter of spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Spiritual warfare was not recovered until the first overcomer conference in 1928.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The messages in that conference were on God s eternal purpose, the kingdom of God, and the way to deal with God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time the matter of spiritual warfare was recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE RECOVERY OF TAKING CHRIST AS THE CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND OF THE OVERCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In early 1934, in the third overcomer conference, Brother Nee shared on Christ as God s centrality and universality and on God s overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The messages in this conference were very high, and they released a great recovery to the brothers and sisters in China.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE RECOVERY OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the three years from 1934 to 1936, we emphasized the matter of the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE RECOVERY OF</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the past we were not clear concerning the spreading of the church from Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This light did not become clear to us until 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE RECOVERY OF KNOWING THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We began to see the matter of knowing the Body in 1938 and 1939.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OF SERVICE IN COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1939 and 1940, after we began to know the Body, we started to see the service in coordination in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE RECOVERY OF</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The matter of the church preaching the gospel was completely recovered in the years between 1940 and 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This recovery reached its peak in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever the church preached the gospel, it involved all the saints moving together; that was a living and strong recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The best time period was in 1942 and 1943, when the entire church preached the gospel; everyone opened his home for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The entire church served in all aspects of the gospel work, including inviting friends, visiting people, and leading people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time the gospel was countless times stronger than it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE RECOVERY OF MIGRATION</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the beginning of 1943 we saw the light of migration; the gospel spreads not only through the preaching of the apostles but also through the migration of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wherever the saints go, the gospel is planted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE RECOVERY OF</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>EXPERIENCING THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The recovery of experiencing the indwelling Christ began after 1942 and continued through the end of the Sino-Japanese War.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The experience of the indwelling Christ is deeper than knowing the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many brothers and sisters went through trials during the war and learned these lessons very well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although they had known the overcoming life and recognized Christ as life in their being, their experience was not up to the standard of experiencing the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everyone, especially some weighty brothers and sisters, passed through trials at the end of the war, and in many places the work stopped completely.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, many brothers and sisters pursued the inner fellowship with the Lord and learned to experience the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, after the war ended, many messages spontaneously emphasized this matter.</S>
