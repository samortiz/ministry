   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 13:"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the prophets prophesied until John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John did not prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, he pointed out the Lord to people, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is where his greatness lies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was great with respect to the time that he was in; his opportunity was different from that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"He who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This does not mean that John's faith, morality, spirituality, conduct, and work were small and that he could not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, it is because those who are in the kingdom of the heavens can say that the work of Christ has been accomplished and that the High Priest has died.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet John was in the city of refuge waiting for the death of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was the reason that he was the least.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was also a matter of a difference in dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus we see: 1 the prophets prophesied that the Savior was coming; 2 John pointed out the Savior in person to people; and 3 Christians have the Savior, whose work is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible the kingdom of the heavens refers to the part of the millennium that is related to reward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, it is the reigning as kings for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The kingdom of the heavens is the manifestation of God's heavenly rule on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is difficult is determining the time interval between the future kingdom of the heavens and the present kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ordinarily, if we do not make a comparison, we cannot fully know a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Comparison brings forth knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The scope of the church today is the same as the scope of the kingdom of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The scope of the kingdom of the heavens is smaller than both the scope of the kingdom of God and the scope of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The scope in which God gives grace to men is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, it is a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kingdom of God is the sovereignty of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All who believe in the Lord are subject to the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is for both now and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the church and the kingdom of God are likened to the two sides of the backbone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The kingdom of the heavens points to the coming millennium, in which a group of people will reign as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not all who are in the church and in the kingdom of God today can enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only the excellent ones can enter in. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were not in the dispensation of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their reclining at table in the kingdom of the heavens probably refers to the enjoyment of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 14:"And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What God had prepared for man He presented before man to allow man to make the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The kingdom of God is of two aspects: 1 the spiritual sphere and 2 the coming kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verses 15-19:John came in the way of mourning, whereas Christ came in the way of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Jews showed no response or sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord showed us that both ways were rejected by the Jews: 1 In His righteousness God called them to repent, but they would not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2 In His grace God called them to receive Christ, but they refused.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John said that God hated sinners, but men did not feel sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord said that God loves sinners, but men did not feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Wisdom is justified by her works."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the word works, some ancient authorities read children.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wisdom is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the Christ on the earth, not the Christ in heaven; this is Christ incarnated, not Christ the eternal Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is Christ after His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The children of wisdom are the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who receive this wisdom are those who justify God's saving way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's saving way is justified by all who receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 20:"Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His works of power took place, because they did not repent."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The time for doing works of power and preaching the gospel cannot last for long.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there is no repentance, reproach will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verses 21-22:In the day of judgment, many people will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How much they will suffer will be different, and the punishment they suffer will also be different.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For those who have had more opportunities, the punishment will be heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verses 23-24:Until now, Capernaum is still in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are two different explanations concerning Capernaum, but regardless of which is correct, God's work is not seen among them today, and they are all like dead ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The purpose of chapter eleven is revealed in the last section.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The history of the Lord's being rejected can be seen at the end of chapter nine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In chapter ten the Lord declared His rejection by men, for He was reviled and called Beelzebul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Chapter eleven speaks concerning how the Lord especially gained a remnant, and the end of chapter twelve records that the Lord was again rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After chapter thirteen, the line of doctrine is not as clear as the preceding twelve chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, the Lord was the son of David; His first relationship was with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then, He was also the son of Abraham; hence, He also had a relationship with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Gospel of Matthew was written to the Jews, but it was not for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Matthew's record is according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It recorded the small points with the main subject in view.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Mark's record is according to history, but the emphasis is on Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Luke's record is according to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>John's record is according to history, yet the emphasis is on Galilee.</S>
