N. Darby. Originally, it had thirteen stanzas. Here it has seven stanzas. The whole hymn is a praise and also a poem. The first stanza and the last stanza seem to stand apart from the rest of the hymn.</p><p>The first stanza opens with "Hark!'' It is beckoning us to hear a voice. This hymn starts with a voice.</p><p>The second stanza tells us what one hears. It is the song of the heavenly chorus. The third line of this stanza says, "Loud and far each tongue partaking.'' This makes reference to every tongue in Philippians 2:11. The voice here is not just the voice of the redeemed, but the voice of the whole heaven plus the heavenly hosts.</p><p>Stanza three speaks of "every knee.'' "Each tongue'' in stanza two matches the "Lamb,'' while "every knee'' in stanza three matches "the Father's throne.'' All the praises are directed first to the Son and then to the Father. This is why stanza four speaks of the Father. In stanza five, the Spirit also comes in. With the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the creation can rest in repose. Darby's hymns have one feature: all of them express a yearning for rest.</p><p>Stanza six turns to us. The first few stanzas give a high praise, and the whole creation is sustained in this praise. If others were to write this hymn, they would have stopped at stanza five. But Darby went on to speak about us.</p><p>Stanza seven goes back to the praise in stanza one. In stanza one, the first "Hark!'' holds us up in heaven. In stanza seven, there is another "Hark!'' "Again'' in the first line of stanza seven is an echo of the first stanza. In lines three and four, there are two "amens.'' These two "amens'' are placed in an excellent place. The second "amen'' echoes the first "amen,'' just as the last stanza echoes the first stanza. In this way, the hymn reads like a poem.</p><p>Every hymn has to ascend in its sentiments. There should be a line through which one can trace the thoughts. If it is not ascending, or if the line stops abruptly, it will not be a good hymn. In the Psalms, there are songs of degrees, which means songs of ascent. If a hymn is not well written, it will become a song of descent. We can only meet God by ascending all the time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_125.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_127.html">Next</a> </body></html>
