   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DISPENSATIONAL MOVES IN THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After creation, life went on in a very ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then God began with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God laid hold of Abraham and Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He wanted a nation, but He began with just two people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God worked on these two, choosing them from out of all the other nations to produce a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abraham left his kindred and country.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Abraham was greater than Abel, Enoch, and Noah because of God's choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was as if these earlier men were quite ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They had no dispensational value to God, but Abraham did.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then God said that his seed would go into Egypt and remain there for four hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was God's next move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God laid hold of Joseph, not his brothers, and took him to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Joseph ruled in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's actions were meant for good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Joseph was an overcomer in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He showed forth his power in the kingdom and showed forth his knowledge of God through dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God had made a dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He put an overcomer in Egypt; He did not put someone who could be defeated there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a principle of God's working.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After four hundred years, it was time for them to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that point God laid hold of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without the events in the first few chapters of Exodus, there never would have been an exodus from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moses came out of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He had an exodus from water.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then he had an exodus from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moses was triumphant over death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God chose him to deal with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moses dwelt in the palace, which was the Egypt of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only did his spirit leave Egypt, but his body left Egypt as well; therefore, God chose him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who can only say, "Go," but not "Come," will have no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All of God's dispensational moves are based on one man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a principle of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the nation of Israel wanted a king, the people chose Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was a head taller than all the other men, but all of his ability was in his head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, God chose His own king David.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even when he was in the wilderness caring for the sheep, he was a king.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not run when a lion came but went against it in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fear is not a kingly attitude, but when Goliath came, Saul was fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In contrast, David trusted in the Lord and went to fight against Goliath.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whoever is truly a king can be a king in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later, David became a servant of Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Saul became his enemy, David even had an opportunity to kill him, but he did not.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whoever cannot control himself is not worthy to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was no king of Israel greater than David.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only he was called King David, because he had dispensational value to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Israel was taken into captivity for seventy years, God still had a dispensational move for Israel because of Nehemiah; he was a true overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even as he was serving a foreign king, he was preparing to go back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was not touched by Shushan and the affairs of the palace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because God gained Nehemiah, He could make a dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the beginning of the New Testament, a group of special people were waiting in Jerusalem for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Anna, Simeon, and all those Luke 2:38 were waiting for redemption in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Their waiting brought in the fullness of the time, the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God will not do things automatically; He will wait for His children to work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord has two works on earth: redemption and building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church is built on "this rock" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The apostles were the first to stand on this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even though they were weak in the flesh, their spirits were not weak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because of this the twelve apostles have a special position not even Paul is reckoned with them; they were a dispensational instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul said that he was less than the least of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The apostles and disciples waited for ten days, praying in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They might have said, "We have a great work to do after these days; we should rest now."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead, they prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There were one hundred and twenty, but where were the others who had followed the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Clearly, not everyone will work with God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These one hundred and twenty were overcomers.</S>
