   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Matthew 19 tells us something further concerning the reigning and ruling aspect of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It tells us that when the Lord Jesus will reign during the millennium, His Apostles such as Peter, James, and John will also reign with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 5, 6, and 7 do not cover the reigning aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They only cover the reality of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In like manner, Matthew 13 does not cover the reigning and the ruling in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it covers the appearance of the kingdom, including a great tree, the tares, and the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in Matthew 19:28 there is something further; that is, when the Lord Jesus comes to be the King, His Apostles will be co-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will not be merely the reality of the kingdom but the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From this we can see that there are three aspects of the kingdom the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew 20 also indicates the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It indicates that during the time when the Lord reigns in His kingdom, some will sit with Him and reign with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not the reality or the appearance of the kingdom, but the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the manifestation of the kingdom, some will reign with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is confirmed by 2 Timothy 2:12 which says that we shall reign with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we come to the last book of the New Testament, Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we see the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seed of the kingdom was sown in Matthew, and the harvest is in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Matthew there is the seed of being co-kings with Christ, and in Revelation there is the harvest of being co-kings with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All those faithful ones, the martyrs, will be raised up, resurrected, and will be co-kings with Christ ruling over the earth for a thousand years 20:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is surely not the appearance or the reality of the kingdom, but the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all need to receive the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We received the gospel of life and the gospel of grace, but we also must receive the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day the kingdom will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether we will be included or shut out of that manifestation is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need to repent and consecrate ourselves to deal with this matter of the kingdom.</S>
