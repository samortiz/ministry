<h2 class="head1">IV. ILLNESS AND GOD'S DISCIPLINE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. God's Disciplining Hand<br />behind Some Sicknesses</h2><p>It is interesting to note that unbelievers often are easily healed, while Christians are not healed so easily. The New Testament shows that when unbelievers went to the Lord, they were healed immediately. The Bible also speaks of the gift of healing. Both believers and unbelievers can be healed through the gift of healing. However, the Bible also shows that some Christians were never healed. Trophimus was one, Timothy was another, and Paul was a third. These three were the best brothers in the New Testament. Paul kept Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick and nothing could be done (2 Tim. 4:20). Paul advised the sick Timothy to take some wine because his stomach was not clean; Timothy was not healed. Even Paul himself suffered and was weak because of an eye disease or some other malady. This is why he said that there was a thorn in his flesh (2 Cor. 12:7). A thorn always irritates people. Even though a thorn is very small, it is very uncomfortable when lodged in the flesh. Even when it is lodged in the little finger, it can be very painful. Paul's thorn was not a small one but a big one. This thorn caused discomfort to his whole body. In verse 9 he used the term weakness, which tells us how much he suffered! These three persons were the best brothers, yet they were never healed. Instead, they bore their illnesses.</p><p>Illnesses are different from sins. Sins cannot yield the fruit of sanctification, whereas illnesses can yield the fruit of sanctification. It is wrong to lump illnesses together with sins. There are some similarities between the two, but there are also many dissimilarities. The more a man sins, the filthier he becomes. But a man does not become filthier by becoming sick. In fact, he can become holy through his sickness, because God's disciplining hand is with his sickness. Sickness can result in discipline. When God's children are sick, they have to learn to submit to God's mighty hand (1 Pet. 5:6).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Accepting the Lesson<br />That Comes with the Illness</h2><p>If you have an illness, you should learn to deal with your problems one by one before the Lord. After you have dealt with them, you may conclude that God's hand is upon you and that He is doing this to stop you from becoming proud and wild like other sinners. You should remember that you must accept not only the illness but also the lesson that comes with this illness. Having an illness alone is useless; you must learn the lesson that comes with the illness. Illness alone cannot sanctify a person; it is the acceptance of the lesson that comes with the illness that sanctifies a person. You must reap the benefit and result that come with the illness. Perhaps God put His hand on you in order to humble you as He did Paul. He prevented Paul from becoming proud through the revelations that he had received. God may allow a sickness in our flesh to soften us because we are too strong in our disposition. These things can explain why He does not heal us immediately. Sickness alone does not profit anyone; only the softening brings the profit. There is no point in being ill all our lives unless the illness will soften us. Many people have been sick all their life, yet they have never been dealt with by the Lord. Such sickness is in vain. Sometimes a person recovers from an illness after a period of time. But even though the sickness is over, the Lord may not let the person go. Other things will come along the way. As soon as one becomes sick, he has to go to the Lord and seek His speaking.</p><p>Often we can identify the Lord's discipline in our sickness. God disciplines many people through their illness and touches them in certain areas.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Sickness Not Being Something Dreadful</h2><p>Never consider sickness to be something dreadful. The "knife" is not in just anyone's hand. If the one who shaves my hair is my brother, I would not be scared even if he used a big knife. But it would be very frightening indeed if I allowed my enemy to cut my hair. We have to ask in whose hand is the knife. I would be scared if the surgeon who operated on me happened to be my enemy. But I would not be scared if the scalpel was in my brother's hand. Please bear in mind that all sicknesses are in God's hand. Many sick brothers and sisters who are so anxious about their health seem to believe that their sicknesses are in the enemy's hand.</p><p>Please remember that every sickness has been measured by God's hand. Satan is the creator of sickness, and I believe that Satan can make people sick. But everyone who has read the book of Job knows that sickness happens only with God's permission. Every sickness is under God's limitation. Job shows us clearly that Satan cannot make a person sick without God's permission and limitation. God's permission and limitation are the abiding factors. Consider Job's case: God allowed him to be sick, but He did not allow his life to be harmed. Whenever we are sick, we should not feel hopeless and we should not worry. Do not insist on being healed. Do not complain that the sickness has continued too long and that you are afraid of death.</p><p>Please bear in mind that sickness is in the hand of God. It is measured by Him and under His limitation. After Job's trials ran their course, the illness went away; the illness accomplished God's purpose in him. In Job's story we see an end to God's discipline (James 5:11). I would like to say that many people's sicknesses do not have a proper ending; they have not learned the lesson. We must realize that all illnesses are in God's hand; they are all measured by the Lord. Often all we have to do is confess our sins, and the matter is over.</p>
