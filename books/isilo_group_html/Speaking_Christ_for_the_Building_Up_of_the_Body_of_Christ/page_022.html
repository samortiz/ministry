<p>If we learn to sense the hymns, we can know their standard. If we sing or read a hymn, we will have a deep sensation. We can sense that #152 is deep, high, and profound. The sensation comes from the thought of the hymn. When we select a hymn for a meeting, we must do it according to our sensation based on the thought of the hymn. The sensation of a hymn also refers to its taste. Whether or not certain foods are delicious is determined by their taste. We want to know the hymns not only in an objective way but also in a subjective way by learning to taste them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORDING OF THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>We also have to discern the wording of the hymns. Hymn #152 was written in Chinese in 1961 and translated into English. Although the English version is very good, the Chinese version is more poetic since it is easier to rhyme words in Chinese than in English. If the rhyme of a hymn is not that good and it is not that poetic, we should not choose it for our meeting. A hymn without rhyme sounds ugly. Anything that is poetic must have the proper rhyme. Some lines of certain hymns are close to rhyming, but they actually do not rhyme. <em>Flowed</em> does not rhyme with <em>blood</em> nor does <em>flock</em> rhyme with <em>dark.</em> To write a good hymn is not an easy task. A hymn must have the proper thought and proper poetic wording to take care of the rhyme and the rhythm.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TUNE OF THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>The tune of the hymns is also an important aspect of our knowing the hymns. Many good hymns can be killed by a poor melody. When we compiled our hymnal, we picked up this important point of having the proper and uplifted melody for the hymns. We listened to the melodies that we selected to see whether they fit the thought and the sensation of the hymns with which they were matched. All of the new hymns written by us for our hymnal were composed with an old melody. We did not compose any new melodies. &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo; was written to the tune of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s famous hymn&mdash;&ldquo;And can it be that I should gain.&rdquo; This melody for #499 stirs up people&rsquo;s desire and feeling. I treasure many of the melodies composed in the last century and at the beginning of this century. After the second world war, most of the melodies that came out could not match those earlier sacred melodies. For instance, the tunes for &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; (#1058) and &ldquo;Jesus, lover of my soul&rdquo; (#1057) are very solid. We should try to follow that kind of style in our composing of the hymns.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if we are going to have meetings according to the scriptural way, we must know the hymns. We have to know the crucial points of the contents of the hymns, the standard of the hymns, the sensation of the hymns, the wording of the hymns, and the tune of the hymns. We must remember that the hymns are not only for singing, but they also are even more for speaking in the meetings. Our speaking of the proper hymns to one another and our singing of them to the Lord will enrich, enliven, uplift, refresh, and strengthen the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: We have been trying to write children&rsquo;s songs using the Scriptures to help the children memorize the Word. It is almost impossible to rhyme these songs since their content is the Scriptures themselves. How do you feel about this point?</em></p>
<p>To write songs for the children is a difficult task, but in principle, I do not agree with writing songs for them with verses from the Scripture. If we want to help the children remember some verses from the Bible, we can simply instruct them to read and recite the verses. We should not try to make the verses singable for the children. I do not mean that we should not do this at all, but this is difficult to do. To write songs for the children requires a great amount of skill. Poetry must be composed for the young ones in a very skillful way. I saw a number of songs for the children that were all below standard according to my feeling. It is better not to have songs if the songs that we have are of such a low standard.</p>
<p><em>Question: When are we going to have a revision of our hymnal? I think that our present edition has served its purpose, showing how broad and all-inclusive we are. But after twenty-two years, the standard in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is much higher. I think we need a revision of the hymn book. The hymnal that we have entitled &ldquo;One Hundred Selected Hymns&rdquo; has been a great help to the saints. It gets them on the right track and has really uplifted the meetings. If possible, I think it would be good to have a new edition of the hymn book. How do you feel about this?</em></p>
<p>To recompile our hymnal is a hard task. In 1961 I wrote eighty-five hymns within about two months. Then in 1963 and 1964, I wrote over two hundred hymns. From that time until now, I have not had the time or the capacity to labor on the hymns. When we published our hymnal, we had the intention to show others that we knew the truth and that we were all-inclusive. In our hymnal about three hundred hymns have been written by us. The other approximately seven hundred and eighty were selected from more than eleven thousand hymns. We even selected some good hymns from the Pentecostal movement. Hymn #551 is a very good song from the Pentecostal movement. The chorus of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br />
I have passed the riven veil,<br />
Here the glories never fail,<br />
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br />
I am living in the presence of the King.</p>
<p>Brother Nee passed on the chorus of this hymn to us in a special conference in 1934. I translated the chorus of this hymn into Chinese, and it became very popular among us for many years. When we compiled our present hymnal, we included this hymn, and we improved some of the wording so that it would be more according to the truth. Hymn #310&mdash;&ldquo;Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom&rdquo;&mdash;is another Pentecostal hymn that we included in our hymnal on the assurance and joy of salvation. Our hymnal has collected the best hymns from many different sources.</p>
<p>I agree that the purpose of our present hymnal has probably been fulfilled and that it would be good if we had a revised one. But it is very difficult to decide what hymns to drop and what hymns to keep. I wrote hymn #18 on the faithfulness of our Father God to the tune of &ldquo;America the Beautiful.&rdquo; Even though we do not sing this hymn often, it is an excellent song on God&rsquo;s faithfulness, so it should not be dropped from a revised hymnal. It is hard to &ldquo;draw the line&rdquo; to decide which hymns to drop and which hymns to keep. Hymn #19&mdash;&ldquo;Great is Thy faithfulness!&rdquo;&mdash;is a very popular song, but I do not appreciate it so much in the aspect of the truth it contains. It is not that solid, complete, and perfect. Hymn #18, however, is full of truth. Every verse was written with the truth revealed in the Scriptures as a basis. This hymn begins with the universe and ends with the New Jerusalem. The rainbow around the throne and the foundation of the New Jerusalem both signify God&rsquo;s faithfulness. The colors of the twelve layers of the foundation give the appearance of a rainbow, signifying that the holy city is built upon and secured by God&rsquo;s faithfulness in keeping His covenant (Gen. 9:8-17).</p>
<p>If we did drop some hymns from our present hymnal, I believe that about four hundred hymns could be dropped. Although we might not use many of the remaining hymns in our meetings, we would have to keep them for the sake of the truth. We also need more hymns. In the past twenty-two years, we have received many higher visions from the Lord, but there are no hymns to match or express them.</p>
<p><em>Question: Can you fellowship with us concerning the use of the hymns in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting? We have a tendency to flip from one hymn to another in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, and we sing many hymns. We can hardly considerthe content of one hymn before we move to another hymn. Furthermore, our scope of knowing the hymns is very limited. We may only touch fifty or sixty hymns at the most. When I was in the Far East, I enjoyed that the saints were not in any hurry to get through the hymns in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. Two or three hymns were enough to dwell on for an entire meeting. Another thing that is troubling to me about the calling of hymns in the Lord&rsquo;s table is the lack of sensitivity to the flow of the meeting. Someone will call a hymn that is not according to or completely contrary to the flow. If I say that we need to change the hymn, I feel bad, but if I do not change it, the meeting suffers and many times it is impossible to bring the meeting back to the flow of the Spirit. Can you fellowship with us about the use of the hymns in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting since it seems like that is where we use most of the hymns?</em></p>
<p>We must be raised up by the Lord to know the hymns. I would advise all of us to read the hymnal and become acquainted with all of the hymns. Thirty or forty years ago, we were very strict in the Lord&rsquo;s table. We did not allow the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s table to choose hymns that were far away from the purpose of the table. In the Lord&rsquo;s table, we remember the Lord Himself by displaying His death. We do not remember His death but we remember His very person by exhibiting, or displaying, His death. In this sense, all the hymns that are chosen and used in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting should be in two categories: 1) The hymns in the Lord&rsquo;s table should be concerning the Lord&rsquo;s person and should always help people to appreciate Him. 2) We also need some hymns to show forth His death. If we can learn the hymns in our hymnal, we will be much better off in selecting the hymns.</p>
<p>To sing hymn after hymn in our Lord&rsquo;s table meeting is not good. In one Lord&rsquo;s table meeting it is possible to use just one hymn. In order to do this, we need to speak the hymns. Thirty or forty years ago, we were too legal. We instructed the saints strictly that they should only choose hymns in the proper category for the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. There are basically two sections to the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. The first section is for remembering the Lord and the second section is for worshipping the Father. We need some discernment to choose the right hymns in the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>I hope that we will spend some time to study the hymns. Our knowledge of the hymns will help us and will be a great help to all the meetings. It is really hard for us to adjust or correct the saints when they call an inappropriate hymn in the meeting. We may do this sometimes, but generally it is not so profitable. I hope that some leading ones in all the churches would say something concerning the hymns once a week for ten or fifteen minutes. Then the saints will gain some help for the long run and the meetings will be spontaneously adjusted and enriched.</p>
<p><em>Question: How did you write the hymns?</em></p>
<p>The secret of learning anything is to do it again and again. In learning to do something, we make mistakes, and we are perfected by learning from those mistakes. I wrote hymn #501&mdash;&ldquo;O glorious Christ, Savior mine&rdquo;&mdash;and then I polished, corrected, and adjusted it close to one hundred times. Now it is very hard to improve this hymn because it has been polished and adjusted to the uttermost. Some of the hymns that others among us wrote in the past were written in a quick and light way. This is not proper. The spiritual songs and hymns are the cream of a person&rsquo;s writing, thought, learning, life experience, and spiritual experience. If I did not have the experience of living Christ, I could not have composed that hymn&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo; That hymn is the cream of my experience, my thought, my learning, and my writing.</p>
<p>I would especially encourage the brothers who are forty-five or under to look to the Lord in this matter of composing the hymns. We need good composers and writers among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. A person who is forty-five can write for twenty-five years until he is seventy. We need such people. When a hymn is written, it has to be polished, adjusted, and improved again and again. The best writers and composers use lexicons to help them. To write a hymn is a difficult task, but we need some doers in this matter.</p>
<p>To sing the psalms of the Old Testament is somewhat according to the Old Testament economy. We need some melodies on the book of Ephesians. We need songs on the truth from Ephesians 1:3-14 and from 3:3-11. These portions of the Word need some melodies which help the saints get into the feeling of the New Testament economy. To sing the verses from the Scriptures, we do not need to be bound. We can rewrite the verses to fit the meter and have the appropriate rhyme while maintaining the revelation and the truth that is there. We can use proper phrases from the Scriptures like &ldquo;unto sonship&rdquo; (Eph. 1:5) in our hymns. We need a few Charles Wesleys among us. His writings and his melodies were really marvelous. One of his great melodies is the one for &ldquo;And can it be that I should gain&rdquo; (#296). That melody is marvelous. A. B. Simpson is another great writer and composer of hymns that we should take as a pattern.</p>
<p>I want to mention again that we need to learn to speak the hymns in our meetings. This practice with Christ as the center is refreshing, nourishing, edifying, and building up. If all the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery practiced speaking the hymns in the meetings, the meetings would be living, refreshing, and rich. This would give all the saints a way to share their enjoyment with others. We should pick up the burden to speak the hymns and endeavor to do it in our locality.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
