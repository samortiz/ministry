<p>What does it mean to be born of the Holy Spirit? When a person believes in the Lord and confesses his sins, the Holy Spirit enters into him to enliven his human spirit. His spirit is immediately enlivened. First there is death, and then there is life. We pass from death into life. This is the way that we obtain a second life. This is the way God&rsquo;s life enters into us.</p>
<p>The life that we receive is resurrection life, which is able to raise us from death. When we are baptized, we do not remain in water to be buried there and never rise again. We must realize that there is not only the ministry of John the Baptist but also the ministry of the Lord Jesus. John&rsquo;s ministry is a ministry of condemnation and death, but the ministry of the Lord Jesus is an enlivening ministry. It is a ministry unto life. The Lord causes people to have life. When the life of God enters into people, they are made alive. When a person is baptized, on the one hand, he is baptized in water, which is a burial; on the other hand, he is raised up out of the water, which is resurrection. The old creation is buried, and the new creation is resurrected. What is in Adam is buried, and what is in Christ is resurrected. Through this process of death and resurrection we are born again, and we obtain a second life&mdash;the life of God.</p>
<p>Without going through this process of death and resurrection, we can have only the human life, not God&rsquo;s life. It is through believing and repenting that we receive this spiritual fact, and it is through our going into death that we can come out of death and have God&rsquo;s life in us, thereby having a second birth and a second life. This is to be born of water and the Spirit. This is regeneration. This is death and resurrection. Water is for death, and the Spirit is for resurrection. Being born of water means that we enter into water and are baptized in water. Being born of the Spirit means that we are resurrected in the Holy Spirit. This is death and resurrection. We receive life through death, and this is also to be born of water and the Spirit. This is regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENTERING INTO GOD&rsquo;S KINGDOM<br />
THROUGH REGENERATION</h2>
<p>Once we are regenerated, we have two lives: God&rsquo;s life is added to our human life. We are in God&rsquo;s kingdom, and we know the things of God&rsquo;s kingdom. The word <em>kingdom</em> does not refer merely to a sphere of authority, but even more, it refers to a realm. For instance, there is an animal world and a plant world. Animals know the things in the animal world and do not know the things in the plant world. Likewise, plants know the things in the plant world and do not know the things in the animal world. Birds occupy one section of the animal world, and they know the things in that section. Birds do not know the things in the dog section, the cat section, or the cattle section. Similarly, mankind also has its own world. The human world is the human kingdom. Man has the human life and therefore knows the things in the human kingdom. Likewise, God is also a &ldquo;world.&rdquo; If man wants to understand the things in God&rsquo;s realm and be able to submit to the authority in God&rsquo;s kingdom, man must have God&rsquo;s life. When we have God&rsquo;s life, we are in God&rsquo;s world. Spontaneously, we know the things in God&rsquo;s world, and we can see the things in God&rsquo;s world. This is the result of regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OBTAINING A SPIRITUAL LIFE<br />
THROUGH REGENERATION</h2>
<p>Through regeneration we have God&rsquo;s life, are in God&rsquo;s world, know the things in God&rsquo;s world, and can submit to the authority of God&rsquo;s kingdom. The life that we obtain through regeneration is not a life of the flesh; it is a spiritual life. Hence, in John 3:6 the Lord said, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Nicodemus thought that to be born again was to be born from his mother&rsquo;s womb a second time, but the Lord Jesus said that not only was Nicodemus unable to be born again from his mother&rsquo;s womb, but that even if he were able to enter into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born again, he would still be born of the flesh and would still be flesh. Since he was born of the flesh, he had only the natural life; that is, he had man&rsquo;s original life, which is now a corrupt life. No matter how many times one could be born of the flesh, his life would still be a corrupt life. This is not regeneration. To be regenerated is to be born not of the flesh but of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO CONTACT GOD WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Man has a body and a spirit deep within him, and between the body and the spirit is the soul. We often confuse the spirit with the soul, but our spirit is different from our soul. Regeneration means that we are born of the Spirit; we are born not in the flesh nor in the soul but in the spirit, which is the deepest part of our being. God is Spirit, and the words that He speaks to us are also spirit (6:63). Since God is Spirit, those who worship Him must worship in spirit (4:24). If we want to contact God, we must be in our spirit. We cannot touch God with our hands nor see God with our eyes nor smell God with our nose. We cannot use any of the sense organs in our physical body to contact God.</p>
<p>Which organ do you use to differentiate the color white from green? If you close your eyes and use your ears, which are for hearing, you will not be able to tell whether a color is white or green. If you close your eyes, you cannot use your ears to hear a color or differentiate any colors. Nevertheless, you cannot say that there are no colors. It is not that there are no colors, but that you are using the wrong organ and hence cannot discern colors. You know when someone is speaking, because you have ears, and you use your ears to hear. You use your eyes to see, but are you able to see sounds? Although there are sounds, they cannot be seen with your eyes; they can be heard only with your ears. If you use the wrong organ, your ability to touch or sense will be annulled.</p>
<p>God is Spirit, and we must worship Him in spirit. We cannot worship God with our ears, eyes, nose, or hands. We must worship Him with our spirit. When we pray, we usually go to a quiet place and close our eyes, because our whole being needs to be calm. All our physical organs need to be brought to a stop so that we can use our inner organ, our spirit, to contact God. We do not contact God and worship Him according to our thoughts, views, feelings, or preferences. On the contrary, we need to stop all these faculties, calm ourselves down, and turn to our spirit. Only then can we contact God. God is Spirit; therefore, we must contact Him with our spirit.</p>
<p>We cannot see God with our eyes, and we are unable to hear Him with our ears. However, if we calm down and use our spirit, if we turn to our spirit to draw near to God and contact Him, immediately we will sense something in our spirit. We will sense that our spirit is bright. There will also be some activity in our spirit that causes us to sense that this or that matter is wrong, or that we should love and cherish others. The fact that there is such activity in us means that God is touching us in our spirit. When God&rsquo;s Spirit touches our spirit, we become enlivened within.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT MOTIVATING<br />
AND OPERATING IN MAN LIKE THE WIND</h2>
<p>The regenerated life inside of us is the Spirit. This Spirit is invisible and intangible. The Lord Jesus said that the Spirit is like the wind. &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes&rdquo; (3:8). The Spirit is like the wind and can be very strong.</p>
<p>Every year in Hong Kong, around August or September, there is a strong wind. Sometimes a ship is even blown onto the shore. But have you seen the wind? You may say that you have not seen the wind, but it seems that you have seen it. The wind comes with power and with a manifestation that causes us to recognize that there is wind. Sometimes when we are walking on the street, the wind blows so strongly that it becomes difficult for us to walk. Sometimes the wind blows faster than a car can move. The wind blows where it wills; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit. Although we cannot see or touch the Spirit, He is blowing in us, and sometimes He causes us to be beside ourselves. For this reason, people often say that those who believe in Jesus are not normal. This is true. How can a ship that is blown onto the shore be normal? How can a person who is being pushed by the wind be normal? God operating in us is like the wind blowing on us.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the place where the disciples gathered was filled with the wind. A violent wind came and blew upon Peter and John, making them look like they were drunk with wine; they were crazy and fearless (Acts 2:1-13). This is the result of being born of the Spirit. This is a spiritual birth. This is man obtaining the eternal life of God within him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ Making His Home in Our Heart and the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
