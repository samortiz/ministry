<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF THE CHURCH TODAY</h2><p>Consecration is not only a personal matter. It is the way of the church today. We are clear about a person's individual position and his way, but how should the church go on? In the first century the apostles as a body forsook everything to serve the Lord. In the four Gospels the apostles dropped everything to follow the Lord individually. Then at the beginning of Acts three thousand and then five thousand people were saved. The church life began, and the believers followed the example of the apostles to forsake everything to follow the Lord. The whole church forsook everything (2:44-45; 4:32-35). Later the church became degraded. The clergy-laity system was formed, and the clergy monopolized all spiritual things. The laity, composed of secular men and women, became lax. However, the church did not lower its expectation concerning the apostles. It expected the clergy to suffer, to forsake all, and to deny the world. We all know that Catholicism forbids its priests from marrying. The less human they are, the more they are qualified to bear spiritual things. This is a wrong concept. Paul's word on presenting the body as a living sacrifice is for the whole Body (Rom. 12:1); it was not addressed to the apostles alone. Today everyone expects a preacher to be poor, and everyone expects the co-workers to suffer, but no one expects the ordinary believer to be the same. This, however, is not the truth of the Bible. It is a fallen concept of the church. When the church moves on and advances, it will find that forsaking everything is not the exclusive business of the apostles but a practice that belongs to all the believers. In the past many people have had the concept that the workers should be particularly poor and suffering, that they must forsake everything before they can be considered a servant of the Lord. Today we are welcoming everyone to join the co-workers' lot. In other words, we should take the way of life and the way of service of a worker; we should live and serve accordingly. This is the way the church has decided to take today.</p><p>All of us should rise up and be workers. This means that all of us have to be servants of God. Our worldly occupation is only for maintaining our livelihood. We may have different occupations, but we are all servants of the Lord. Everything is offered up to the Lord and to the church. The church may assign you to be a businessman. A person cannot live two or three times above the standard of a co-worker just because he is a businessman. This is absolutely wrong. Just as we expect a co-worker to be frugal, we have to be frugal. We have to make a resolution never to buy anything carelessly. We have to save all we can and limit our spending. This applies to every brother who has handed himself over. In the past there might have been a difference between the co-workers and those who were not co-workers. We can no longer have this distinction.</p><p>A minister of the word cannot keep back any word for himself. Similarly, a moneymaker cannot keep back any money for himself. Holding back the Lord's word and having reservations is a cheating in the Lord's ministry of the word. Paul, David, John, Daniel, Ezekiel, and others never hid the word in their ministry of God's word (cf. Acts 20:27; Col. 1:25). A minister of God's word has to share His word with the church. Similarly, those involved with the ministry of mammon should share their mammon with the church; they should not keep it for their own use. From now on we should save as much as possible and sell whatever we can sell, but we should not force unbelieving parents, wives, or husbands to go along. We can only practice this ourselves. Under all possible circumstances, we should save as much as we can save and sell as much as we can sell. I do not advise that we eat poorly on purpose; this will ruin our health. That is not wise. We should sell what we can sell but not deprive the body of its necessary nutrition. We must take good care of our body. If we have the potential to use our body for another thirty years, we should use it for this time. It should not waste away in two or three years. Other than this consideration, we should save as much as we can save and give away as much as we can. Give up everything for the saints' and for the gospel's sake.</p>
