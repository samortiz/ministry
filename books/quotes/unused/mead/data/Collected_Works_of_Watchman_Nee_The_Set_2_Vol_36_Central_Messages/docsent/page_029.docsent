   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IS THE LIGHT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord not only said that He is the bread of life, but He also said that He is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Food is for satisfaction, while light is for seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When one is satisfied, he has the strength, and when one sees, he can walk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen how Christ is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now let us consider how Christ is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we have to point out that the light of life is not the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone knows that as Christians, we should read the Bible properly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if we read the Bible as a book of knowledge, a textbook of theology, we will merely gain knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we read the Bible this way, we may gain some doctrines from the Bible which are truly scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet these are mere letters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time the Lord was born in Bethlehem, many priests and scribes could memorize the books of the prophets, but they did not know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today even though we have one book more than they, the New Testament, it is still possible for men to know only the letters of the Bible without knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not saying that we should not read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we need to realize that when we read the Bible, it is possible that we will gain only knowledge instead of knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of the priests and scribes had only dead knowledge; they did not know the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people think that the light of life is just knowledge, doctrines, theology, or church dogmas.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some persons say that they have received some light, but the light they are speaking of is not necessarily the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The light they are speaking of may only be interpretations of certain verses or certain teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At most they afford others a little more Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The light of life is not knowledge or anything other than the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said He Himself is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The light of life is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, many people can tell us from their experience that what they see in the light of life is often difficult to articulate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Interestingly, those who see it see it, yet they cannot say what they have actually seen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once someone talked to a sister to find out if she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He asked her a few questions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She answered, "When I was first saved, I did not know what it was, but I knew I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you believe that I am saved, I am saved, and if you do not believe that I am saved, I am still saved."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What she said is true.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She was indeed saved, but she could not explain how she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She knew it, but she could not explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when the light comes, we may not be able to tell others many doctrines; it may be two or three years later before we can utter some doctrines or teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This light is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we see the Lord, we see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What difference then does it make to us whether or not we see the light?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What change will there be if we see the light?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The difference is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we truly see the light, we will fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The light not only enlightens us but also kills us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before Paul received the shining, it was not easy to put him on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But once he received the shining, he fell.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people always want to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They try hard to be humble; they act humble in the way they speak and the way they act.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But this kind of humility is very exhausting; even others feel exhausted for them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is like a small child lifting a big dictionary; the book may not be very heavy, but it is exhausting for him to carry it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not easy for a proud man to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not easy for us to fall down from the throne of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But once the light of the Lord shines on us, we fall immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot explain it, but as soon as the light shines, we fall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Teachings cannot make a man fall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A person can hear eight or ten teachings, and may even be able to recite them clearly and reasonably, but he remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A message which should bring one to tears, or which should touch one's carnal living and bring a man to his knees, can be turned into a subject of study, and a person may think that he has received something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a doctrine becomes a thing, a teaching becomes a thing, and words become a thing, the result is death; it is not light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One brother was so happy after he heard the teachings of Romans 6 that he thought he had seen Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But after a few days, he and his wife fell into a big argument.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Romans 6 that he saw was a thing; it was letters from a book; it was not the light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If what he saw was light, he would not have been the same.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He would fall down in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Light is piercing; it can do what a man cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A teaching will not do it, the brothers and sisters will not be able to help, and our own effort will not achieve it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the minute the light shines, everything is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may say that we are very stubborn, but once the light shines, we will become soft.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When John saw the light, he became as dead Rev 1:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When Daniel saw the light, he fell toward the ground as dead Dan 10:5-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No one can see the Lord's face without falling down, and no one can see the Lord without becoming as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is difficult to make ourselves die or to humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But once the light shines, everything follows.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord's light kills.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once a man receives the Lord's light, he falls.</S>
