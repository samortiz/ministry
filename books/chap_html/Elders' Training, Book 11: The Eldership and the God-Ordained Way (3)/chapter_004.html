To contact people in a proper way is not easy. It is important for us to know the purpose of our contact with others. Many Christians contact people for the Lord, but they do not know what the purpose of their contact with others should be. Some today preach the gospel for the purpose of carrying out a social work. However, if we gain people in order to carry out a social work, we will miss the Lord's purpose in gaining them. The proper purpose in gaining people is firstly that they may be regenerated for the increase of the kingdom of God (Matt. 28:19). Then it is the feeding and the raising up of the new members of the Body of Christ (John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7). Thirdly, it is the perfecting of the saints (Eph. 4:12). We gain people to perfect them to grow in life and develop their spiritual talents, their spiritual gifts, that they may be functioning members in the Body of Christ. Finally, our purpose in contacting others is to help them to learn how to speak for the Lord, to prophesy, for the building up of the organic Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:3-5, 31). This is a heavenly, divine, and spiritual purpose, a purpose that is related to God's economy and the spiritual warfare against the power of darkness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED<br>OF TRANSFORMATION<br>FOR OUR CONTACT WITH PEOPLE</H2><P>If we see what the purpose of contacting people is, we will realize that we are short in our contact with others. This is because we were not raised and educated to contact people in this way. To contact people in this way is not in our thought, habit, or consideration. Therefore, we must be transformed. In Romans 12, when Paul desired to help the saints in the church to be built up to be living and functioning members, he first said, "And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind" (v. 2). Regardless of what we are, if we touch the building up of the Body of Christ, our entire being must be transformed. To be transformed does not mean merely to have a change. To be transformed is to be reconstituted. Our being is our human constitution, which comes from our birth, our education, our practices, and our habit. We need to be transformed, that is, to be reconstituted.</P><P>An elder may be a very good gentleman according to his natural being. However, what we are in a natural way means nothing. It is not useful, and we must not use it to build up the church. In regard to the building up of the Body of Christ, we should have no trust in what we are naturally. Rather, we must be transformed, reconstituted. We need to be remade, created anew. Even this elders' training should not be merely a training; it should be a reconstituting.</P><P>We should not contact people according to our old way. Even our experience in the church is not trustworthy, because in our experience many habitual things have been constituted into our being. The absolute requirement for an elder is that he must be another person. As long as one is an elder and desires to be a good elder, he must be reconstituted. He must present himself to the Lord for the Lord's reconstituting work. We all need to be reminded of this. All the points in this and the previous message should remind us of how we must be reconstituted to contact people in a proper way.</P>
