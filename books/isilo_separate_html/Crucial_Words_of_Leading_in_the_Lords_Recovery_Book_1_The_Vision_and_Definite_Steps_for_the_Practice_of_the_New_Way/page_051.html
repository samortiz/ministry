<p>Do not think that the big meetings are better than the small meetings. Do not say, &ldquo;We have been elders for so long, and the situation has been so prosperous all this time. Now that we are broken up into small meetings, nothing seems to be working properly anymore.&rdquo; Some overseas brothers have taken the time to come purposely to visit and observe us. They may say, &ldquo;You tell us to come and see. What is there to see? Are there merely these home meetings? Some home meetings are conducted in the coffee shops at 9:30 P.M. after the waiters finish their day and the shop is closed. What kind of meeting is this?&rdquo; Outwardly speaking, there is nothing to see, but there is a different perspective. This coffee house was once void of believers. Now everyone is a believer and is bringing others to the Lord. We need to bow down and worship the Lord for this. How wonderful it is that when the coffee shop closes, everyone gathers around the tables to study the Word, fellowship, and lead other workers to Christ! In such a meeting, there is no boss, no cook, no waiter, and no cashier. Everyone is a member of God&rsquo;s family. If we consider it from this angle, we will say, &ldquo;What a glory this is to the Lord!&rdquo; This is the kind of gospel work to which we should give ourselves.</p>
<p>Consider the four Gospels in the New Testament. When the Lord was on the earth, did He always do things in a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; way? Is it not true that often the Lord performed His work in a seemingly messy way? Outwardly speaking, there was no glamour in anything He did. If we were with the Lord, we might have said, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, we heard of Your name, and we were told that You have a very successful work. This is the reason we came purposely to see You.&rdquo; To be sure, the Lord would answer us by saying, &ldquo;What do you want to see? Do you want to see how the Pharisees oppose Me? Do you want to see how the Sadducees tempt Me? Do you want to see how Peter denies Me? Do you want to see how the disciples desert Me? What are you here to see?&rdquo; If what could be seen was all there was, it would have been a very poor situation indeed. But the truth lies deeper than the surface. The Lord accomplished God&rsquo;s will; He finished all of God&rsquo;s work. In the end, in spite of the persecutions, oppositions, and denials, He gained one hundred twenty people who prayed in one accord for ten days in a little room in Jerusalem and brought in God&rsquo;s kingdom. This is the view we should have. I have felt during the past few years that we owe the Lord much, and we are also much indebted to the people of this land. The Lord sent us here. We have been here for more than thirty years, but even now we have not fully presented the gospel to them. This is certainly to our shame.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVOTING OUR FULL TIME<br />
TO THE WORK OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>I am an &ldquo;old hand&rdquo; in the matter of serving the Lord full time. I know what the young full-timers are thinking. You waver whenever you think about your future. When you were in college, you may have been called to serve the Lord full time, but at that time you may have thought that the time had not yet come. You told yourself that you should wait until you graduate from school. However, after you graduated, you still waited, and the waiting took many years. One day the Lord raised up the environment to blow away all your concerns. You could not wait any longer; in a sense, you were forced to drop everything. I have already told you that when I began to serve full time, I was prepared to go anywhere for the gospel. If I thirsted, I was ready to drink the water from the mountain. If I hungered, I was ready to eat the roots of the trees. However, when I actually quit my job to serve full time, I did not need to live that kind of life at all. We do not need to worry that much. The Lord is everything to us.</p>
<p>Today on this earth, no profession will abandon a person to starve to death. The only way that a person will starve is if he does not work at all. As long as we are willing to do something, we will surely not starve to death. The full-timers should not be afraid that there will be the need to starve. Our profession is the highest profession. Our Lord is the One who holds the keys of death and of Hades (Rev. 1:18). Death will not find us. We should not think that serving the Lord is a way of poverty. I can say strongly that while any profession can lead to poverty, serving the Lord will never lead to poverty. Serving the Lord is a golden profession. If we have the burden to serve the Lord, no one can frustrate us. It is something that is full of glory. Who among the full-time workers here has suffered hunger? Who is suffering from poverty? And who does not have the sense of glory in him? Therefore, we must not worry about our living.</p>
<p>Of course, since the Lord cares for our needs, we must be faithful to Him. We cannot become careless merely because we have a golden profession. We need to labor diligently. We should not waste our time with mere mental knowledge. Rather, we should give ourselves to the Lord in a selfless way. This is the reason that I exhort us all to have small groups and to subdivide the small groups into the homes. In this way everyone will have something to do, and everyone can function. At present, the church in Taipei has a thousand homes. We all need to rise up to labor together. If every one of us would work on one home a week, in a month we will have worked on all one thousand homes. If we do this, all the home meetings will surely be made alive by our work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DROPPING OUR OLD CONCEPTS AND CARING ONLY FOR FRUIT AND NOT FOR APPEARANCES</h2>
<p>I hope that we can all drop our old concepts. Do not care for uniformity. Do not care for appearances. Rather, care for the fruit. What we want is an orchard, not a garden. A garden is for show, but an orchard is for fruit. Once our concepts are changed, we will act differently when we go to a home meeting. When a meeting is dying, we will not give it up. Rather, we will immediately administer some &ldquo;booster shots&rdquo;; we will do some &ldquo;CPR&rdquo; by stirring up, encouraging, and consoling the saints. We will do this until the meeting is revived again. We must not be discouraged by anything, and the host of the home where the meeting is held must not be discouraged by anything. We should pray together, read the Word together, and visit and shepherd together. At least, we need to shepherd and encourage each other. We must learn to do this.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> </body></html>
