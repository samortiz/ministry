   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our speaking to the saints, we need to develop the Lord's words in John 14:17-20, which reveal the Spirit as the reality of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. Dwelling in Us</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 8:11 must be fully emphasized and developed to show the saints that in this one verse you can see that the Father is working, the Son is dispensing, and the Spirit is giving life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This verse shows us the functioning of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to dispense life into our being, even into the circumference of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The body is the circumference of our being, and the spirit is the center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The indwelling Triune God dispenses life to our whole being, and this dispensing reaches even to our circumference, our body.</S>
