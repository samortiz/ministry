[1]  THE WORD OF THE CROSS DYING WITH THE LORD TO SIN
[2]  The following chapter is composed of two articles by Watchman Nee first published in the Spiritual Light Journal in Nanking in 1925.
[3]  When the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross, not only did He die for the sinners, opening a living way for sinners to obtain eternal life and to come to God, He also died with the sinners on the cross.
[4]  When the Lord Jesus died with the sinners on the cross, He delivered man from the power of sin the old man is dead, and he is no longer a slave of sin.
[5]  We do not die by ourselves; rather, we die together with the Lord.
[6]  We were baptized "into His death" Rom 6:3 ; "we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death" Rom 6:5 ; "we have died with Christ" Rom 6:8 ; "our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves" Rom 6:6 .
[7]  The old man loved sin exceedingly; it wanted to sin, craved for sin, and was fond of doing sinful things; the body followed after the old man to sin and became the body of sin.
[8]  To reckon yourself dead to sin is to reckon yourself already crucified.
[9]  It is to reckon that your old man has already been crucified, and that the cross of the Lord Jesus is the cross for your old man; it is to reckon that the death of the Lord Jesus is the death of your old man, and to reckon that the time the Lord Jesus died nineteen hundred years ago is the time your old man died.
[10]  This being the case, how much we need to be watchful and on the alert so that the old man will never have a day to rise up again!
[11]  In our experience, death to self is deeper and more advanced than death to sin.
[12]  Therefore, after they have received the light, and have realized how to die with the Lord, and how to reckon themselves dead to sin, they rely on the power of the Holy Spirit and begin to seriously reckon themselves dead, and to allow the victory of the cross to be expressed in their heart and through them.
[13]  But sin, being so powerful, affects the self, dominates the self, suppresses the self, and forces the self to come up with more ideas to sin.
[14]  The self is our personality and everything contained in our personality.
[15]  Out of the self grow our personal opinion, taste, thought, longing, bias, love, and hatred.
[16]  What Galatians 2:20 speaks of is something accomplished once for all.
[17]  After we realize that our self needs to be put to death, we should then by faith acknowledge in a definite way that "I have been crucified with Christ."
[18]  The self includes the will, the emotions, and the intelligence, etc. This does not mean that when we believe in our self being crucified with Christ, our will, emotions, intellect, etc., will be annulled! No one can annihilate the few faculties which make up his being just by believing in his having been crucified with the Lord! To die with the Lord simply means to no longer allow the self to be the master, to no longer act according to one's own will, emotions, and thoughts, and to no longer allow the self life to have its way; it means to allow the Lord's Spirit to rule over everything that the self encompasses, so that a person will obey God's life within.
[19]  What has been said above was achieved once for all.
[20]  But is it enough for us only to believe once that we have been crucified with Christ?
[21]  We can look into another portion of the Word which tells us how the goodness of the self life should be put to death before one can bring forth good fruit.
[22]  This passage, however, deals more with the self life than with the self itself.
[23]  After He spoke these words, He did not leave us in darkness, but He continued by explaining: "He who loves his life in the original, his soul life loses it i.e., in eternity bears no fruit , and he who hates his life in the original, his soul life in this world shall keep it i.e., not being barren unto eternal life in the original, the spiritual life ."
[24]  It is not enough to be a grain of wheat alone.
