	 <h2 class="head1">THE GROUND BEING BLESSED BY GOD<br />
AND THE BUILDING RETAINING THE BLESSING</h2>
<p>I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for at least twenty-five years, and I have suffered much during this time. Therefore, as soon as a situation arises, I know whether it will be a gain or a loss. For example, because I knew that we would suffer a great loss when Brother T. Austin-Sparks was here last spring, I tried to prevent anything from happening. I acknowledge that Brother Sparks is spiritual. It is difficult to find another person on the earth today who is as spiritual as he is. Hence, for the past thirty years Brother Nee, some saints, and I have appreciated him. We also spent the past thirty years observing him, and we wonder whether his understanding of the Body of Christ is appropriate.</p>
<p>The treasure and the earthen vessel (2 Cor. 4:7) must match. The container is important. Hence, we spent quite some time last year to stress the ground of the church. This is also the reason that we are fellowshipping concerning the building up of the church. If the ground and the building up of the church are not proper, there will be no result to our work, and the Lord&rsquo;s blessing will not remain. We cannot let this happen. Therefore, the blessing and the container must match.</p>
<p>If our intention is to form a separate group in Christianity and thereby become a sect, we deserve to be cursed; the Lord will never bless us. We also deserve to be cursed if we always dispute with other believers and try to be different. However, because the church is in a state of confusion, we must find the way to obtain God&rsquo;s blessing and find the proper ground that will retain God&rsquo;s blessing. Moreover, we have to find a way for the believers who stand on this ground to be built up so that God&rsquo;s blessing will not leak out.</p>
<p>We cannot change the condition of Christianity. God allows this state of confusion to exist, and we cannot change it. Any intention to change this is foolishness. However, since we desire to follow the Lord, live in His presence, and be useful to Him, we must find a way to retain what we know and have experienced. We need the ground and the building up to keep the blessing that we have gained. Otherwise, the fruit of all our labor will disappear.</p>
<p>We must not labor in a foolish way. Our work can be compared to drawing water out of a well with a bucket. If we pour the water on the ground, it will disappear. Therefore, we need to consider how to bring in the blessing, the proper ground that contains the blessing, and the building that preserves the blessing.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s blessing, which is among us, has much to do with our way and the ground on which we stand. It is also related to our service in coordination. Without our way, our ground, and our service in coordination, we would not have God&rsquo;s blessing. However, if the building up and coordination among us were stronger, there would be at least five thousand saints in the meetings.</p>
<p>Even though we do not emphasize the result of our work, it would be better to have five thousand saints who can hear the messages that are being released instead of two thousand saints. It would even be better for ten thousand saints to hear these messages. We do not desire a large crowd, but we nonetheless want the word of God to reach many people. Therefore, it is important that we know how to keep the believers after they are saved. We have baptized between seven and eight thousand people, but only one-fourth of this number were in the conference. This shows that the coordination and building up among us are weak. If our coordination were strong, about five thousand saints would attend the conferences.</p>
<p>In comparison with other Christian groups, we have received more of God&rsquo;s blessing. But our numbers are an indication of our weakness and inadequateness. The blessing that we receive is because of our coordination. Even though our coordination is inadequate, we still have a measure of coordination. Other believers do not have God&rsquo;s blessing because they do not have this coordination. We are blessed by God because we have some coordination and building, even if they are weak. We thank the Lord for this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br />
TO DO THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>The work has many aspects. There is nothing that has only one aspect. For example, there are many aspects to be considered in order to build a house. A house cannot consist of only walls with no windows; neither can a house have windows and doors in every wall. It is not a simple matter to plan where the doors and windows should be. This also applies to spiritual work. We should not think that it is good enough to lead the saints to be spiritual. We need to be spiritual, but we also need coordination. Our most obvious need is the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ. This is the most important aspect of the work.</p>
<p>If I always did everything by myself and did not perfect the saints, what would be the result? There would be only thirty to fifty saints who would be helped to be spiritual, and they would eventually become spiritual antiques. They would be beautiful and spiritual Christians who are useful only for exhibition. If there were a Christian exhibition, my work might be the best display. However, my work would have no usefulness in the building. This is the reason that I did not labor in this way.</p>
<p>When we began the work, we took the way of perfecting the saints. If there were an exhibition, none of the saints would be good enough to display, because our work is not for exhibition. We had only poor quality materials that we patched together. However, we thank the Lord that even though the materials were poor and unsightly, thousands of believers, when patched together, learned to serve the Lord and bring in the blessing. This is the right principle for our work.</p>
<p>We must see this principle and hold it. This does not mean that we do not need to be spiritual but that in whatever we do, we must learn to perfect others. We must perfect the saints whenever we do something. Our gifts and capacity vary, but we must still grasp this principle so that the brothers and sisters under our leading will learn to do whatever we can do. Let me repeat, we may differ in our gifts and capacity, but it is not right for the brothers and sisters under our leading not to understand what we do. The principle of our work must be to bring the saints who are under our leading to do whatever we can do, even if they do not have our capacity or know as much as we do.</p>
<p>Just like the apostle Paul in Acts 20:27, in our labor we should not shrink from declaring all the counsel of God to the saints. We should declare all that we know to the saints and teach them everything that we can do. We should not have any reservation. We want the saints to know what we know and to be better at doing what we do. This is what it means to perfect others. We must hold on to this principle when we labor. The result will be the building up of the church.</p>
<p>When the church in a locality is built up, we can leave. While we are with the church, it has one extra pair of hands to help. When we leave, the church lacks only one pair of hands. This is not a serious lack. Whether we are present or absent, the church service continues. The service in the church must not stop when we leave. This is not like the situation in some groups in Christianity where the Sunday worship stops when the pastor leaves. Our labor must not have this result. A strong church and a strong service must remain when we leave a locality. This is the right kind of work according to the proper principle.</p>
<p>This type of work will force us to learn many things and to change our old ways. We should never be content with merely leading people to salvation and helping them to love the Lord. While we lead people to salvation and to love the Lord, we must grasp every opportunity to teach them everything that we can do in order to perfect them and make them useful vessels. We should work with the saints individually and make them useful vessels so that they may function according to their measure. This is to build them up. Furthermore, they will be able to coordinate with other saints in the service. If we labor in this way, we are a proper worker who is doing a good work. Then the Lord can gain a corporate vessel in the locality where we labor. This corporate vessel has a capacity that is larger and more useful than ours. The spiritual issue and blessing of such labor are unlimited. We are one person, but the issue is a church that comes out of our labor and continual perfecting of the saints. We must see this principle and learn to work according to this way.</p>
