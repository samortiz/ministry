Suppose a father wants his son to do something for him. The father gives the order, but the son says, "I have something in my hands. When I am finished with what is in my hands, I will do what you want me to do." This is the meaning of having something in one's hands. Before the father asks the son to do something, the son already has something in his hands. Every one of us has something in our hands. In our course of following the Lord, we often are hindered by things in our hands. We have to tend to the things in our hands first. As a result, God's assignment is delayed. It is hard to find a person who does not have anything in his hands. We always have things in our hands prior to God's speaking, and we always have many things in our hands before the outer man is broken. The outer man is involved in business, things, labor, and activities. When God's Spirit operates in our spirit, it becomes impossible for our outer man to meet the demands. The things in our hands disqualify us from being useful spiritually in any real way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OUTER MAN BEING LIMITED IN STRENGTH</H2><P>Our outer man's strength is limited. Suppose a brother is not very strong and can only lift fifty catties of weight [Translator's note: a Chinese measure of weight]. If he has fifty catties on his shoulder, he cannot add ten catties. He is limited. He is not unlimited in the things he can carry. He can carry fifty catties and cannot add ten more. These fifty catties are the things in his hands. This is an analogy. The strength of our outer man is limited, just as the strength of our body is limited.</P><P>Many people realize that the strength of their body is limited. But they do not see that the strength of their outer man is also limited. As a result, they squander and waste the strength of their outer man. Suppose a person expends all his love on his parents. He will have no strength to love the brothers or to love all men. He only has so much strength, and when he has exhausted his strength, he has no more strength to spend on other things.</P><P>A man's mental strength is also limited. No one has an unlimited supply of mental energy. If a man spends more time in one thing, that is, if his mind is set fully on one thing, he will have no strength to think about other things. Romans 8 tells us that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death. Why then is the law of the Spirit of life not working in some people? The Bible also shows us that the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to the spirit. In other words, the law of the Spirit of life only has an effect on those who are spiritual. The spiritual ones are those who set their mind on spiritual things. Those who set their mind on spiritual things do not have their mind set on the flesh. Only those who do not set their mind on the flesh can set their mind on spiritual things. The expression setting the mind on can also be translated as "paying attention to" or "taking care of." Suppose a mother leaves the house and entrusts her young child to a friend, saying, "Please take care of her for me." What does it mean to take care of the child? It means to pay attention to her all the time. A man can only pay attention to one thing; he cannot pay attention to two things at the same time. If a person commits a child to our care, we cannot take care of it on the one hand and take care of the sheep and cows on the mountain on the other hand. If we take care of the child, we cannot take care of anything else. Only those who do not take care of the things of the flesh are able to take care of the things of the spirit, and only those who take care of the things of the spirit receive the benefit of the law of the Spirit. Our mental strength is limited. If we waste our mental strength on the things of the flesh, we will not have enough mental energy to take care of the things of the spirit. If we set our mind on the things of the flesh, we will have no further strength to set our mind on the things of the spirit.</P><P>We must be very clear about this one thing: Our outer man is limited in strength, in the same way that our two arms are limited in their strength. Therefore, if there are already things in our hands, we cannot take up God's things. How much we have in our hands is inversely proportional to the power we have in our service to God. The things we have in our hands are a great hindrance, a very great frustration.</P><P>Suppose a man has "things in his hands" with respect to his emotion. He has all kinds of distracting desires and expectations. He wants and craves many things. He has so many things in his hands. When God has need of him, he has no emotions to spare because all of his emotions are used up. If he has used up all of his emotions within the last two days, he will be unable to feel or say anything for another two days. Our emotions are limited; we cannot draw from them endlessly.</P><P>Some people have a strong will; they are very determined. We may think that they have unlimited strength in their will. But even the strongest person finds himself with a wavering will when it comes to making a decision before the Lord. He will wonder if one choice is as good as another. He may appear to be a strong person, but when a situation calls for the genuine exercise of the will in the course of God's business, he cannot do it. Many people like to express their opinions. They have an opinion for everything. One minute they have one opinion; the next minute they have another opinion. They are never short of opinions. But when it comes to making a judgment on God's will, they are very hesitant. They are lost and cannot decide because their outer man is full of "things in the hands." There are too many things before their eyes and in their hands. Their entire person is consumed by these things, and all the strength of their outer man is used up and gone.</P><P>We must see that the strength of our outer man is limited. As soon as we have things in our hands, our outer man is bound.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
