<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Advising the People of Judah<br>to Listen to His Word<br>and Turn from Their Evil Way</H2><P>Jeremiah advised the people of Judah, including the priests and the prophets, to listen to his word and to turn from their evil way (vv. 3-7). Otherwise, Jehovah would make the temple like Shiloh (7:12-14; 1 Sam. 4:10-11) and the city of Jerusalem a curse to all the nations of the earth. If Israel did not listen, repent, and turn, their destiny would be like that of Shiloh, which was defeated and destroyed, and they would become a curse to the nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Priests, the Prophets,<br>and All the People Seizing Jeremiah</H2><P>The priests, the prophets, and all the people seized Jeremiah, saying, "You will surely die!" (Jer. 26:8-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jeremiah Speaking<br>to All the Princes and All the People</H2><P>Jeremiah answered and said that Jehovah had sent him to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words which they had heard. Then he told them to amend their ways and deeds and listen to the voice of Jehovah their God, and Jehovah would repent of the evil He had spoken against them (vv. 12-13). Regarding himself, Jeremiah went on to say, "But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right in your eyes. Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon her inhabitants; for truly Jehovah has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears" (vv. 14-15). Jeremiah's attitude here was excellent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Princes and All the People<br>Speaking to the Priests and to the Prophets</H2><P>The princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets that Jeremiah was not worthy of a sentence of death, for he had spoken to them in the name of Jehovah their God (v. 16).</P>
