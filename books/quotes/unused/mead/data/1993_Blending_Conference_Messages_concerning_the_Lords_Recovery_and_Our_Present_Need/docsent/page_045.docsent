   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Apostle Also Charging Us to Stand</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in One Spirit and Strive with One Soul</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>for the Gospel, Thinking the Same One Thing, Having the Same Love, Joined in One Soul</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Triune God is absolutely one in Himself, that is, in His being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no possibility of any problem among the three of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Also, spiritually speaking, there is no possibility of any problem in our spirit, because we are those who are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in our day-to-day practical experience in the church life we may have some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These problems are not in our spirit, but they are in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of this, in Philippians 1:27 the apostle Paul besought the Philippian believers, "Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the presence of the apostle may fluctuate, the Lord is with us all the time; His presence is continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, whether the apostle is present or not, our conduct should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should stand firm in one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the apostle heard of the believers' conduct, he wanted to hear that they were standing firm in their mingled human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a sense, this is not difficult to do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the apostle also charged the believers to strive together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians say that they are standing in one spirit, yet they may say this in a way of "shaking hands over the fence."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our firm standing must be in our human spirit, yet we must also strive together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we stand firmly in our mingled human spirit, our spirit has a way to control and direct our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In such a situation our soul does not govern our being, but our spirit governs our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When our souls are under the direction of our spirit, we can be one to strive together like a team of athletes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our being in one soul is an issue of the mingled spirit spreading out to transform our soul so that the oneness that is in our spirit even enters into our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our whole being is in the oneness because we are saturated with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is absolutely one, and His saturation makes us one in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This produces a harmony that can be seen by men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This oneness and this harmony has a particular taste.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It has the taste of God, because it is something that issues out of God's very being, out of God's very nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2:2 the apostle again besought the believers, "Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The apostle's joy is made full when he sees that all the churches all over the world are practicing this kind of oneness, a oneness in which they are thinking the same thing, even the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord can accomplish His purpose for the satisfaction of His heart's desire only when we are thinking the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also need to have the same love for all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Again this involves our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may feel that some of the saints in our locality are not lovable, but there is One within us who has the ability to love all the saints in the church with the same love, without any discrimination based on nationality, class, culture, personality, or language.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Outside of Christ we do not have the ability to love all the saints with the same love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when the Christ who is in our spirit saturates our entire being, all the saints are lovely to us, and we can love them all with the same love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also need to be joined in soul, thinking the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to the context of Philippians, the one thing here must be the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 4:2-3 two sisters, Euodias and Syntyche, were not thinking the same thing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that they were not joined in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the apostle Paul exhorted them specifically to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is only by our pursuing the subjective experience of Christ and allowing Him to saturate our entire soul with the element of the Triune God that we can think the same thing and be joined in soul.</S>
