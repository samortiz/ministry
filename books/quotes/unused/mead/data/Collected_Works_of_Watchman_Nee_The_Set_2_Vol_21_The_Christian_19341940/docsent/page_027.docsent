   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE PARABLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THINGS NEW AND OLD 1 Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>9 and 10 Scripture Reading: Matt 9:9-17; Luke 5:27-39</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these two passages the Lord mentions five parables.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may think that there are only two parables: the new garment and the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But according to the record of Luke, there are five closely related parables.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These five parables deal with: 1 the unfulled cloth, 2 the old garment, 3 the new wine, 4 the old wine, and 5 "no one who has drunk the old desires the new, for he says, The old is better."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us consider how these five parables show us the salvation that God has prepared for us in His Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE REASON FOR THE PARABLES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The records of Matthew and Luke reveal that while He was journeying the Lord met Matthew, who was Levi, the tax collector, sitting at the tax office.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord said to him, "Follow Me," and he followed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Friends, can you follow a man just at his words "Follow me"?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a stranger were to come to you and ask you to follow him, would you do it?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You surely would not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There must have been something unusual about this man that attracted Matthew like a magnet and that forced him to give up his former living, wealth, and everything to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew did not understand why there was such power behind this man's word, that made him forsake his sinful living and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This One turns men to repentance and salvation the minute they meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the voice of this One, the dead receive life, and at the call of this One, men follow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This man caused Matthew not only to give up his position, but also to open up his home and prepare a feast for his friends and relatives; even strangers were invited to dine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While they were attending the feast, the Pharisees and the scribes became jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They asked why Jesus and His disciples ate and drank.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only did they eat, but they ate with the publicans and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They began to condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet they dared not ask Jesus directly, for they knew that if they asked Him, they would be embarrassed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They could only criticize the Lord's disciples behind their back, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The disciples could not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps even they did not understand why the Lord did this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord did not tell the disciples why He went to the house of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when the Lord heard this, He answered, "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners" Matt 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the purpose for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did not go to the house of the publican because the opportunity arose for Him to go, nor was He compelled to change His mind because of the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not eat with sinners and publicans through a coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He came with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The words "I did not come to call" imply that His coming was with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His incarnation was with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His walk and His healing were with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He did not do anything or say anything haphazardly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His life was not purposeless.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said that He came with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not come because He saw the nation of Israel or the Gentiles behaving in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not change God's purpose because of changes in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seemed as if He was saying, "You think that I communicate with the sinners because I was invited by the publicans and the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, this was the purpose of My coming from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I came to call the sinners to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the purpose of My coming."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is like saying that I came from Nanking purposely to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I did not come to Shanghai just en route to Soochow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus came to the world for an express purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He did not change His original plan; He did not adjust His plan or alter His reason for coming into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His actions on earth were a demonstration of His original intention for coming to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He had the intention from the beginning of doing what He did.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether in opening the eyes of the blind or in cleansing the lepers, He worked because it was His original intention to work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His actions were not an alteration of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Pharisees were very clever.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They could be the teacher of many people, but they could not be the teacher of one Person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may also be very clever and may qualify to be the teacher of your friends, your relatives, and even us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But you cannot be the Lord Jesus' teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You are not qualified for that.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You cannot say that the Lord Jesus has eaten too much, or that He has done something wrong, because He knows what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eating at the house of the publicans and sinners was something that He foreordained.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He did not do this mindlessly, and you cannot say anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This was His decision, His original intention.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We human beings have one weakness: we often talk to others for an hour or two hours and do not know what we are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do things without knowing why we did them, and we are bewildered at what we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Perhaps you think that just because there are times when you do not know what you are doing or saying, the Lord Jesus is also the same.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Pharisees thought that just because they did not know what they were doing or saying, the Lord Jesus would be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, the Lord does not do anything foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said that He did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did everything with a purpose; He is never haphazard.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Why did He do this?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He said that He did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, He said that those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Why did the Lord say this?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I have said that after the law came, many people still did not know what the law was.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many people think that the law is just a few commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Actually, the law is not just the Ten Commandments; it is what God demands of man, and what man ought to give to God based on His demands.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God has demands, and man has to fulfill these demands; this is the meaning of keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The purpose of the law is for man to break it and be stumbled on it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God gave us the law, not for man to keep, but for him to break and be stumbled upon.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Are you surprised by this?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is not surprising at all.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Scripture says that the law was added because of transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The law merely shows man that he cannot render anything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God knows that man is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But man does not know that he is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, God gave the law in order for man to break it, so that he would know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The law was given by God through Moses with the intention that man would realize that he cannot keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Friends, do you think that the Lord Jesus is ignorant of this?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Since the law was given to expose man's inability to keep God's law, would the Son of God come to the world to ask man to keep what he cannot keep?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If the law cannot stop man from sin, would the Son of God require man to do what he cannot do?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Since the law cannot save a man, would God give us His Son, whose work is to save man, to cause man not to be saved instead?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If the law cannot save man, would the Son of God come, only to find that man is still not saved?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God sent His Son in order that man would be saved through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In other words, we were all ill.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>What then should God do?</S>
