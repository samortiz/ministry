   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need of Thorough Confession</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are going to rise up, we have to repent and make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some may say that they were saved years ago and have already been forgiven of all their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, you cannot say that because you washed your hands two weeks ago that you do not need to wash your hands anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Neither can you say that you took a shower two months ago so there is no need for you to take another shower.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even after half a day, you need to wash again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In like manner, you need to make a thorough confession of all your shortcomings, weaknesses, wrongdoings, and sinfulness to have a conscience without offense toward God and men Acts 24:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man may not know what you have been doing, but God surely knows.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Matthew 12:36-37, every man shall have to render an account in the day of judgment of every idle word which they speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is possible to deceive man, but you cannot deceive God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we mean business with Him we need to repent and make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It would be wonderful if all of us could spend one or two hours with the Lord personally to make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I once spent more than two hours in fellowship with the Lord to make a thorough confession and that was after I had been saved for at least ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is always better to make such a confession by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not make confession corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Corporate confession is not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can never make a thorough confession corporately because you are afraid of other people hearing you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need a private time to confess everything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not need to be afraid of Him knowing our sins since He knows them all already.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since He knows the record of all our sinful doings, it is best for us to ask Him to rid us of that record by confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of us need this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to go by rising up we need to make a thorough confession, a fine, detailed confession.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to confess all the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if you were unhappy with a brother, you have to confess that unhappiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you were unhappy with your wife, you need the confession of that unhappiness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have to confess all your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not go to the Lord in a rough way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not sufficient to tell the Lord, Lord, You know I am sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I don t have the time to confess everything, but thank You that You shed Your blood and Your blood washes me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to have a fine forgiveness, you must make a fine confession, confessing to the Lord in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone who has done this and who does this can testify that after a thorough confession they are filled with the Spirit within and clothed with the Spirit without.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They have the inward, essential filling of the Spirit and the outward, economical filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible tells us clearly that the essential Spirit has been breathed into the believers of Christ and that the economical Spirit has been poured out upon His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since we are members of His Body, surely the pouring out of the Spirit is our inheritance, our lot, our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some Christians separate the Spirit from the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, God the Father is embodied in the Son and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Son is the embodiment of the Triune God and the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we have this consummated Triune God within us and upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to believe this and take it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not need to beg Him to give us the Holy Spirit since the Holy Spirit has been given already.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What we need to do is make a thorough repentance with a thorough confession before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then experientially we will be filled within and without with the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we will rise up and become so buoyant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to go by rising up and by being filled with the consummated Spirit essentially and economically.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are filled by repenting and obeying.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All of us need to have a solid time with the Lord to make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A husband and a wife can even make an agreement with one another that they are going to have such a time and would not like to be disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you are having such a time it is best to take the phone off the hook.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Find some place in your house or somewhere else where you can be alone to make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to mean business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to go by rising up and we need to make a thorough confession that we would be filled with the divine air that we would be brought into the divine air.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, we are filled within with the essential Spirit and filled without with the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will be buoyant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If this confessing and repenting become our practice, we will always come to the meetings buoyant.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is a hymn which says, There s a Man in the glory...How buoyant is He!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hymns, #505 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you make such a thorough confession to the Lord, you will be buoyant for at least three days.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you find yourself becoming not so buoyant, then make a thorough confession again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to confess thoroughly all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before coming to minister the Word, I always exercise to get myself thoroughly cleansed in the Lord s precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is why I am buoyant in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we become buoyant, we go.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Letting Nothing Dim Our Vision</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verses three and four of Hymns, #890 say:</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ is Victor,</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore do and dare;</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Go wherever Jesus sends you</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In prevailing prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ is Victor,</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No defeat nor fear</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Evermore must dim thy vision!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ the way will clear.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not let anything dim our vision or make our vision weak.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Too often we let something dim our vision and make our vision so vague.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we would confess our sins thoroughly, this thorough confession would clear the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then our vision could never be dim.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Go wherever He would send you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do not let anything dim your vision.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Go by rising up and being filled with the consummated Spirit essentially and economically.</S>
