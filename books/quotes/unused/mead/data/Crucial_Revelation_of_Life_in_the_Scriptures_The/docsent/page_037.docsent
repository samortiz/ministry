   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BREATH OF LIFE COMING INTO THE DRY BONES TO ACCOMPLISH GOD'S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These bones needed a further prophecy so that the breath of life could come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ezekiel prophesied again, "And the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army" 37:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bones first became a body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the breath came into the bones and they lived.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they stood up, they became an exceeding great army to fight the battle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The bones become the army fighting the battle, and eventually they become the habitation for God's dwelling to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The army is for the dominion to deal with God's enemy, and the dwelling place is for the expression, the image, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the breathing of the Spirit, God is expressed and His enemy is dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ezekiel prophesies twice in chapter thirty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first time he prophesied to the bones and the second time to the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First he prophesied to the dead ones and second he prophesied to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord charged Ezekiel to prophesy a second time and say, "Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live" v. 9 . Then the bones that were formed into a body received the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They stood up upon their feet and were formed into an army to fight the battle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This also gave God the ground to build them together as His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The army and the house fulfill God's twofold purpose to deal with His enemy and to express Him in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Image and dominion are brought in by the breathing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE BREATH OF LIFE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament, the Gospel of John tells us that the Lord Jesus came back on the evening of His resurrection to the disciples 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He breathed into them and told them to receive the Holy Pneuma v. 22 . Again, the word pneuma may be translated into Spirit or breath.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord breathed into the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Breath.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today the Lord in His resurrection is the breath of life, the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In John 3 the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus that the Spirit is like the wind, which blows where it wills and cannot be seen but can be realized by its sound John 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the day of Pentecost, "there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind" Acts 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This rushing, violent wind was the blowing of the Spirit, the blowing of the heavenly ruach or pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Revelation 11:11 tells us that the two witnesses, after being dead for three and a half days, were resurrected by the spirit of life out of God entering into them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The breath of life will come into the two witnesses and resurrect them during the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second Thessalonians 2:8 tells us that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will slay the Antichrist by the breath of His mouth, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The breath of life gives life to us, but kills the lawless one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second Timothy 3:16 tells us that all Scripture is God- breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that the Scripture, the Word of God, is the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's speaking is God's breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is breath to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this breath is the water, and in this water is the food.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are going to enjoy God as food, we have to drink Him as the water.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To drink Him as the water, we have to breathe Him as our breath.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By breathing in the Lord, we drink Him and we eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can drink Him anywhere and eat Him anywhere because we can breathe Him in anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our spiritual food and drink are available to us at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Physically speaking, we can breathe everywhere, but we cannot drink and eat everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But spiritually speaking, we can eat and drink everywhere because our spiritual eating is in our drinking, and the drinking is in the breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we receive the Lord as the divine air, we enjoy Him as the living water and the heavenly food.</S>
