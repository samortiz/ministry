<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Delegated Authority in the Leading Ones</H2><P>The New Testament shows us God's delegated authority in the leading ones in the ministry. In a family there is delegated authority, and in human government there is also delegated authority. Without delegated authorities, the whole earth would be in anarchy and disorder and would be unsuitable to live in. Today a wind of teaching is blowing in the Lord's recovery saying that there is no delegated authority in the church. According to this teaching Brother Nee was wrong in his book Authority and Submission. If Brother Nee was wrong, the Bible is also wrong because the Bible strongly reveals God's delegated authority in the church life and in the ministry.</P><P>God's delegated authority in the leading ones in the ministry was for building up and not for overthrowing (2 Cor. 13:10). Paul had authority, not to destroy or overthrow, but for building up. God's delegated authority was in the teaching of the leading ones (1 Cor. 4:17b-21; 7:17b; 16:1; 11:2; 2 Thes. 3:6, 9, 12, 14). Paul exercised his authority in his teaching. He taught the same thing everywhere in every church (1 Cor. 4:17b), and the churches followed his speaking. This was the demonstration of Paul's delegated authority. Authority always follows the proper speaking. A teacher's speaking in a school is with authority. When the teacher speaks, all the students are under his authority.</P><P>The leadership in the ministry was in the leading ones' dealing with the problems and affairs of the churches (1 Cor. 1:10; 5:11-13; 11:34b). Paul was strong in dealing with the church in Corinth. In 1 Corinthians 4:21 he said, "What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness?" In 11:34 he said, "And the rest I will set in order when I come."</P><P>The leadership in the ministry was also in the leading ones' punishing of the saints' disobedience. In 2 Corinthians 10:6 Paul said, "We are ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled." Paul intended to punish all disobedience when the Corinthians themselves had learned obedience.</P><P>The leadership in the ministry was also in the appointing of and dealing with the elders (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5; 1 Tim. 5:19-20). First Timothy 5:19-20 shows that not only did the apostles have the authority to appoint the elders, but they also had the authority to judge them, including the authority to remove them. This shows us that the apostles were the delegated authority of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S GOVERNMENT<br>IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCHES</H2><P>Even among the children of Israel in the Old Testament, God had a government for His administration to fulfill His purpose. God also has His government in the administration of the churches in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Autocracy nor Democracy, but Theocracy</H2><P>God's government is neither autocracy nor democracy, but theocracy. Autocracy is dictatorship, and democracy is government by the people. Humanly speaking, democracy is wonderful, but to bring democracy into the church brings in the opinions of the people. This is like the church in Laodicea in Revelation 3. The word Laodicea in Greek means "the opinion of the people." In the United States government, congressmen and senators represent the states to express the people's opinion. God's government in the church is not like this. God's government in the church is theocratic.</P>
