   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE GOD'S VESSEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SPECIAL CONFERENCE 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Date:Evening, December 26, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place:Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Scripture Reading: Phil 2:12-13; 3:8-10 note the words "obeyed" and "operates" in 2:12-13 MAN'S SPECIFIC USE TO BE FILLED WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man is a specific creature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is created for a specific use.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A light bulb can only shine when it is placed in the proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If it is not placed in the proper place, it will not shine; if the bulb could speak, it would tell you that it was senseless that it should be there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same way, unless a man exists for a specific purpose, that man is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man's specific use is to be filled with God, in the same way that the light bulb is used to shine forth light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this universe, man should be filled with God and should shine for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people are filled with money, education, family, and position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But after they are filled with these things, they are still empty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lands and houses are but turmoils and headaches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man does not live for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The specific purpose of man's living is God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether a person is young or old, rich or poor, male or female, as soon as a person touches God, he is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GOD'S PURPOSE IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FOR MAN TO CONTAIN HIM AND TO EXPRESS HIM</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within every one of us, we need God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without God, we feel empty, unsatisfied, and sad.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God needs us also.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He needs us more than we need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God not only created man; He also sought man out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After Adam fell, God asked him, "Where are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord came, He came to seek and to save the lost sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the story of the prodigal son, we see God's need for man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The father needed the son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Parents need their children more than the children need their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why did God create man, love him, and save him?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some say that God is love, and that He has prepared many places in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They say that if we do not go to heaven, heaven will be empty: "All things are ready; come to the feast" this is the calling of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But what is the purpose of God's loving us and saving us?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's purpose is to receive glory through man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His purpose is to express His life through us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a light bulb is connected to the electric current, it shines forth light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the meaning of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God enters you and is expressed through you, it is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God desires that we be filled with Him within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every saved believer has God within him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to see this before the Lord, and we need to present ourselves to God in this way to be His vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>CONSECRATION NOT FOR GOD'S WORK,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>BUT TO BE GOD'S VESSEL</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times we want to do this and that kind of work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have been to a number of places in northern and central China, and I have seen some very zealous workers for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although they are very zealous, few among them know that they are God's vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To them, there is not much difference between being God's vessel and working for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But I have to say that there is a big difference between being zealous for God and being God's vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To those among you who have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, I would like to ask a question: "Why did you consecrate yourselves to the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God wants us to be His vessels so that He can put Himself inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>GOD'S WAY</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>CALLING MAN TO BE HIS VESSELS</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is natural for us to work much for God and to save souls.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are over one million people in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there are ten or twenty brothers and sisters here who are filled with God within, in two to three years, you will definitely see many people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But more than that, those who will be saved will be very different from those who are saved today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As long as God fills Hong Kong, blessings will be here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I arrived here on Tuesday December 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By now I have been here three to four days already.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have met many brothers and sisters who are very zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I would like to ask if among these many brothers and sisters there are some who are God's vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here is an elderly sister.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She has been meeting with us from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let me ask, "What are you doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Are you here merely to meet, to listen to messages, and to pray?"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If that is what you are doing here, God cannot have a way here; He will not be able to spread out from here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is why in the past there have been so many revival meetings, spiritual conferences, and other meetings, and yet after these meetings are over, no one has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the nineteenth century, there were many conventions, sermons, conferences, and revivals.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But these things are not God's way today.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only when some answer God's call will God have a way today.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There are those who are zealous for God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are also those who work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But how many are there who will truly answer God's call?</S>
