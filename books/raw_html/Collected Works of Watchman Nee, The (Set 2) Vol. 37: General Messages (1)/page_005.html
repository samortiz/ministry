<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">BLESSINGS THAT CAN BE ENJOYED TODAY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 49:10; Rev. 7:9-17</h1><p>These two passages mention a few kinds of blessings: (1) not hungering or thirsting, (2) not having the scorching heat nor sun strike them, (3) being guided to springs of water, and (4) God wiping away every tear. The first three blessings are mentioned in both passages, while the fourth is mentioned only in Revelation.</p><p>Revelation records a great multitude which no one could number standing before the throne and before the Lamb. John did not understand who they were. Later, one of the elders asked him, "These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?" (Rev. 7:13). John answered, "My lord, you know" (v. 14). The elder then said, "These are those who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (v. 14). He also told John the four kinds of blessings these ones have.</p><p>Revelation 4:2 says, "There was a throne set in heaven." The throne is in heaven. To say that these people are standing before the throne means that these ones are in heaven. How do they move from earth to heaven? Who are they? These ones are "clothed in white robes" with "palm branches in their hands." Palm branches signify victory. Hence, they are the overcoming believers who are raptured to heaven.</p><p>"These are those who come out of the great tribulation." The "great tribulation" here is not the great tribulation of the three and a half years but the "affliction" referred to by the Lord when He says, "In the world you have affliction" (John 16:33). It is called the "great tribulation" because the twelve apostles, Stephen, Paul, and all the ones who came after them suffered the same tribulation.</p><p>These overcoming believers will enjoy a few special blessings. They stand before the throne of God; this means that these blessings are eternal blessings in the heavenlies. It is obvious that Revelation 7:16-17 speaks of the condition in eternity.</p><p>Apparently, the blessings mentioned in Isaiah 49:10 are the same as the ones mentioned here. Actually, there are some differences. What are the differences? Isaiah 49:6 says, "It is too small a thing that You would be My Servant/To raise up the tribes of Jacob/And bring back the preserved of Israel;/I will also set You as a light of the nations/That You may be My salvation unto the ends of the earth." Has this verse been fulfilled yet? Acts 13:47 says, "I have set you as a light of the Gentiles, that you would be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth." From this we see that Isaiah 49:6 has been fulfilled. God has made Jesus Christ the light of the Gentiles. This is a picture of today. This is the condition of the age of the gospel.</p><p>Furthermore, Isaiah 49:8 says, "In an acceptable time I have answered You,/And in a day of salvation I have helped You." If we compare this with 2 Corinthians 6:2, we will see that Isaiah 49:8 also refers to the present time.</p><p>Since Isaiah 49:6 and 8 refer to the present time, we can say that verse 10 must also refer to the present time. This is in contrast with Revelation 7, which refers to eternity future.</p><p>God does not expect us to enjoy these blessings only when we reach heaven. He expects us to have a foretaste of heaven even now. Although we cannot have a full taste of it, at least we can enjoy three-quarters of it. We know that when we reach heaven, surely we will not hunger or thirst anymore or suffer the heat but will be guided to the springs of water. Why then do we not believe that we can enjoy these things today? God says that we can enjoy these three kinds of blessings even today!</p><p>These ones "will come from a distance/...from the north and the west/And others from the land of the Sinim" (Isa. 49:12). While they are suffering on the way, God promises that "they will not hunger or thirst;/Neither the scorching heat nor the sun will strike them;/For He who has compassion on them will lead them/And will guide them beside the springs of water." God has given us such wonderful promises. We are these pilgrims; we have left our earthly homes and are on our way to the New Jerusalem.</p>
