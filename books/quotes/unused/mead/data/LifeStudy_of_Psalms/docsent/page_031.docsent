   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Asking God to Vindicate His Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>David asked God to vindicate his righteousness based upon the past experience of his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He convinced others that he was a godly man whom God set apart for Himself and who called out to Jehovah and whom Jehovah heard when he called out to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He also admonished others not to sin in anger but to consider in their heart upon their bed and be silent Psa 4:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When he was fleeing from his son, he still asked God to vindicate him of his righteousness, but where was his righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>David should not have prayed this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, he should have asked God to enlighten him so that he could see how evil and sinful he was.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a king, he killed one of his fighters by his conspiracy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then after killing him, he robbed him of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where was his righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He also was convincing others that he was a godly man whom God set apart for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was fleeing, yet he considered that he was set apart by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows that he was in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In considering Psalm 4, we need to remember that this was a psalm written by David at the time when he was fleeing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, he indicated that he was a godly man whom God had set apart for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Was that the time for him to pray in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This shows that we human beings always are not easily convinced of or subdued in our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if we murdered someone and committed fornication by robbing, we would not be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We still would think we are good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We might vindicate ourselves by saying, "Yes, maybe I was wrong in certain matters, but I am a godly person whom God has set apart for Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have been touching people for sixty years in the Lord's recovery, but I have nearly never had a time with one who was thoroughly convinced by God of his failures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the law court, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant think that they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They cannot be convinced that they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need God's mercy to see our failures, our sinfulness, and our filthiness, to even roll on the floor in confession of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that we have received mercy and found grace in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as we would not be convinced of our sinfulness, we are wrong and in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Psalm 4 David even admonished others not to sin in anger but to consider in their heart upon their bed and be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a good teaching, but why did David not teach himself?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Was he the right person to pray this way?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you know his background, you can see that he was not the right person.</S>
