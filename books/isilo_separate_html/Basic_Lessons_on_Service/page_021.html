Addressing Praise<br>to the Lord Jesus Christ,<br>the Son of God</H2><P>In the section of remembering the Lord, all our praises should be addressed directly to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Realizing the Economy of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>To address our praises directly to the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, we need to realize the economy of the Divine Trinity. Matthew 28:19b says that we are baptized into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. Second Corinthians 13:14 refers to the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit. These verses reveal the economy of the Divine Trinity to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Learning to Differentiate<br>the Lord's Names from the Father's Names</H2><P>We need to learn to differentiate the Lord's names from the Father's names. In our personal time it would be good to read Hymns, #65 through #80, concerning the names of the Lord. In order to address or praise the Lord Himself directly, we need to know His names.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Calling Hymns</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Learning to Know the Hymns</H2><P>In order to call the appropriate hymns in the table meeting, we need to learn to know the hymns first in their categories. The table of contents in our hymnal can help us with this, since it categorizes all of the hymns. Then we need to read and even to study the contents of the hymns. We also need to find out the central thought, the focus, of each hymn. Finally, we need to know the hymns in their sensation and taste. Each hymn has its own sensation, so it has its own taste. When you know the hymns in these four aspects&#151;in their categories, contents, focus, and sensation and taste&#151;you know the hymns thoroughly.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
