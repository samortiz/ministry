   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to consider how to have the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have said, we Christians should be "crazy" all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should be "crazy" with the Lord, filled up with His Spirit and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we will attend any meeting in a "crazy" way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not go to a meeting like a "flat tire," without being filled with the Spirit and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why we need to have a new revival every morning so that we can be revived persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we need to continue to exercise our spirit to be overcoming and victorious every day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to attend every meeting as revived persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The meeting should actually start before we leave our home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should go to the group gathering singing and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While we are on the way to meet with the saints, we may sing, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have passed the riven veil, Here the glories never fail" Hymns, #551 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we arrive at the meeting place, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to our old way, we would sit there in silence and wait for the meeting to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the "crazy way" is not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should start the meeting in our home, singing and praying in the car on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we come into the meeting place, we should continue to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When others come, they can join our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the prayer, someone may share that a certain brother lost his job today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then there can be some prayer for this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fellowship brings in the interceding, the interceding brings in the mutual care, and the mutual care brings in the practical shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After praying for the brother who lost his job, someone may ask what his profession is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then another brother may say that his company needs such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is an example of mutual care and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will make everyone living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone feels free and has the boldness to share something.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Following this fellowship and interceding, questions will be asked.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No one should be assigned to answer these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone should answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Someone may ask what the cross is, and a young brother who was saved just three weeks ago can answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He may say, "Formerly I did not know what the cross was.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But just recently a brother told me that it was a means used by the Roman government to put to death the worst criminals."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His answer is a short teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another brother may continue by saying, "The cross was where the Lord Jesus was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was crucified there on behalf of us to take away our sins."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then he may read one verse referring to this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Another brother may say, "When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was crucified not only for our sins but also for us."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He would also give a verse to support what he has shared.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Another brother can add something more by saying, "Today we have to experience the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can experience the cross by applying the death of Christ on the cross to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are about to lose our temper, we need to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This brings us into the death of Christ in the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This brother may then continue to share something further concerning the experience of the cross of Christ.</S>
