   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREPARATION MESSAGES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE 4 THE PRAYER THAT COOPERATES WITH GOD Scripture Reading: Isa 62:6; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>36:37; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>14 The Principle of God's Work</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God works along certain lines and according to certain principles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He does not do things haphazardly or carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He would rather not work than have work that is done contrary to His principle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to receive His blessings, we have to fulfill the conditions for Him to bless.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God transcends all principles and rules.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet He likes to lay down principles for His work so that both He and man would abide by these ordained principles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's principle is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God never works by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He always puts His desire in His children's heart so that they would pray for it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mr. Evan Roberts said that the order of all God's works is:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1 God has a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 Through the Holy Spirit, He puts this desire within His children's hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 God's children turn this desire back to God through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4 God accomplishes this desire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The whole thing begins with God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through the Holy Spirit, God puts this desire in the hearts of His children so that they will know what is His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His children then turn this desire into prayer and send it back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, He works to accomplish that which is according to His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ezekiel 36:37 says, "Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 God ordained that the number in the house of Israel be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God's decision and what He will do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the first point and also the fourth point mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2 But God still has to be inquired of by the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although God made the decision to increase the number of the house of Israel, He could only accomplish it after He had been inquired of by the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the principle of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God only has His will; He does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He must wait until His children inquire of Him and then He will work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is not trying to hold back on any of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is waiting for His children to inquire of Him before He will work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is willing to put Himself under the authority of and be limited by His children's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they do not pray, He cannot work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For over twenty-five hundred years, God has not increased the number of the house of Israel because no one has inquired this of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Isaiah 62:6 says, "Upon Your walls, O Jerusalem,/I have appointed watchmen; /All day and all night/They will never keep silent./You who remind Jehovah,/Do not be dumb"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1 God has ordained that Jerusalem would be a praise in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2 For this He has set watchmen to cry out to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He told them not to hold their peace and to give Him no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should pray continually and not rest until God accomplishes what He has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The carrying out of God's will is fully determined by our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Philemon 14 says, "But without your mind I did not want to do anything, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but voluntary."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul represents God, and Philemon represents us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul would not do anything without knowing Philemon's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God will not do anything without knowing our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His will is limited by us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Prayer Being the Tracks of God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Mr. Gordon Watts once said that God's will is like a locomotive, while our prayers are like the tracks.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The locomotive is powerful, but it can only run on the tracks.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's will is powerful, but it needs our prayer as the tracks before His will can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God would not work alone; He has to wait for His children's will to agree with His will before He will work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are three wills in the universe: God's will, man's will, and Satan's will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God does not remove Satan's will by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He desires that man's will become one with His will, to deal with Satan's will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A spiritual prayer is an utterance of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How useless is a prayer that merely utters one's own will!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our prayer cannot change God's will; it merely expresses His will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God is the initiator of everything; we are merely the channel through which His will can flow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God ordains, and we obey.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He initiates, and we agree in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot force God to do what He does not want to do, but we can stop Him from doing what He does want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When God's will is turned into our prayer, He will begin working.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every revival comes from prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our prayer cannot change God's will; it only speaks out His will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No one can direct God's will, and no one can make Him do what He does not want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, what He does want to do can be limited by man's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although Pentecost was prophesied by God in the book of Joel, there had to be the prayer of the one hundred and twenty before He could accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God's will reaches only as far as our prayers have reached.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, the more thorough our prayers are, the more the will of God will be accomplished, and Satan's deceptions will not be able to come in. We should cast a net of prayer "by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time" Eph 6:18 , so that God's will can prevail in all areas, and Satan will not find one crack through which to come in. In our prayer we should pay attention to three things: 1 to whom we are praying, 2 for whom we are praying, and 3 against whom we are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All our prayers should fulfill God's will, afford others a profit, and inflict Satan with a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Afternoon, January 23</S>
