<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM <br>TSOU COUNTY, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Miss Lee:</P><P>God's grace is sufficient for us. So we can only thank and praise concerning all the work and affairs. The temptation and pressure are great, but the grace is even greater. It seems that the Lord has opened a door for us recently. Mr. Yang, the chief guard at the Tsou County Official Prison came of his own accord to invite us into the prison to preach the gospel to the prisoners. We are just about to begin, and we are very much exercised about this endeavor. There are also some who are in one accord with us praying unceasingly for this matter. We are requesting prayer co-workers. If the brothers or sisters there have any teaching or direction from experience in this kind of work, we would be most happy to hear it.</P><P>I am still here in Tsou County and will not leave here for a while. It seems that in following the Lord, the more I learn, the more I am walking against the wind; each step is an effort. I am also very surprised that such a weak and corrupted person as I can still stand here today. This truly is the Lord's grace. May the Lord bless you with peace.</P><P>Sincerely,<br>Sun Shih Pi<br>October 26, 1933</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM TAISHAN, KWANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>To Sister Ruth Lee in the Lord:</P><P>(Parts omitted.) I am still teaching. When I have time, I do the Lord's work. Only three of the brothers in Taishan remember the Lord with us. Among them is Brother T'ang Yen Min. After Brother Lee (Brother Lee Pei Shun) came to Taishan, he read the first volume of The Spiritual Man and learned that denominations were a sin. He immediately left the denomination and his position as a preacher. Now he lives at 28 Kung Ho Market, Second Floor. He has a wife and children, so his daily expenses are great. He is not from a wealthy family. He has always been a professional preacher. Now that he has been called, he lives by faith in God. Thank God, He has given us a brother to bear the responsibility!</P><P>There are more than twenty people who break bread together with us here. There are sisters who are in their sixties and seventies and some who are in their teens. There are some who walk more than ten miles [Translator's note: References to miles in Volumes 25 and 26 refer to the Chinese unit of measurement, which is the approximate equivalent of one-third of a Western mile] on the Lord's Day to come to Kung Ho Market for the meeting. Although the roads in the rural country are very rough, they do not mind. This is the Lord's love! The brothers and sisters in Taishan are all at peace. Please do not worry!</P><P>Brother Lee has left the world to be with the Lord, and there is no better place to be. But we believers in Kwantung province have lost much help. May the brothers and sisters in Shanghai always remember us in prayer, praying and petitioning for us so that many believers in Taishan and Canton would have some raised up to bear the burden in the Lord's name.</P><P>We know a brother, who is twenty this year, called Liang Huei Hung. He is also in one accord with us. He lives in Canton. When Brother Lee was there, he did his best to help this brother. The brother's wife is not in the denominations. Unfortunately, this brother died ten days ago! In the past two months, we have lost two good brothers. We are very grieved. May God the Father preserve us, so that we may serve the Lord faithfully until we are raptured. Amen. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>Your sister,<br>Wei Shih<br>November 4, 1933</P>
