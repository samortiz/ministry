   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Accomplish His All-inclusive Judicial Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His full ministry in the first stage of His incarnation, Christ accomplished four great things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, He brought the infinite God into the finite man; second, He united and mingled the Triune God with the tripartite man; third, He expressed the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues; and fourth, eventually, He accomplished His all-inclusive judicial redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first two things were concerning His birth, the third thing was concerning His human living, and the fourth thing was concerning His death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After He passed through His human living, He went to die on the cross for the accomplishment of His all-inclusive judicial redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The all-inclusive judicial redemption of Christ is of five aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, He terminated all things of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, He redeemed all the things created by God and fallen in sin Heb 2:9; Col 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything belonging to the old creation was terminated by Christ through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After this termination, He redeemed back all the things created by God and fallen in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, He created conceived the new man with His divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 2:15 says that on the cross He created the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers in Himself into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That creation was a conception.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Any conception requires an element; without the element, there cannot be a conception.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ created conceived the new man in Himself, indicating that He was the very element for the conceiving of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He conceived in Himself as the element the two peoples into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, He was creating the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fourth, when Christ accomplished His all-inclusive judicial redemption, He released His divine life from the shell of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 12:24 says that the Lord Jesus was a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, its outer shell cannot be broken and its life within cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ had the divine life, but it was concealed in the shell of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, He needed to suffer death on the cross that the shell of His humanity might be broken to release His divine life from His human shell.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fifth, in accomplishing His all-inclusive judicial death, Christ also laid a foundation for His organic salvation and set up the procedure to attain His ministry in the stage of His inclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ's judicial redemption is the foundation of His organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ in His full ministry in the second stage of His inclusion requires a procedure, and His judicial redemption is such a procedure to accomplish His ministry in the stage of His inclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>LEARNING TO ENTER INTO, TO SPEAK, AND TO EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning all the crucial points mentioned above, we need to learn them in a thorough and penetrating way and spend time to study them with much endeavoring.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have spoken on some of these crucial points before, and you have also heard them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, you need to learn to enter into them, to speak them, and to let all of them become your experience.</S>
