Praise the Lord that we are in the Lord's recovery where all these items are being recovered in truth and in practice.</P><P>Now we come to the church as the fourth crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery. The Greek word for church, ekklesia, means the called-out assembly. This is the basic meaning of the church. The church is composed of those who have been called out of the world by God to Himself for the fulfillment of His purpose. God needs the church to fulfill His purpose.</P><P>The church is shown in two aspects. It is the house of God and the Body of Christ. God needs a house, and Christ needs a Body. God needs a house, and this house is not a physical, material thing. He needs an organic house made of living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). The church as the house of God is His household (Eph. 2:19) because this house is composed of all His children, who are His family. We have a physical house and our family lives in that house. But God's house is His family, His household. This household is the very dwelling place of God (v. 22). God needs a dwelling place, the house of God, the church of the living God, in which He can dwell, and this is a dwelling place of God in spirit. Ephesians 2:19 says that we are members of the household of God.</P><P>We are the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15). This house of God is expressed in many localities on earth as the local churches (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11). On the one hand, it is one house; on the other hand, it is expressed in many localities so that God can carry out His purpose all over the earth.</P><P>The church is also the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). God needs a house, and Christ needs a Body. This Body is constituted with Christ as its very divine element. Christ came in incarnation as the divine Sower (Matt. 13:3, 37) to sow the divine seed into the human heart (v. 19b) so that the divine element could grow up and be mingled with the human element. He as the life seed has a certain kind of element, and we as the growing earth also have a certain kind of element, and the two mingle together and grow together to be one plant. This is the Body of Christ constituted with the divine life mingled with humanity.</P><P>The Lord Himself was the grain of wheat who fell into the ground to die so that He could be multiplied, so that He could have an increase and a multiplication for His expression (John 12:24; 1 Cor. 10:17). The house is for God's dwelling, and the Body is for Christ's expression so that Christ can be expressed on the earth.</P><P>This Body is composed of all the believers of Christ as its human members (Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:27). The divine element is Christ, but it has to be mingled with the human members, and this is what forms the Body of Christ. "So we who are many are one body in Christ" (Rom. 12:5). In 1 Corinthians 12:27 Paul says, "Now you are the body of Christ." The you here is not just the church of God which is in Corinth but the church of God which is in Corinth with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place (1:2). This shows that there is only one Body in the whole universe.</P><P>The many members in this one Body are in the organic union with Christ in His divine life. "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit" (1 Cor. 6:17). We are joined to Him, so we now need to participate in all the riches of this all-inclusive Christ for us to be constituted with Christ as the divine element so that Christ can have a counterpart for His expression on the earth today. Praise the Lord for the church as the house of God for the carrying out of His purpose and the church as the universal Body of Christ for His expression!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
