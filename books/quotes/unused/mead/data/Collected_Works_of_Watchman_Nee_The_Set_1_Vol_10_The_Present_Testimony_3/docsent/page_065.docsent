   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are many people who pray for death with Christ, but God says that in Christ we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many who pray for resurrection and ascension, but God says that in Christ we are resurrected and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many who pray to overcome the world, but the Word of God says that the victory which has overcome the world is our faith 1 John 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everything is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must see this in order to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose there is a brother or a sister here who has seen the objective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may not have seen many things, but as long as they see one verse and truly believe in it, they can walk in the path before them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people make blind requests to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have you heard of sinners asking the Lord to die for them?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once when I was preaching the gospel, I heard someone pray in this way: "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I ask that You die on my behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This prayer is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are many people who pray for the Lord to die for them or that they would die together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is utterly a joke.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mind is really useless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must believe in God's Word more than our circumstances, feelings, trials, sins, lusts, and unclean thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we can do this, we definitely will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not enough that we listen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must have the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May we see that God has accomplished everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we have to know that merely believing like this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The one thing that has to follow is obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, we must believe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, we must obey.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our self-will must be subdued, and we must present every member to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers and sisters, after we have a living faith, day by day we have to learn to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever God touches us on a certain point, and instead we want God to go along with us, we are not obeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever our will is not subdued, we are unable to believe God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A sinner who does not repent cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, a believer who willfully does not obey cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some have many things stored in their houses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some are hesitant to consecrate their children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some do not have a right attitude towards their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some do not exercise proper stewardship of their money.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you consecrated yourself to God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are you willing to go wherever God sends you?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God wants you to do the most trivial job, are you willing to do it?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, believing alone cannot keep you walking on the path ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps God wants you to obey immediately after you have believed, or He may wait a little while before He asks you to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With some people the Lord wants them to obey Him first, and then He gives them the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With other people God first gives them the faith, and then He demands obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With still others God gives them faith and at the same time demands their obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not know what the Lord requires from each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But I know that there is a great lack if we only have one of these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anyone who has not presented his body to God and thinks that believing alone is sufficient is like an unturned cake.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we see that we must obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must pass this step in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a hurdle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to be God's stewards, we must have a specific starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There must be a point at which we say to God, "From today on, I offer myself to You."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There must be a specific dealing this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There must be a time when we say to God, "From now on I offer You my time, my mind, my money, my family, and my all."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God touches everyone in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With some, God touches them on one point; with others, God touches them on another point.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many times God's demand appears to be harsh and severe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But whatever God demands of us, we must obey.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God wants us to prove that we will obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nothing is more precious to Him than Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not enough just to say verbally, "I offer Isaac as a sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must present Isaac as an offering in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do this, we will see the lamb God has prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is not satisfied until we have fully obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must experience specific dealings with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have an American friend who was once in China.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His faith is truly great.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The way the Lord led him to advance spiritually was as follows: He had a master's degree, but he continued working in the university toward a doctorate of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was a pastor and studying philosophy at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He felt something wrong with his spiritual life, and he prayed to God, "I have a great deal of unbelief on many occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I cannot overcome some sins, and I do not have the power in the work."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For two weeks he specifically prayed for God to fill him with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He wanted to acquire the victorious life and power spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God told him then, "Do you really want this?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you really do, two months from now you should not take the examination for the doctorate of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I have no use for a doctorate of philosophy."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He felt that this was rather difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>His doctorate of philosophy was something he definitely wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It would indeed be a pity if he did not go for the examination.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He knelt down to pray and bargain with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He asked why He would not let him be a doctor of philosophy and a pastor as well.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But God never bargains with man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once God has made a demand, that is the demand.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What God has said and commanded cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>During those two months, he was in considerable turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When the last Saturday came, he was in a real battle.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Should he choose the doctorate of philosophy, or should he choose the filling of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Is it better to have a doctorate of philosophy, or have a victorious life?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If others can earn a doctorate of philosophy and at the same time be used by God, why could he not do the same?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He continuously struggled and bargained with the Lord to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A doctorate of philosophy was desirable; the filling of the Holy Spirit was also desirable.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, God would not yield.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If he wanted a doctorate of philosophy, he could not live a spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If he wanted a spiritual life, he could not have his doctorate of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the end, he said in tears, "I obey.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Although I have studied philosophy for over two years, and for the past thirty some years since my childhood, I have looked forward to a doctorate in philosophy, I have to give up this pursuit for the sake of obeying God."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He wrote a letter to notify the school that he was not going to take the examination on Monday.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Thus, he forsook his doctorate of philosophy degree forever.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The next day he did not have a message on the pulpit because he was very tired from the previous night.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>So he simply related to the congregation the story of his obedience to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>On that day, three-fourths of the people in the congregation shed tears and were revived.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He himself was also very empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He said that had he foreseen this result, he would have obeyed God's leading much sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>No one used by the Lord can ever avoid this kind of crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If we wish to avoid this kind of crisis, we cannot expect to experience progress in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We must believe and also obey.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Not only do we need to obey once, but we must obey continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Otherwise, we will come short and be unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Obedience without faith is powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Faith without obedience is idealistic.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It is very painful to be obedient without faith.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Please remember the scriptural principles for our living: believing and obeying.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We cannot believe without obeying or obey without believing.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>To believe and yet not obey is false belief.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>To obey and yet not believe is asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Today in the Lord's church, men either err in faith or in obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Every failure is the result of a shortage in one of the two or in both.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>There is either faith without obedience or obedience without faith, or there is neither faith nor obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If we are willing to believe and obey, we will experience a long-lasting spring and an eternal sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The path of the righteous is like the dawning light growing brighter and brighter until the high noon.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>May God bless us and make us perfect men before Him, that is, may we be men who will believe and obey.</S>
