   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD COMING TO EARTH THROUGH MAN, AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAN BEING JOINED TO GOD THROUGH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 3 continues, So that where I am you also may be.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does where refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord was not referring to heaven but to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He would be in the Father, and we would also be in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word where does not refer to a place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It refers to being in the Lord and in God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord s going through His death and resurrection was not to be in heaven but to be in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord was resurrected, He entered into the Father, and He also brought His disciples into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the meaning of so that where I am you also may be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 4 the Lord continued, Where I am going you know the way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The disciples were not the only ones who did not know where the Lord was going.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us also do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the erroneous teaching of Catholicism says that the Lord went to heaven to prepare mansions for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This concept is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We, therefore, should not have the thought of going to a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 5 Thomas said to the Lord, We do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This verse shows that according to Thomas s understanding, the Lord was speaking of going to a place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord s reply, I am the way, shows that He was not referring to a place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord said, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me v. 6 . Because a literal translation of no one comes to the Father is not standard Chinese, the Chinese Union Bible translates the second half of this verse as: No one comes to the place where the Father is except through Me. As a result, people consider that the place where the Father is refers to heaven or a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The phrase to the Father in verse 6 refers to believing into God, into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse does not refer to our going to heaven through the Lord Jesus, but rather to our being joined to God and contacting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one can touch God or enter into God except through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus is the way, the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, it is altogether not a matter of going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the teaching of the Brethren, this chapter speaks of going to heaven; however, this chapter speaks of believing into God, not of going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is a picture of a heavenly mansion with a ladder that refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The picture also has the inscription: No one comes to the Father except through the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This implies that to go to the Father is to go to the heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This understanding is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 14:6 means that no one can enter into the Father except through Christ; no one can contact God except through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, where I am going means that through His death and resurrection, the Lord was entering into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>TO BE IN GOD BEING TO BE IN THE HEAVENLIES</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our human thought always conflicts with the thought of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our mind always considers going to a place heaven or hell but God s thought is a person, not a place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We think about heaven and earth; God thinks about God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The focus of the Bible is the Lord Jesus entering into man, not His coming to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus becoming flesh and entering into man is His coming to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Similarly, man enters into God; he does not go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Lord Jesus did not enter into man, He could not come to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order for the Lord Jesus to come to the earth, He had to enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, when the Lord Jesus entered into man, He came to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Similarly, man goes to heaven by entering into God; when man enters into God, he is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our human concept is related to a place, whereas God s concept is related to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as God can enter into man, He can come to the earth; as long as man can enter into God, man can enter into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The earth is related to man, and heaven is related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the God of heaven came to the earth without entering into man, it would not be considered His coming to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He had to enter into man for His coming to earth to be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Likewise, without entering into God, man cannot go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order for man to go to heaven, he must enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When man enters into God, he is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we can grasp this thought, we will be able to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ephesians 2:6 says, Seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can be seated together with Christ in the heavenlies because we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are not in Christ, we are on the earth, not in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, because we are in Christ, we can sit with Him in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may feel as if we are on the earth, but since we are in Him, we are in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot be in heaven by being in ourselves; rather, we are in heaven by being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need a change in our concept.</S>
