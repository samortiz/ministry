   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All the Local Churches Constituting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the One Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the local churches constitute the one Body of Christ Eph 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here the church is in the singular number, indicating that it must be the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in the Acts and the Epistles, a number of times the Bible says the churches the churches in Syria, the churches in Asia, the churches in Macedonia, and the churches in Galatia.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How could the Bible refer first to one church and then to many churches?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is because the one church, the universal church, is the totality of all the churches, and all the churches are local constituents of the one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE GENUINE GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we need to consider what the genuine ground of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ground denotes the site on which a building is built.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every building is built upon a certain piece of land, and this land is the ground on which the building is constructed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church has spread to many nations in Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In all the different nations, the church is built upon the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Ground of Locality</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One City, One Church</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The proper ground for the building of the church is the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the church spread to Korea, it first came to Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is now being built in Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the city of Seoul has become its ground.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Bible the church does not bear any particular name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this respect, the church is like the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The moon does not have a particular name; its name is simply the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not name the moon the American moon, the Chinese moon, the Korean moon, or the German moon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is only one moon, not many moons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we may speak of the moon in Seoul, the moon in Osaka, or the moon in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not denote many moons, but one moon appearing in different cities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The city is the ground on which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, taking the city as the ground, we may denote the church according to the city Rev 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, you may say that you are a member of the church in Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since my wife and I live in Anaheim, California, we are members of the church in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many of the saints attending this conference came from different cities.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We use the names of these cities to denote the different local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of this, we may say that there are many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But actually, the many local churches are simply the one universal church appearing in many cities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the one moon is seen in Seoul, it is the moon in Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When it appears in New York, it is the moon in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is only one moon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The moon in America is the moon in Korea, and the moon in Korea is the moon in China.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is only one moon, but this one moon appears in different cities.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, it is correct to speak of the moon in a certain city.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the same with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may say that there are many churches, yet the many churches are still just one church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are we all in different churches, or are we in just one church?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The proper answer is that, locally speaking, we are in many churches, but, universally speaking, we are all in one church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Are you in the local churches, or are you in the universal church?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is wise to answer, I am in the universal church by being in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not in the Roman Church, the British Church, the American Church, or the Korean Church; we are in the universal church by being in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since we are now in the city of Seoul, we should say that we are in the universal church by being in the church in Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although my wife and I reside in Anaheim, we should remember that during our stay with the saints in Seoul, we are not in the church in Anaheim, but in the church in Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now let me ask, of what church are you a member?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The best answer is that you are a member of the universal church which Jesus Christ is building, by being a member of a proper local church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While we are in Seoul, we are members of the universal church by being members of the church in Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the proper practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are members of the universal church by being members of one of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as we are members of a proper local church, we are members of the churches universally.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The ground of the church in Seoul is the city of Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, in one city there can be only one church Titus 1:5; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Acts 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, the city can never be divided; a city always remains one city.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, the ground of locality is permanently one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just as the city cannot be divided, the church ground can never be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since we do not have two cities in Seoul, we do not have two churches in Seoul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Seoul there is only one city; hence, in Seoul there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This unique ground keeps the church in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today, in a given city there may be many so-called churches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This may be likened to one city having many city halls.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a particular city has more than one city hall, this would mean that that city is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In any city there is only one city hall.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This preserves the oneness of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A local church is built on the ground of its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This unique ground may be termed the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The ground of locality is a protection which ensures that a church in a particular locality will always be preserved in oneness.</S>
