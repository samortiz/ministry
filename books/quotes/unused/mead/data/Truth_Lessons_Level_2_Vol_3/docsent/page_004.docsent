   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING OVER US, THROUGH US, AND IN US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:6 says, "One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All refers to all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Divine Trinity is implied here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Over all refers mainly to the Father, through all to the Son, and in all to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God the Father can be in three positions over all, through all, and in all because God is triune and even God the Father also is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, God the Father has all the positions of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Father, He is over all; in the Son He is through all; and as the Spirit, He is in all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that God the Father is involved with the believers in a triune way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way He is with us is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever the Father reaches us, He does not reach us alone, but He comes with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, when the Son comes with the Father, the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father comes in the Son, and the Son as the Spirit comes with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, when the Father comes, the Son and the Spirit also come.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God the Father comes to us, He always comes to us in the Son, who comes to us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit comes to us in a threefold, triune way for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we fellowship with God the Father, we can sense that He is over us, overshadowing us; at the same time, we sense that this loving One is also going through us; and as we continue to fellowship with Him, we sense, even the more, that He dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His overshadowing us, His going through us, and His dwelling in us are all for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, through His overshadowing us, going through us, and indwelling us, God dispenses Himself into us in a triune way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we experience and enjoy this dispensing, we sense God the Father in three aspects He is over us, through us, and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>SEEN BY THE PURE IN HEART</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The One who is over us, through us, and in us can be seen by us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 5:8 the Lord says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Seeing God is a reward to the pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This blessing is both for today and for the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory 1 Cor 10:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we will see God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, this does not mean that we can see God with our physical eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, we see Him with our spirit in a pure and single heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have an open spirit and a pure heart, we will see God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Seeing God is an experience and enjoyment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we see Him, He will reveal Himself in us, dispense Himself into us, and infuse Himself into our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>DRAWING NEAR TO THOSE WHO DRAW NEAR TO HIM</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God the Father not only is seen by the pure in heart but also draws near to those who draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>James 4:8 says, "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God can be seen, but we need to be pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, God desires to draw near to us, but we need to draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not draw near to Him, He will not draw near to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His drawing near to us hinges on our taking the initiative first to draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we draw near to God under the redeeming blood of Christ, we sense that God is near to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He draws near to us that we may experience and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God shows His love and sympathy toward us by drawing near to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He draws near to us, He also comforts us, encourages us, and strengthens us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God the Father is near to those who draw near to Him that He may give them His love, sympathize with them, and comfort, encourage, and strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, the believers experience and enjoy God as the Father in the love of God.</S>
