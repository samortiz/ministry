   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE SECURITY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Christianity today, people have many different views on salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some think that it is impossible to know that we are saved; others think that we can still perish after we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible, however, shows that our salvation is not only certain but also secure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we are saved, our salvation can never be shaken or changed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, once we are saved, we are eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This point is proven in the Bible in relation to at least twelve items.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>GOD S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Predestinating us unto sonship...according to...</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His will Eph 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God made us His sons and predestinated us unto sonship according to His will, not according to our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If our sonship was based on our condition, it would not be secure, because our condition constantly fluctuates.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But our sonship was predetermined according to His will; it does not depend on our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His will is not based on spur-of-the-moment decisions; rather, it is according to His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is eternal and unchanging; it does not depend on and cannot be influenced by our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, our sonship is eternally secure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose 2 Tim 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God saves us and calls us according to His purpose, not according to our works.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The salvation and calling of God are according to His will and apart from our works; they have absolutely nothing to do with our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, our salvation will not change even if our behavior changes; instead, it is eternally secure according to God s unchanging purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing John 6:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s will is that all whom He has chosen and given to the Lord, according to His unchanging purpose, would not be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since we were saved according to His choosing and belong to the Lord, we will never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are eternally secure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The unchangeableness of His counsel Heb 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s counsel cannot be changed; therefore, the salvation which God gives according to His counsel cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How could it?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our salvation is eternally secure according to God s counsel and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>GOD S CHOOSING AND CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did not choose us accidentally or on the spur of the moment; He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His choosing was not because of any special condition of ours.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our salvation is not accidental or coincidental; it is according to God s choosing in Christ before the foundation of the world, which cannot be influenced by any change on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, our salvation is eternally secure and unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You did not choose Me, but I chose you John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We did not choose the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We would not choose the Lord or even think of Him; rather, He chose us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if we had chosen the Lord, our choosing would change because we are prone to vacillate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, the Lord chose us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is eternally unchanging; therefore, His choosing is also eternally unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That the purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works but of Him who calls Rom 9:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God Himself selected us according to His purpose, not according to our works.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, our works are not related to God s choosing and absolutely cannot affect His choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s choosing is of Himself and according to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Both He and His purpose are eternally unchanging, so how can His choosing change?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How can His choosing not be eternally secure?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The gracious gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable Rom 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since God s calling is according to His unchanging person and unchanging purpose, He will not repent of it or change.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the salvation that we received according to His choosing will not change.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to God s choosing, our salvation is secure.</S>
