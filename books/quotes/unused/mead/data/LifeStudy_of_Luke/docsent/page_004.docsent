   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Mingling of the Divine Essence</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with the Human Essence</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord s two essences were not merely added together; they were mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, any conceiving is a mingling, not merely an addition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With the Man-Savior it was not the case that the divine essence was simply added to the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, in the conception of the Man-Savior the divine essence and the human essence were mingled.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some Bible students and even some Bible teachers have failed to understand the matter of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In ancient times there was a debate regarding the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence in the Person of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some who misunderstood this mingling said that it caused a third nature to be produced, something which is neither divine nor human.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To say that with respect to the Lord Jesus the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence produced a third nature, a nature that is neither fully human nor divine, is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we wish to make it clear that this is not our understanding of the word mingle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We agree with the first definition of this word given in Webster s Unabridged Dictionary: mingle to combine or join one thing with another, or two or more things together , especially so that the original elements are distinguishable in the combination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may use tea as an illustration of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When tea is mingled with water to make a beverage, neither the essence of tea nor the essence of water is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, both essences remain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These two essences mingle together to produce a beverage, but they do not produce a third nature, something which is neither tea nor water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our Savior was conceived of the divine essence and born of the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, He is a Person with two essences the divine and the human mingled together without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the Lord has two essences, He is still a single complete Person, One who is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Possessing Both the Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>with the Divine Attributes</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>and the Human Nature with the Human Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Man-Savior, the Lord Jesus possesses both the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The divine attributes are related to what God is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot speak exhaustively concerning the attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we can say that the Lord Jesus possessed the nature of God with all the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would call attention to the fact that here we are using attributes in relation to God and virtues in relation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence, He possesses the divine nature with the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because He was born of a human virgin with the human essence, He possesses the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, while He was on earth, He lived a life that was both human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was a Man living a human life, but in that human life the divine attributes were expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Gospel of John we see God expressing Himself in man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to John 1:1 and 14, in the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and this Word, which is God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God became flesh to live a life expressing Himself in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Gospel of John the emphasis is on God expressing Himself in man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in Luke the emphasis is on a Man living a life to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It seems that these two matters are very similar; yet there is a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John emphasizes God s side, and Luke emphasizes man s side.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John we see God expressing Himself in humanity; in Luke we see a Man expressing God in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As this Man lived on earth, in His living God s attributes were expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know that our Savior has both the divine essence and the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, in possessing the human essence He does not have anything related to man s fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to John 1:14, God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But from Paul s word in Romans 8:3 we see that the Lord was in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This indicates that He was born with all the human virtues created by God, but with Him there was only the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As those who are fallen, we cannot realize how sweet and how pleasant was the man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Imagine how sweet and pleasant Adam and Eve were before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They had all the human virtues created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But due to the fall, these virtues were spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the Lord Jesus was born of a human virgin with the human essence, He possessed the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the human essence of the Lord Jesus did not include man s fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His human essence was that created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He had the appearance of fallen mankind, the likeness of the flesh of sin, but His human essence, as that created by God, was pure, sweet, and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The makeup of the Man-Savior s being, His constitution, is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How marvelous that there could be One in this universe with such a composition!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Man-Savior man and God, God and man, are mingled to form a composition full of the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to have this view of the Man-Savior as we read the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the early years I did not have such a view of the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But eventually the Lord opened my eyes and I began to see that in Luke s narration we have One who is a composition of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This understanding has been confirmed by the writings of others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Gospel of Luke we see the God-man, a Person who is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this Person we see all the attributes of God and all the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Divine Attributes Strengthening</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>and Enriching the Human Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we read the Gospel of Luke carefully, we shall see that the divine attributes strengthen and enrich the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, the Bible clearly reveals that God is love 1 John 4:8 and that God loves John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible also says that as those created by God, we should love others Rom 13:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God loves, and we also should love.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, we may love without having God s love to strengthen and enrich our love.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Confucius said that we should love others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But he did not point out that human love can be strengthened and enriched by the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In Luke we see a Man, the Man-Savior, who was very loving.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Yet in His love there is the divine love strengthening and enriching the human love.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord s living was the living of a Person who was a wonderful composition of divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As such a Person, the Lord was constituted of the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have indicated that in the Gospel of Luke there are a number of gospel messages, gospel parables and gospel cases.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we get into the depths of Luke s narration, we shall see that these three categories of things reveal that the living of the Lord Jesus on earth was fully strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As a result, He lived in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the following message we shall consider in more detail the meaning of the highest standard of morality portrayed in the Gospel of Luke.</S>
