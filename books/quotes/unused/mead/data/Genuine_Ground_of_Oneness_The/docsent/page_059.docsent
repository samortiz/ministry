   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE VESSELS AND THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Lord stirred up the spirits of the people to return to Jerusalem, not only was there a recovery of the ground of oneness; there was also a spontaneous recovery of all the positive things that had been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The vessels that Nebuchadnezzar "had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put..in the house of his gods" were brought back to Jerusalem Ezra 1:7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moreover, once the remnant of the people had returned, "they set the altar in its place" Ezra 3:3, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's people knew that the place for the altar was not in Babylon, but only in the unique place of God's choice in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The altar could not even be put in any place in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It had to be set up on the very place Abraham offered Isaac to God on Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anyone who wanted to present an offering to God had to go to that definite, specific, and unique place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today this unique place is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever Christians lose the oneness, they automatically lose the place to set up the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, they have no way to present a proper offering to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before coming into the church life, many of us tried to offer ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I can testify that a number of times I consecrated myself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But from our experience both before and after we came into the church life, we can testify that such a consecration was not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without returning to the unique ground of oneness, there is no way to offer anything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Soon after God's people had returned to Jerusalem, they set up the altar and began offering sacrifice again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was the same in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we came into the church life, we found ourselves able to consecrate ourselves to the Lord in a proper and genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE PROPER FUNCTION OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, it was after they returned from captivity that God's people dealt with their mixed marriages with the heathen Ezra 9:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their conscience could no longer tolerate such an ungodly practice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was a spontaneous result of returning to the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Surely there were many mixed marriages among the people in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, their conscience caused them to deal with these marriages only after they returned from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same is true in the Lord's recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After we came into the church life, our conscience began to function in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We "girded up our loins" and became careful regarding matters about which we had previously been rather loose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before we came to the Lord's recovery, we might have been free to engage in certain worldly amusements.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after we came into the church life, our whole being was girded up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We began to pursue godliness, and we had an increased desire to pray and to read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Spontaneously we exercised our conscience more thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This behavior was not the result of teaching or regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was the automatic issue of returning to the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Simply because we had come into the church life, we had a desire for godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many negative things began to drop off, and many positive things became our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, we had the sense within that we should no longer practice Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one charged us to discontinue the celebration of Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We simply began to have the sense that we should no longer celebrate it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In like manner, we began to discard many other negative things and to enjoy positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This illustrates the fact that when the oneness is recovered, all the positive things are recovered along with it.</S>
