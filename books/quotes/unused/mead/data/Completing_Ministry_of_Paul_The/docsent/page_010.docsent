   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE CHURCH 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:2-11; 1:22-23; 4:10, 13; 2:15; 4:24; Col 3:10-11; Eph 5:23-27, 29-32; 2:10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Without the ministry of the Apostle Paul we would lack a clear vision not only of Christ but also of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the four Gospels the church is mentioned only twice, both times in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter sixteen the Lord says that He will build His church and that the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it v. 18 . In chapter eighteen He mentions the local church v. 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Acts describes the beginnings of the church and how churches were established here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As for a definition of the church, it is hard to come up with one based upon what we are told in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our understanding of what the church is would be quite hazy if we had only the book of Acts to draw on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek word for church, ecclesia, means a called-out assembly or congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In olden times when the Greeks in a city gathered together to discuss the affairs of state, that body of citizens was called an ecclesia.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has called out His chosen people and gathered them together: this is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just by understanding the meaning of the word, however, we do not know much about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul s writings are where we find the church presented in the clearest, most thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this message we shall cover six ways in which Paul describes the church; then in the next message we shall go over another six.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All twelve are profound and rich in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I. THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Ephesians 3:4 the church is called the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We saw in our previous message that Christ is the mystery of God Col 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No human mentality can understand God, yet Christ fully defines Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is also His embodiment and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may say that Christ is the story of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The story of God is the same as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as Christ is the mystery of God, so the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ Himself is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through all these twenty centuries no one has come on the scene who can compare with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His name has spread throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely He must be powerful and wise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet who can understand Him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these years very few have realized who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul was among these few.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nonetheless, this mystery has a definition, and this definition is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is the story of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is His embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To see Christ we must come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whoever wants to see God must contact Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whoever would see Christ must come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even as we meet here for this training, we are the mystery of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Apparently we are a gathering of people from many different countries.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have here Germans, French, Italians, Spaniards, Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, Dutch, British, Americans, and Orientals.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In actuality, however, we are not gathered here as an assortment of different nationalities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are all part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not like the United Nations!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are here as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our nationality is buried.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we are is buried.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All that is left in the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As Ephesians 3:2-11 makes clear, the mystery of Christ implies His unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All these riches are found in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church is not the place for American philosophy, Chinese ethics, or German scientific research.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is room only for Christ and His unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, through the church the multifarious wisdom of God is being made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All this is according to God s eternal purpose, which He purposed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we are touching here is profoundly great.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is outside the realm of philosophy, religion, or science.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This mystery is nothing less than Christ with all His unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope you will go over these verses and pray-read them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You need to realize what they say not by your mental ability but by revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This revelation comes to your spirit, not to your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you exercise your spirit and pray over these verses, you will see this mystery: the mystery of Christ, which is the church, containing His unsearchable riches and making known God s wisdom according to His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church is also His Body Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only in Paul s writings do we find the church described as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This term is not found in the Gospels nor in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The human body is a marvel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Medical students spend years learning how it is put together.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After such a comprehensive study, they surely must admit that some mighty Being is behind this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There can be no other reasonable explanation for all its intricacies.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The church is even more wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ has a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some Bible teachers think that the Body of Christ is a metaphor, a figure of speech, to help us understand what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I used to teach that myself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The more I studied the Bible, however, the more I realized that the Body of Christ is not a mere figure of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is a fact and a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A body is a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is not like this stand, which was made of pieces of wood put together in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A body is not made by attaching bones together; that result would be a lifeless skeleton.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Every part of the human body is organic; it has life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our teeth are organic; only false teeth have no life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our ears are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I knew a brother who had a false ear; he could take it off.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>His own ear had been removed because of cancer.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>That prosthetic ear was not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>My glasses are not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They are replacing the lenses that were removed from my eyes when I had surgery for cataracts.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Those original lenses in my eyes were organic; these that I wear now have no life whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There is deep significance in the church as the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In Christianity today there are many false teeth, false limbs, and mechanical motions!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The impression is that of a robot, made of wood or steel.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When a living person stands, or raises his arm, or bends, all his actions stem from life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He is not a mechanical device put together to seem human.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He is living!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>So is the church!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is Christ s Body to express Him in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There is no need to perform.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This organism is the way it is because of life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The way the brothers and sisters are should be the result of life, not of a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Body of Christ is His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Notice from these verses Eph 1:22-23 that Christ has been made Head over all things to the church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The church is one with Christ, sharing and enjoying His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He has been made Head over all, and as His Body we are one with Him, enjoying His headship.</S>
