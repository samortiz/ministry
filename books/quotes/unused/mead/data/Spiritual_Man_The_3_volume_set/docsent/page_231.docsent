   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Since the purpose of God is such, God allows a believer to pass through many fiery trials under His sovereign arrangement so that all desire, like dross, will be fully burned by the fire of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A believer longs for high position, but the Lord will not allow him to be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has many hopes, yet the Lord will not allow him to be successful in anything; rather, He causes all his hopes to be crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believer may have many delights, but the Lord will cause him to lose all of his delights and have no way to gain them back.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The believer covets glory, but the Lord causes him to suffer shame.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Almost nothing in the Lord's arrangements agrees with the thoughts of the believer; everything is like a beating rod.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Though the believer still struggles with great effort, he will soon see the Lord yet not know that it is the Lord leading him to meet death face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is as if everything were dead; everything wants him to die, and everything wants him to lose the hope of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that moment, he realizes that he cannot escape death and that he owes this death to God; hence, he submits himself to God and dies willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This death causes him to lose his soul-life in order that he may fully live in God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is for this death that God has done much work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A believer may resist for a long time, but once he passes through death, everything is fine, and God accomplishes His purpose in him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From then on, the believer can advance quickly on his spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once the believer has lost his heart for self, he can fully submit himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is willing to become whatever God desires of him; his desire is no longer contrary to God, and he no longer seeks anything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His living is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He expects nothing, he demands nothing, and he covets nothing; he just willingly submits to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A life that submits to God's will is the simplest life on earth because this life does not seek anything for the self but rather silently follows God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a believer is willing to forsake all his own desires, he gains a life of real rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the past he had many desires, exhausting all of his wits, strength, schemes, devices, and methods to gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, his heart was often confused.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he pursued his desires, he was anxious and troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When he failed, he was worried and irritable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can he have rest?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Believers who have not forsaken their own desires and completely submitted to God feel sad about changing human relationships, the unpredictable condition of their environments, the adversities in their life, their loneliness, and many other outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This kind of sorrowful feeling is commonly found in believers who are strong in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Desire can also arouse wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the believer becomes vexed, anxious, and angry because many outward things are not agreeable or in accordance with his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To him they are unfair and unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These different expressions of the emotion are caused by people's treatment of him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Pleasant feelings can easily be disturbed, provoked, and hurt by others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The natural desire of a believer yearns for man's love, respect, sympathy, and intimacy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he cannot obtain these, he murmurs and complains.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But who can avoid sorrowful things?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is there anyone living in this bitter world who can fully realize his desires?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, an emotional believer does not have a life of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only when a believer completely walks by the spirit, not seeking the pleasure of his desire and being content with what God has granted, can he have rest.</S>
