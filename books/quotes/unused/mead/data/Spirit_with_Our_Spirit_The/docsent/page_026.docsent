   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have seen that in the Old Testament, the Spirit is revealed simply as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But when we come to the New Testament, the revelation concerning the Spirit is very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the New Testament revelation, the Spirit has passed through a number of stages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of course, He was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Spirit of holiness throughout the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Throughout these four thousand years of human history, the Spirit of God never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But to say that God the Spirit has never changed is a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because after four thousand years of human history, the Triune God Himself entered into a period of time in which He passed through many processes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These processes were incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now He is working in His heavenly ministry, which will be concluded at His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 1 says that He will come the second time, not as the only begotten Son of God but as the Firstborn vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the only begotten Son of God, He possesses merely divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But He will come the second time not mainly in His divine status but in His human status.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before His incarnation Christ, the divine One, already was the only begotten Son of God John 1:18; Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By incarnation He put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then He went through death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In resurrection His humanity was "sonized," was made divine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Resurrection was a birth to Christ Acts 13:33 , and in that birth Christ in His humanity was born to be the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29; 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In resurrection He brought His humanity into the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now as the firstborn Son of God, He possesses humanity as well as divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, as the Firstborn He brought forth many sons in the same birth and on the same day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the day of His resurrection, not only He but also all God's chosen people were begotten 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since He was the Firstborn, surely there were many others to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Millions of others were born with Him on the same day, the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was the Firstborn, and we are the many-born sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His resurrection He was also made the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That was the consummation of God's processes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the Triune God has gone through so many processes, how could the Spirit of God have remained the same, without any change?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the Spirit of God has undergone a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit changed into the Holy Spirit for the bringing forth of Christ into humanity, for His conception Matt 1:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that point the Spirit of God entered into a new age with a new title the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, the literal translation of the Holy Spirit is "the Spirit the Holy."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means the Spirit is the Holy One.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only God is "the Holy."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the New Testament age, the first thing God did was to enter into man for the purpose of making man God, not in the Godhead, but in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He became God in man that man might become God so that man might be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now not only God is holy; the man made by God can also be holy Eph 1:4; 1 Pet 1:15-16 .</S>
