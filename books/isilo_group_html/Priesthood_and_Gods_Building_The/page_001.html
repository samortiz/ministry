<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is compiled from messages given by Witness Lee in 1961 in Taipei, Taiwan. In January Brother Lee spoke ten messages in a conference related to the building up of the church. These messages have been published in the book entitled <em>The Vision of the Building of the Church.</em> During this same period of time, he also had extensive fellowship with the co-workers. This fellowship has been published in the book entitled <em>The Blueprint and the Ground for the Building Up of the Church.</em> After his conference and fellowship with the co-workers, the church in Taipei actively devoted itself to matters related to the exercise and the practice of the building up of the church. The twenty-four messages in this book are a record of Brother Lee&rsquo;s further leading in the church in Taipei in this regard. Messages 1 through 14 were originally published in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from February to August of 1961. Messages 15 through 24 were given in meetings for responsible ones in districts and small groups from March to September. These messages, which are being published for the first time, have been edited from audio recordings of these meetings.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | First | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 1</div><br></body></html>
