There were two churches completely in failure, having no praise at all from the Lord, namely Sardis and Laodicea. There were other churches that had many good works as well as many evil deeds. We observe that at the beginning the Lord always commended their virtues, and at the end He always had to reprimand them! Turning from praise to rebuke, the Lord often used the word "but." How unfortunate this is! "Although...but..."-such flaws amidst excellence! In 2:2-3 the Lord mentioned many virtues about the church in Ephesus, but in verse four He says, "But I have one thing against you...." In 2:13 the Lord commended the faithfulness of the church in Pergamos, but verse 14 says, "But I have a few things against you..." In 2:19 the Lord revealed the good works of the church in Thyatira, but verse 20 says, "But I have something against you..." All praises for us cannot conceal our slightest mistakes. It is indeed a pity that in all of our goodness we unavoidably find a "but"! May the Lord keep us perfect in Him, and may our "ointment" contain not one single "dead fly."</P><P>At whichever point the church of the Lord fell, there the Lord commanded them to repent (2:5, 16; 3:3, 19). The church still needs to repent! Saints still need to repent! We think that repentance is the means for sinners to believe in the gospel and that it is not necessary for us, the believers, to repent. However, repentance of the saints is spoken of by the Lord Himself. We wish that the Lord could use nicer and prettier words to regulate us, but the Lord says "repent." It is easy for the saints to talk about consecration, work, zeal, faith, and love, but the Lord Jesus says these are not enough; we ought to "repent." How humbling and humiliating this word is! Once a person has sinned, whether he be a sinner or a saint, he must repent. One may have many good deeds and virtues, but if he has not repented of the evils the Lord rebuked, he will receive the Lord's chastisement. Even though this is not eternal perdition, it is still quite a severe punishment. A saint ought not to consider his own good deeds so much. Instead he ought to repent of his own failures so that he can reach a state of perfection.</P><P>We ought to repent. This is the Lord's command and exhortation. If we do not obey His will, we will surely come under the judgment. "But if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent" (2:5). "Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth" (2:16). "If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief" (3:3). The Lord calls us to repentance because we have flaws. If we repent, we will receive the help, but if we do not repent, He will execute judgment. Therefore, backslidden Christians ought to rise up in haste! In these seven epistles the Lord is promising special spiritual blessings to the seven churches. If they want them, they can all receive them. Ephesus can return to the first love, Smyrna can receive the martyr's crown, Pergamos can recover the pure truth, Thyatira can remove Jezebel, Sardis can renew its vigil for the Lord's return, Philadelphia can enter the wide open door, and Laodicea can fill all her lack. The Lord has grace. Who is willing to receive it?</P><P>(6)Concerning the promise of the Lord to the individual overcomers, the Lord has warned, exhorted, called, rebuked, and commanded the church in general. However, who will listen to His voice? Although the Lord desires that the entire church would obey, He fully realizes that only certain individuals will overcome and will obey. There is no such thing as the whole group turning and repenting. For this reason, He promises great rewards to those overcoming individuals. Please see 2:7, 10, 11, 17, 26-28 and 3:5, 12, and 21.</P><P>After reading these seven epistles, one will realize the confusion in the churches at that time, but are the churches at the present time not in the same condition? I am afraid that the corruption of the churches today is much worse than that in those days. Therefore, now is the time for us to overcome. If we overcome, we shall receive the wonderful glory of the Lord's promise, but if we are unfaithful, we shall also face very severe consequences. May we, who have received abundant grace from the Lord, not be complacent about our salvation. May we care for our Father's desire daily. May we be separated from others in all sinful situations, whether they be in the world or in the church, and may we overcome as our Lord has overcome so that we may please God and obtain His reward.</P><P>These promises are special rewards from God. We cannot receive them if we do not overcome. The condition to gain these rewards is to overcome. We should not confuse overcoming with salvation. Salvation is through our believing in the redemption accomplished on the cross by our Lord Jesus. After salvation, overcoming is through drawing upon the Lord's grace daily and allowing His cross and the Holy Spirit to work in our lives with the result that we overcome sin, the world, the flesh, and Satan. A person who is saved but has not overcome can never obtain these special rewards and glory from the Lord. Every saint can be in danger of losing God's promise! How severe is God's word to Sardis and Laodicea! Even with Philadelphia the Lord still asks that she keep what she has! We ought to be careful or else we will lose our blessing. May the glory of the next age attract our hearts so that we may be willing to forego the pleasures of this life and to endure the scorns of this world.</P><P>These promises match the particular condition of every church. For example, the Lord promises Smyrna, the one being faithful unto death, that she will not be hurt by the second death. See how kind our Lord is! Not only does He give us the power to make us faithful, He also promises us the reward to motivate us to overcome. To Laodicea, the church which is most unlikely to overcome, the greatest promise is given in order that they might aspire to the coming glory. May we live today for the coming glory!</P><P>(7)In every epistle we find the Lord's calling, so that those who have an ear may hear what the Spirit says to the churches. All who have an ear must hear, and all who can hear must not disregard it. The Holy Spirit of God is calling us to be faithful servants to obtain the glory. Therefore we ought to listen. Otherwise, we will miss the opportunity for the reward. All those who are willing to listen should not only hear what the Spirit says to their own church but should also hear what the Spirit says to all the churches. We who have an ear must listen to all the speaking of the Spirit. To miss even one sentence is a loss to our spiritual welfare. Do you have an ear?</P><P>The above seven points are common to all the seven epistles. Once we understand the general overview, then we can study their contents in a more detailed way.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 04: The Christian (2) &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
