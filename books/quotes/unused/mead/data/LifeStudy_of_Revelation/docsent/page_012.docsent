   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE THREE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PARTICULAR AND CONSUMMATE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Revelation firstly reveals Christ, and secondly the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, this book is concerned with Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Revelation, Christ and the church are revealed in a unique and particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the last message we pointed out that many aspects of Christ which are not found in other books in the Bible are unveiled in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The same is true with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The book of Revelation unfolds the church in a very particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we shall present a summary of the aspects of the church found in Revelation, while in later messages we shall cover the details.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. THE LAMPSTANDS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Firstly, in Revelation the churches are unveiled as being the lampstands 1:11-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In no other New Testament book is this term used with respect to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other books we are told that the church is the gathering of God s chosen ones, that it is the Body of Christ, and that it is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But apart from Revelation, we are not told that the church is the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the lampstands, the churches shine in the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word lampstand enables us to understand much about the church and its function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is not the lamp; it is the lampstand, the stand which holds the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the lamp, the lampstand is vain and means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the lampstand holds the shining lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we saw in the preceding message, God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, Christ is the lamp, and the church is the lampstand holding the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is in Christ and Christ as the lamp is held by the stand to shine out God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. Golden Divine in Nature</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the local churches, the lampstands are golden in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In typology, gold signifies divinity, the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the local churches are divine in nature; they are constituted with the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To say this is absolutely scriptural, for the book of Revelation says that the local churches are golden lampstands 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These stands are not built of clay, wood, or any inferior substance; they are constructed out of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that all the local churches must be divine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without divinity, there can be no church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the church is composed of humanity with divinity, humanity should not be the basic nature of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The basic nature of the local churches must be divinity, God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By these two simple words golden lampstands we realize a great deal about the church: that the church is something shining with Christ and that it is constituted with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. Shining in Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The lampstands shine in the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there were no darkness, there would be no need for the shining of the light of the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The shining of the lamp is quite particular.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order for the lamp to shine, it must have oil burning within it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the oil burns within the lamp, the light will shine out through all the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the function of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The function of the church is not simply to preach or to teach doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the dark night of this age, the church must shine out the very glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>C. Identical with One Another</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the lampstands are identical with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many Christians, having taken in a mistaken concept, desire to be different from other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I came to this country fourteen years ago, I met some dear Christians who were troubled because the local churches were all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They told me that they would try their best to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everyone has a head, two shoulders, two arms, two hands, and ten fingers, and every human head has seven holes: two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, and a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is ridiculous to say, I don t want to have the same appearance as others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to be different, I would like to have five holes in my head.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How ridiculous this is!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who claim that every local church should be unique base their concept upon the differences among the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some have said, Look!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the seven churches are different.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the early years, when I was very young, I was influenced by this concept and I taught the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But one day the light dawned upon me and I saw that all the differences in the local churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are negative, not positive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Ephesus lost her first love negative; Pergamos is worldly negative; Thyatira is demonic negative; and Laodicea became lukewarm negative.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the positive side, however, all the local churches are identical, because they all are seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you could place all the seven lampstands on a table before you, unless you numbered or labeled them, you would be unable to tell them apart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the seven lampstands are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nevertheless, since 1962, some voices in this country have declared loudly that they will never be like the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Where are those voices today?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They have faded away, and all the peculiar concepts they advocated have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am not saying that all must follow the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if Los Angeles has seven holes, then it would be ridiculous for others to insist upon having five holes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the positive side, all the local churches must be identical.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the negative side, however, they are different.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the church in Los Angeles would worship idols, then we must refuse to follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In matters such as this, we must be different.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But it is wrong to say that, on the positive side, the local churches should not be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not try to make ourselves peculiar or different this is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>One day the Lord showed me that the four sides of the New Jerusalem are exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Each side of the wall is built with the same material jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not that one side is built with jasper and the other sides with brass.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No, all four sides are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Likewise, universally, all the churches must be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They need not be the same in organization, but they must be identical in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For example, the churches in New Zealand should be the same as the churches in Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Because we all are one church, all the churches on earth should be universally the same.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Locally, we are the churches; universally, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
