   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE TERMINATION OF THE OLD THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that Mark opens with a word concerning the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1:4-8 John the Baptist preached the baptism of repentance and also introduced the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in 1:9 we are told that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the Lord Jesus was baptized, He was anointed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then He began His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have pointed out, with the Lord Jesus life, work, and ministry were all one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With Him there was no distinction between life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have seen, the word beginning in 1:1 implies a new start, and this new start involves the termination of the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In previous messages we have listed ten items of these old things: culture, religion, ethics, morality, improvement of character, human philosophy, and trying to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All these things were in existence when John the Baptist came forth to preach the baptism of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Mark 1 these things were terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By what were the old things terminated?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were terminated by the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, these old things were buried when the Lord Jesus was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea, Pharaoh and the armies of Egypt were buried.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may say that the children of Israel brought Pharaoh and his armies with them into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a similar way, when the Lord Jesus stepped into the waters of baptism, He brought with Him all ten items of the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, these old things were terminated and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>LIVING IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The life the Lord Jesus lived was not a life according to culture or religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was not even according to ethics, morality, philosophy, or improvement of character.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus did not live a life of trying to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead of living according to these ten items, He lived a life that was fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to be deeply impressed with the matter of a life fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are impressed with this thought and expression as we read the Gospel of Mark, we shall be enlightened through what is recorded in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus, as portrayed in the Gospel of Mark, was different from any other man who had ever lived.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Old Testament we see the living of those who came before the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of those who lived before the time of Christ were men of culture, religion, ethics, and morality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some cared for philosophy, and others were for the improvement of character.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some sought to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in Mark we see a Man who is in an altogether different category.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This One the Lord Jesus lives in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, He Himself is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AS THE SEED OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1:1 and 14 we read of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This gospel is also the gospel of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not many Christians have realized that the kingdom of God is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The kingdom eventually becomes a corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The seed of the kingdom is an individual, the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Sower, He came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now this seed is developing into the corporate kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kingdom is actually the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The development of the Lord as the seed of the kingdom is His Body, and His Body is His increase, His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This understanding of the kingdom of God is certainly different from the traditional concept of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the New Testament, the kingdom of God is the enlargement of the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The kingdom is the development of the seed, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today this development of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the church as Christ s Body is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the One who is the seed of the kingdom of God, the Lord Jesus lived a life that is altogether different from a life of culture, religion, ethics, morality, improvement of character, philosophy, and the effort to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The life He lived was according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we have seen, God s economy is a matter of the dispensing of Himself the Triune God into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only the kind of life lived by the Lord Jesus is a life in which the Triune God is dispensed into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A living that is according to culture, religion, ethics, and morality is not the living that dispenses God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No matter how cultured, religious, ethical, or moral you may be, in that kind of living there will be no dispensing of the Triune God into others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Confucius, for example, taught ethics, and he behaved in a moral, ethical way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nevertheless, in his living there was not the dispensing of the Triune God into people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The same is true with respect to those who lived a life of philosophy or improvement of character, and even of those who tried to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Praise the Lord that in His life there was the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>THE SEED OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>AS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have emphasized the fact that the gospel, which is a new beginning, terminates all the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the Lord Jesus was baptized, the old things were buried.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In His living after His baptism, a living that was according to the New Testament economy of God, the Lord Jesus sowed Himself as the seed of life into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The seed sown by the Lord Jesus, a seed that was actually the Lord Jesus Himself, is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means that the Lord Jesus is nothing less than the very embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is proved in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Word in the beginning, the Word which was God, became flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This indicates that Jesus is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Through incarnation He became the seed of life, and in His ministry He sowed this seed into others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This means that into His followers He sowed Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we see that such a seed was sown into the Lord s disciples, we shall have a proper basis for understanding the Gospel of Mark as a portrait of the life that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
