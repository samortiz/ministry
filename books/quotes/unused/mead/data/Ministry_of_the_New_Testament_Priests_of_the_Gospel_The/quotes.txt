[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE INITIAL STEP IN FULFILLING THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Matt 3:1-6; 1 Tim 1:16; 1 Pet 2:9; Rom 15:16; 12:1; Col 1:28-29; 1 Pet 2:5; Luke 10:1-6; John 15:16 OUTLINE The turn from the Old Testament priestly service to the New Testament priestly service: Beginning with John the Baptist: Although he can be considered the last priest of the Old Testament, he rejected that service and turned to another service Matt 3:1-4.
[2]  He turned to become the first priest of the gospel in the New Testament: Not offering bulls and goats as sacrifices.
[3]  With the gospel-preaching apostles as a pattern 1 Tim 1:16: Preaching the gospel extensively to save people and offer them to God as sacrifices 1 Pet 2:9; Rom 15:16.
[4]  In the five messages of this book we will particularly cover a unique matter in the New Testament, that is, the New Testament priests of the gospel of God.
[5]  With the Gospel-preaching Apostles as a Pattern Preaching the Complete Gospel
[6]  THE INITIAL STEP FOR THE BELIEVERS TO MINISTER AS THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL
[7]  As saved believers, we are all priests of the gospel.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO NOURISHING AND CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: John 21:15; 15:16; 1 Thes 2:7; Rom 9:5; 1 Tim 2:5; Luke 2:11; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 4:24; Rom 10:12; 1 Pet 2:2; Rom 12:1; Acts 5:42 OUTLINE Feeding the Lord's lambs John 21:15: That our fruit may remain John 15:16.
[9]  In the preceding message we have seen that in the New Testament God desires that every saved one should be not only a priest but a priest of the gospel.
[10]  The Qualifications for Being a Priest of the Gospel of God
[11]  Feeding the Lord's lambs is also a part of the work of the priests of the gospel of God.
[12]  We must: 1 have the image of God to express Him; 2 have the authority of God to represent Him; 3 have God's life to live Him out; 4 be those who have fellowship with God and who draw near to God; 5 be those who are one spirit with God and who are joined to Him to be one with Him; 6 be the prophets of God who speak for God; 7 be able to bring God to man and bring man to God; 8 experience the complete salvation of Christ and enjoy all the riches of Christ; 9 be able to dispense Christ to others; and 10 be able to present others those who are being nourished by us and who are under our care full-grown in Christ to God.
[13]  Leading the New Believers to Know the Lord, to Contact the Lord with Their Spirit, and to Grow
[14]  In taking care of the new believers by nourishing them, first we need to lead them to know who the Lord is.
[15]  CHAPTER THREE TEACHING AND PERFECTING THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; 1 Thes 2:11; Acts 20:20, 27, 31; Col 1:28-29; Eph 4:11-12 OUTLINE Meeting with the saints in small group meetings that are full of mutuality Heb 10:24-25: Leading and cultivating the saints: To open up and fellowship with one another.
[16]  We need not only to nourish and take care of the new believers but also to teach and perfect them.
[17]  As the New Testament priests of the gospel, we need to work on sinners that we may help them to be saved and bring them back to God through the gospel.
[18]  HAVING SMALL GROUP MEETINGS THAT ARE FULL OF MUTUALITY
[19]  The primary emphasis of the small group meetings is to lead and cultivate the saints that they may open up and fellowship with one another.
[20]  CHAPTER FOUR PROPHESYING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:3-5, 12, 1, 31, 24, 26 OUTLINE Being the consummation of the ministry of the New Testament priests of the gospel: Prophesying being to speak for the Lord for the building up of the church 1 Cor 14:3-5.
[21]  In the previous messages we have seen the first three crucial steps of the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel.
[22]  CHAPTER FIVE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Prov 4:18; 2 Cor 4:16; Gal 5:25; Rom 8:4; Phil 2:14; Gal 5:26; 1 Cor 1:10; Eph 4:14; 1 Tim 1:3-4; Matt 26:41; Rom 12:11; Col 1:29; 1 Cor 15:58; Phil 3:20; 2 Cor 5:10 OUTLINE Being revived every morning Prov 4:18.
[23]  PERFECTING THE SAINTS UNTIL THEY ALL CAN DO THE WORK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY
[24]  Ephesians 4 shows us that in His ascension Christ as the ascended Head has given gifts to the church, His Body, for the perfecting of the saints.
[25]  THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL
[26]  For such a glorious goal and result, there are requirements for the ministry of the New Testament priests of the gospel.
