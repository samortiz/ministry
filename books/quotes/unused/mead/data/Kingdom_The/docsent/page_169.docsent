   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the fourth section there are four circles which represent various aspects of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The innermost circle represents the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believers in this circle are like those mentioned in Matthew 5, 6, and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are poor in spirit, pure in heart, hungering for righteousness, meek, merciful, and have the surpassing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are not only believers, but overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, they represent the reality of the kingdom today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are in the reality of the kingdom, and they are the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Surrounding this innermost circle is a second circle that represents the church which is composed of all real Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that not all of the real Christians are in the reality of the kingdom, but they are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because they have been bought by the blood of the Lamb and because they have been reborn of the Holy Spirit, they are real Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, they are a part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But whether, after they are reborn, they will be overcomers is something pending.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church there are two categories of real Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One category is those who are reborn but who are not overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A higher category is the overcoming Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The overcoming Christians represent the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The overcoming Christians plus all the real, but defeated Christians, compose the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Outside the second circle there is a third circle which represents the appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some today are Christians in name only.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are the so-called nominal Christians; they are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are in Christendom, but they are not in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have never been redeemed by the blood, and they have never been reborn of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are Christians only in name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means they are tares, not wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Outside of the third circle, there is the fourth circle which represents the world or the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to this chart there is the reality of the kingdom, the church, and the appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The appearance of the kingdom is today's Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is very little difference and separation between Christendom and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we may say that there are basically three kinds of Christians: first are the victorious, overcoming Christians who are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and also in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second are the true believers who are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are in the church because they are real believers, but they are not in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third group are those who are Christians in name only.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christendom is full of such nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These are not actually in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, outside of Christendom there is the world with all the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The biggest group of people on the earth today are the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps the second biggest group are the false Christians of Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The next largest group are the real Christians who are the church, and the smallest group are the overcoming ones within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These three groups of people are included within the age or dispensation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Following this section there is the second section of the kingdom of the heavens, the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the dispensation of the church, the Lord will come back, and the kingdom of the heavens will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This aspect will be in the future and will include the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the New Testament, the millennium is clearly revealed to be of two parts: the upper part, the heavenly part, and the lower part, the earthly part.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The upper part is the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the heavenly part where the Lord Jesus and all of the overcoming saints will be reigning as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The lower part is composed of the revived nation of Israel in the center teaching the nations how to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Matthew 5, 6, and 7 show us the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They reveal the internal or interior reality found in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first aspect of the people who are living in the reality of the kingdom is that they are poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens" Matt 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is something real.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please note that the verb here is not in the future tense.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It does not say theirs shall be the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, it says theirs is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means the reality of the kingdom is something real and present today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not merely something in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Another verse says, "Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens" Matt 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here are some who are persecuted for being right, for the sake of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And they themselves are hungering and thirsting after righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are even willing to pay a price and to suffer for the sake of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This indicates how real it is to them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Again, this also is something for today, not merely something for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Surely this is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then Matthew 7:21 says, "Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father Who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This too is something of the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Another verse, Matthew 18:3, says, "Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become as little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These four verses refer to the first aspect, the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They indicate something so real, pure, and genuine.</S>
