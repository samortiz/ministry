<P>At the beginning of this chapter in the Scripture reading, we have listed three portions from the divine Word: Genesis 1, Psalm 8, and Hebrews 2. Genesis 1 says that God made the decision to have man in His own image and to have man entrusted with His authority. But we know that after Genesis 1, man became fallen and lost such a position. After the fall of man, however, there is Psalm 8. The psalmist said, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,/What is man, that You remember him,/And the son of man, that You visit him?" (vv. 3-4; cf. Heb. 2:6). Notice that the psalmist did not say, "What are the angels?" Instead, he said, "What is man?" While the psalmist was considering and looking at the heavens, he saw the moon and the stars. Seemingly he should have had an appreciation for the angels. But instead of appreciating the angels, he said, "What is man?" He looked at the heavens, the moon, and the stars, but he did not appreciate anything in the heavens. Rather, he appreciated man on this earth and wondered what man is.</P><P>Today the scientists are greatly concerned with the moon and the stars. The United States spent much money and effort to send a man to the moon. Even the psalmist was considering the moon and the stars, yet the Spirit turned him to man on this earth. We should not focus our attention on the heavens with the moon and the stars. Instead, we should focus our attention on the earth with man as the center. "O Jehovah our Lord,/How excellent is Your name/In all the earth" (Psa. 8:1). Note that the psalmist did not say that Jehovah's name is excellent "in all the heavens," but "in all the earth."</P><P>My burden is to help the young people realize the preciousness of man in the eyes of God, not only at the time of man's creation but also after his fall. Everything on this earth is a mess. Due to the fall, the earth has become a tragedy. This is why man is always looking to the heavens. If the young people could fly away from this earth, surely they would do it. But God did not give us the capacity to fly away. He wants us to stay on this earth. This may not be our choice, but this surely is our destiny. We have to be on this earth. Even after the fall, God's interest is still on this earth. When we look at the heavens, the moon, and the stars, God would turn our spirit to look at man on this earth. We have to say from our spirit, "What is man?"</P><P>In order to see what man is, we need the entire sixty-six books of the Bible. Man is wonderful and meaningful. The Bible is a divine book which reveals to us not only God but also man. Do you know who you are? If you want to know who you are, you need to know the Bible. You have to say, "I am God's expression and God's representative. I am a person created in the image of God and entrusted with the divine authority." We all have to know this. This should not merely be a saying, a doctrine, or a teaching. This must be our practice. Day by day we should behave ourselves as those who always bear the image of God as God's expression and who have been committed with the divine authority as God's representative. This is God's purpose for man, and even after man's fall, God did not give up His purpose.</P><P>In order to accomplish His purpose, God Himself became a man. He identified Himself with man. He made Himself one with man. He came into man to be a man. Do you know what it means to be saved? To be saved, strictly speaking, is to have God incarnated into you to be one with you. To be saved is not just to be forgiven of your sins. To be saved is to have God identified with you, to have God incarnated in you, to have God become one with you.</P>
