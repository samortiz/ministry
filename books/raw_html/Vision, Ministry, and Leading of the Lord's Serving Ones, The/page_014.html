        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SPECIFIC WORK</h1>
<p>A serving one of the Lord must learn to do a definite work, a specific work. In other words, a serving one of the Lord cannot do an ordinary work. If a work is ordinary, it becomes something of little consequence. The works of many so-called serving ones of the Lord are of little consequence. Although a serving one may be able to do some work, such as speaking concerning God, the Lord, sin, and the cross, it is difficult to find a focus in his work. His work is like a long-winded writing that obscures the crucial points because of its lack of focus. As serving ones of the Lord, we must learn to be delivered from such works.</p>
<p>Our work must be specific and definite. Those of us who are learning to serve the Lord must never regard this point lightly; rather, we must deal with the Lord concerning this matter, pursue it, and always be learning. We should not do an ordinary work, a common work before the Lord but always focus on the goal of our work and do a specific work. Learning this lesson requires that we be broken before the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN IN OUR NATURAL DISPOSITION</h2>
<p>The natural man has a natural disposition, and every natural disposition has particular traits. Although the natural man always bears these natural traits, we cannot bring our natural disposition into the Lord&rsquo;s work. Our work should be specific, but this specific work cannot come out of our natural disposition. If our natural disposition has not been broken, we will not be able to learn the lesson of being specific before God or be able to see what the Lord specifically wants us to do. Rejecting our natural views and natural disposition is a basic requirement for doing a specific work with a specific goal.</p>
<p>A brother has particular views and opinions before he is saved. After he is saved, he will continue to live according to his views and opinions if he does not experience the breaking of his natural disposition. Hence, it will be impossible for him to receive the Lord&rsquo;s commission to do a specific work. Since his natural views and opinions are part of his subjective constitution, he will not have God&rsquo;s view, receive God&rsquo;s commission, or be able to do a specific work for God. A specific work is possible only when one allows his opinions to be broken.</p>
<p>In order to do a specific work in serving the Lord, we must receive a vision and a commission from the Lord. However, in order to receive a vision and a commission from the Lord, our natural views and natural opinions must be broken. If we serve the Lord without being broken, there will be no response in the spirit of God&rsquo;s people and no speaking, confirmation, or echo of the Holy Spirit within God&rsquo;s people. As a result, there will be no benefit and little consequence in our work.</p>
<p>For example, a brother may have a desire to help orphans before he is saved. Such a thought is not bad; in fact, it is good in man&rsquo;s eyes. After his salvation, when he reads Psalm 68:5, which says that God is &ldquo;a Father to the orphans and a Judge for the widows,&rdquo; he assumes that he has received a revelation. Since this word corresponds with his natural concept, it is easy for him to say to himself, &ldquo;Now that I am a child of God, I should be considerate of God&rsquo;s heart by helping and caring for orphans.&rdquo; He may even stand up in a meeting and say, &ldquo;We should care for the orphans, because God is a Father to the orphans.&rdquo; If no one responds the first week, he may speak a week later, saying, &ldquo;We should care about orphans, not just for our own children.&rdquo; He may continue to speak about the need to care for orphans, but if there is no response from the saints, he will eventually say to himself, &ldquo;Since I cannot get through here, I will try somewhere else.&rdquo; But even if he goes elsewhere, he will continue to &ldquo;hit a wall.&rdquo; Eventually, he will regard others as being selfish and become frustrated and indifferent toward them because of his opinions. Thus, the natural opinions of this brother will hinder him from seeing God&rsquo;s light, from seeing a vision. Natural opinions always come out of our natural disposition. As serving ones of the Lord, we must set aside our opinions in order to take part in His work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A CENTRAL VIEW AND QUALITY CONTENT</h2>
<p>We also must know the steps related to God&rsquo;s work; God does not want man to work according to his own opinions but according to a central view of His work. In the foregoing example, the work of the brother who wanted to run an orphanage was not according to the central view of God&rsquo;s work, as revealed in the Scriptures. The Bible speaks of God and of man, of God&rsquo;s desire for man and of man&rsquo;s fall, of God&rsquo;s accomplishment of redemption and of man&rsquo;s being led by the Holy Spirit to repent, believe, and receive the Lord to have the Lord&rsquo;s life and to live in the Lord for His church and kingdom. These are the central points. While I dare not call a brother&rsquo;s thought of running an orphanage wrong, the quality of its content cannot be considered to be high. The content of quality in the Bible points to God, man, sin, redemption, Christ, life, the Holy Spirit, the church, and the kingdom. To serve the Lord, we must pay attention to this content.</p>
<p>When we consider these major points and then listen to the testimonies of the brothers and sisters, it is clear that many testimonies fall short of these points. For example, a brother may testify about praying to the Lord for the return of his misplaced fountain pen and of the pen being found by a janitor and returned to him the next day. Many testimonies of the brothers and sisters are like this; they are not according to the central view, and it is sad to hear them.</p>
<p>The testimonies of others, who have been following the Lord for a long time, also seem to focus on gains and losses in spiritual matters. Their words are not worldly, but they have a concern only for their own spiritual gains and losses. Such persons remain in their &ldquo;smallness&rdquo; even with all the spiritual lessons they have learned. They are unable to see that they have imprisoned the Lord within them.</p>
<p>If a person sees the central items, such as the cross of Christ and Christ being life in man, he does not have time for trivial matters. However, those who have not seen God&rsquo;s kingdom and God&rsquo;s righteousness pray every day for things related to food and clothing (Matt. 6:25-33) and testify of God&rsquo;s slightest blessing like excited children who have received some candy.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s serving ones must see the central items. We need to set aside our own views and opinions, enter into God&rsquo;s presence, and see the central items in His Word. We should search out the central items and avoid the trivial items.</p>
<p>Please do not misunderstand me; I am not opposed to God&rsquo;s leading in the little things of our human life. However, we need to see that we have been raised up by the Lord for His work to present to man the things related to God, man, sin, redemption, Christ, life, the Holy Spirit, the church, and the coming kingdom. The major items span from eternity to eternity. God&rsquo;s plan in eternity demonstrates His wisdom and expresses His Son, Christ. This explains every other matter, such as God&rsquo;s creation. God created man and redeemed man for His expression. Christ&rsquo;s redemption on the cross and the life of Christ entering into man are for His expression. The church, which brings in the eternal kingdom, is also for His expression. All those who consecrate themselves to serve the Lord must see these central items.</p>
<p>Once we see these central items, we must prepare ourselves before the Lord to receive a specific commission, to see what God wants us to focus on specifically. Perhaps God will commission someone to specifically speak on sin; if so, he needs to speak of it in a serious manner. Sin is not a minor point, so some need to receive a specific commission to speak on it. Sometimes the brothers in a certain place cannot convey this truth with a proper emphasis even though they know this truth. When a brother who is commissioned to speak on this matter goes to this locality, the matter will become living to the saints, and his speaking will even impact the preaching of the gospel and the edification of the saints. After he serves for three or four months, all the brothers and sisters will see the matter of sin clearly.</p>
<p>I feel that the gospel preaching of the brothers is too ordinary and not specific. They have a set pattern of preaching. It is always along the line of believing in Jesus to be saved, receiving the forgiveness of sins, escaping eternal perdition, and having eternal life. Sometimes they go further and speak of believers having the Lord Jesus in them. This is not specific enough. They should devote one or two hours to develop specific items such as sin or God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>When D. L. Moody was preaching the gospel in England, a young man, Harry Moorehouse, spoke to Moody and asked if he could preach with Moody in America. Moody could not refuse him, but he would not tell him his sailing date. Nevertheless, Moorehouse followed Moody to America. When Moorehouse arrived, he sent a letter to Moody in the hope that he would be given an opportunity to preach. When Moody had to go out of town, he decided to let Moorehouse preach. The first day he preached on John 3:16, and everyone was quite touched. The second day he preached on John 3:16 again, and all were moved even more. When Moody returned, he asked his wife, &ldquo;What did the young man preach?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Something different from what you preach.&rdquo; Moody asked, &ldquo;Was it heresy?&rdquo; and she said, &ldquo;You will know when you hear him.&rdquo; When Moody listened, his tears flowed because he saw the matter of God&rsquo;s love. Before that day he had preached only on God&rsquo;s righteousness and judgment, but he did not know God&rsquo;s love until he heard Moorehouse&rsquo;s preaching. Later, when Moody&rsquo;s meeting place burned down in a fire and a new one was built, Moorehouse came to preach. When he got to the podium, he said, &ldquo;The old place of meeting has been burned, but the old topic cannot be burned. It is still John 3:16.&rdquo; Moorehouse knew God&rsquo;s love and God&rsquo;s specific commission.</p>
<p>As serving ones of the Lord, we should give our all to the Lord and be dealt with to such an extent that we do a specific work. There should be something in us that is God-commissioned and specific. Ordinary works are dispensable, and those who do ordinary works likewise are dispensable. The issue of an ordinary work is always limited. We must work to such an extent that we become indispensable. We should not say this out of pride but because it is a fact. If Moorehouse had not gone to Chicago, God&rsquo;s love would not have been known to such an extent. Without Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis&rsquo;s being raised up, the depths of the cross would not have been known to such an extent. In the New Testament John&rsquo;s writings have a focus, and Paul&rsquo;s Epistles have a focus. Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles have a specific focus. We must learn to do a specific work.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
