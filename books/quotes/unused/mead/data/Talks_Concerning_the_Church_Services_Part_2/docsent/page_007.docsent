   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE A PRACTICAL CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REALIZED IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter we saw the need to carry out our priestly service in a regular and diligent way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At this time we want to fellowship concerning the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although many of us have been faithful in the church life for years and love the Lord, the results of our labor have not been that satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This can mainly be proven by our barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the recovery came to the United States in 1962 and the ministry began to function, there were a good number of the Lord s seekers from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These twenty-five to fifty believers were ready and prepared to receive something as the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At this point they came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the first ten years from 1962 to 1972, the number of saints increased rapidly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, after 1972 the rate of increase slowed down very much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During those early years, I traveled frequently from the East to the West coast to speak to the seeking ones who had invited me to come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, wherever I went, some were gained by the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time most of them moved to Los Angeles and settled there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So, the increase in the church in Los Angeles was not an increase of local people, but it came from different cities far away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1970 over one hundred saints migrated out to two or three cities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was quite successful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everywhere they went, they met groups of seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Gradually within one year all of these seeking ones were also gained by the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This prevailing increase stirred up the attention of Christianity, but not in a good sense.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They became jealous and conspired to damage us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was the source of all the evil books that were written against us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After being defamed, we scarcely had any increase.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the total number of saints in the recovery is still about the same as it was fifteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the number of local churches has increased, the total number of members has not risen that much.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1974 more than one thousand were meeting in Orange County.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today there are less than one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One church in Orange County went from fifty to one hundred within one year.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today less than one hundred are meeting there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This bothered me quite deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From 1984 I felt that I could not go on in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I had to stop my work here because the results were disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a number of semi-annual trainings and other conferences, there was still the same number of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They all appreciated my ministry but very few new ones were brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the past five years we passed through many turmoils.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more that I have been attacked and defamed, the more I have the confirmation that what the Lord has shown us is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the very thing that the enemy hates.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The older and more experienced co-workers among us were quite useful in the first period of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when I began to be used by the Lord to bring in the so-called new way, it did not fit in with their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Due to the disposition of the opposing ones, they do not like the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to his disposition, one of the opposing ones prefers to give messages in the larger meetings and rarely preaches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, our disposition controls us in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may never have brought one new one to the Lord just because of our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the past we did not have the time to build the recovery up into a situation that we desired.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, according to our recent five-year study, the Lord has shown us from the Bible the God-ordained way that was never practiced properly among the Christians throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The proper way is the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This God-ordained way consists of four steps.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, we must practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not the common gospel preaching found in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the contrary, the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel is for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we must carry it out in a particular and trained way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, the Bible does not tell us everything in detail, but the New Testament does give us clear light and examples concerning the proper preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ephesians 4 says that the Head gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not only the apostles, the prophets, and the shepherd-teachers are mentioned here, but the evangelists are mentioned as well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must realize that the evangelists are also perfecters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The evangelists were given by the Head not only for preaching the gospel directly by themselves but also for perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The evangelists, in turn, should perfect the saints to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not think that to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel is an easy thing; it is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need some perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perfecting indicates that this is not a common thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, it is something particular.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are not just knocking on doors like the Mormons and Jehovah s Witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are fulfilling the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must learn how to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the Old Testament the priests began their training as apprentices at twenty-five years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They learned under a certain period of training for five years.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the age of thirty, they began to carry out their full responsibility as priests Num 4:3; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Luke 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Their duties included burning the incense and offering many kinds of offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Each offering had its own laws and regulations Lev 6 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In particular, there were many regulations concerning the peace offering Lev 7:11-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must realize that the New Testament priests are just priests of the gospel Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To preach the gospel is to go to contact people and visit them John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No one can deny this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Second, we must nourish and cherish the new ones like babies under the care of a nourishing mother.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Feeding is only needed three or five times a day, but cherishing lasts all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For example, when the weather is cold, a mother puts more clothing on her little child.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the temperature is hot, she removes some of the baby s clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If the child is crying, the mother knows how to calm down her little one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A mother also knows how to make so many things pleasant for her unhappy child.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is to cherish.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Apostle Paul said that he was such a nourishing mother and also an exhorting father 1 Thes 2:7, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The third step involves the perfecting of the saints in the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The perfecting is clearly revealed in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The last step is that all the saints must learn to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The entire chapter of 1 Corinthians 14 deals with this one thing, that is, speaking forth the Lord to minister Him to others that they may be nourished, edified, and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>As a result, the Body of Christ will be directly built up by everyone prophesying v. 26 . This God-ordained way is here in the Bible, and no one can deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>According to His principle, there must be a way to work out whatever the Lord says to us in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>One brother from the church in Seoul, Korea, recently told us that in 1985 they began to meet with seventeen saints in a small section of that large city of twelve to fourteen million people.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>That section of the city now has over three hundred meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He told us that they just practice according to whatever I speak.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As we are burdened to take the new way, we should consecrate ourselves to the Lord and have a time with the Lord each morning in order to be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This should be followed by a daily practice of overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Furthermore, we must practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel by going out to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>After much study, I found out that we do not need to knock on that many cold doors because we have too many warm doors already.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have many relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As ones who love the Lord, we should take care of our relatives and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>By visiting them we can bring them to be saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After a week we may gain others.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>At this point we may be caring for four different new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Instead of baptizing more, it is best to return to them to have home meetings in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This requires nourishing them first along with a great deal of cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We can then bring these three or four together to form a small group.</S>
