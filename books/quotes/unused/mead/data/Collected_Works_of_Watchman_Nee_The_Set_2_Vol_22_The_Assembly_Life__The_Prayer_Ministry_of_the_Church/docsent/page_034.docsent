   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God dislikes the fact that man can be misled to think that there must be centers on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, He put Jerusalem aside and made Antioch the place from which the apostles set off for their work Acts 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was not Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This avoided the misunderstanding that the church in Jerusalem was the mother church, the headquarters church, and that all the other churches were subordinate churches and branch churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two hundred years ago the Brethren almost took London as their headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, brothers, please do not consider the assembly in Shanghai as the mother church or the headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our assemblies in the different localities are directly bound by Christ and are not controlled by any other assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The truth that I am speaking of tonight balances the truth that was mentioned last Saturday evening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Last Saturday night we mentioned the Body life and the relationship between an assembly and other assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God will never tell one assembly to do something and another assembly not to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way God leads one assembly is the way He leads other assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We saw that the Gentile churches should imitate the churches in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also saw that, according to God's ordination, no church of God should act independently; rather it should pay attention to the move of the Body and seek for mutual harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Any person that one assembly excommunicates should be excommunicated by other assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today we are speaking on the responsibility of a local church; its responsibility is to God alone and not to any other local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we covered on Saturday shows us the strictness of the bondage and restrictions between one assembly and other assemblies; no assembly can act independently or make its own proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If an assembly acts independently or makes free proposals, these acts and moves are not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the same time, we must see that every church is directly responsible to the Head for what it does.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can easily become biased.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we must maintain the balance in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes, we may act like the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Rome makes a decision to do one thing, all the Roman Catholics in every place have to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not being balanced in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, we should be bound by other assemblies so that we have the same footsteps and are the same as far as the truth goes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, every assembly should be directly responsible to the Head for what it does.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every local church is responsible to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every church mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3, like the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, and the church in Pergamos, etc., had its own golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each stood on its own stand, not on another stand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every one of them kept their own position and was responsible to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord both rebuked and praised Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not lay the blame of Ephesus on Pergamos, nor did He credit the virtue of Ephesus to Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No church can take the responsibility of another church, and no church can stand on the merit of another church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the churches are responsible to the Lord directly and are bound by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time, the Bible says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the balance in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, the Bible says that the words are spoken to the messenger of the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But at the end of the speaking, it says that the words are for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the beginning it says that the words are for the messengers of the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, the church in Pergamos, etc., but at the end it says that every church should hear what God says to the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Holy Spirit is speaking to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why he who has an ear should hear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This proves that what is kept by one church should be kept by all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The responsibility each church bears in a locality is before God alone, yet all the churches should have the same common move.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consequently, the epistle was written to Ephesus, but the words were for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the balance in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Bible God has ordained that the smallest unit of the church on the earth is the local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The highest institution is also the local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The local church is the ultimate and minimal organization.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every local church is a miniature to express the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nothing is bigger than the local church, and nothing is smaller than the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should firmly grasp this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should pursue and take care that what we do in the assembly in Shanghai, our move and footsteps, is the same as the move and footsteps of all the assemblies in China.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not only should we pursue having the same move and footsteps as all the assemblies in China, but we should also pursue having the same move and footsteps as all the assemblies in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, what we do in the assembly in Shanghai and whether we are right or wrong is something for which we are directly responsible to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not directed by any higher institution above Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the assembly in Shanghai, no authority is higher than the authority of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the boundary that God has set.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Within each city, there can be a few elders.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But these elders can oversee only the assembly in that city; they cannot oversee the assembly in another city.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's boundary is based on the fact that elders are appointed in every city.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why the authority of an elder cannot extend beyond the boundary of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The local churches as depicted in the Bible are local in their administration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope that the brothers and sisters maintain these two aspects in a balanced way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, we maintain a sameness with the other assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the other hand, each local assembly bears a direct responsibility to God.</S>
