<h1 class="title">BUILDING AND CONSECRATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:1-15; Rom. 6:19; 12:1, 4-5</h1>
<p>Several key points are presented in 1 Corinthians 3:1-15. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. But neither yet now are you able.&rdquo; In this verse Paul speaks to the Corinthian believers concerning feeding. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Ministers through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each one of them.&rdquo; Here Paul speaks concerning guiding people to believe. In verse 6 he says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered.&rdquo; This verse is concerning planting and watering, both of which are in relation to plants. Paul seems to be saying that the believers are &ldquo;God&rsquo;s cultivated land&rdquo; (v. 9) because they have the divine life; hence, they need planting as well as watering. In verses 9, 10, and 12 Paul says, &ldquo;We are God&rsquo;s fellow workers...I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each man take heed how he builds upon it...If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble.&rdquo; These verses are concerning building.</p>
<p>This passage contains four key points: feeding, guiding, planting and watering, and building. These four points reveal how the apostles built up the church. Paul fed people as much as they were able to receive. The apostles guided people to believe, even as the Lord gave to each one. To believe is to have faith. This faith refers not only to the faith that enables people to be regenerated; it also refers to the faith that enables people to touch every spiritual matter. Our faith enables us to receive spiritual things from the Lord, and we need to be guided into this faith. Paul says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth&rdquo; (v. 6). Paul considered himself as a planter and Apollos as a waterer. Both Paul and Apollos worked together with God to take care of God&rsquo;s cultivated land (v. 9). Paul was also a wise master builder who laid a foundation, and others were building upon that foundation (v. 10). The foundation is Jesus Christ (v. 11), and the building materials must be gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12)</p>
<p>In the Bible gold signifies the nature of God the Father, silver signifies the redemption of Christ the Son and the principle of the cross, and precious stones signify the constituting and transforming work of the Holy Spirit. Hence, gold, silver, and precious stones signify the threefold work of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Gold is of God the Father, silver is what the Son accomplished on the cross, and precious stones are what the Spirit is producing in us. We received God&rsquo;s nature when we were regenerated. Since then, the cross has been working in us to remove the old creation and bring in the new creation. At the same time, the Holy Spirit is working to constitute and transform us by disciplining us outwardly and by operating within us. The issue of this threefold work is our possessing the image of God. This is the work of gold, silver, and precious stones.</p>
<p>Paul also speaks of another kind of work, the work of wood, grass, and stubble. Wood is in contrast to gold, grass is in contrast to silver, and stubble is in contrast to precious stones. According to typology, wood signifies the nature of man. In the Old Testament the Ark and other furniture in the tabernacle were made of wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 25:11-14, 23-24, 28). Here gold signifies the divinity of the Lord Jesus, and wood signifies His humanity. Wood overlaid with gold signifies that the Lord Jesus possesses both divinity and humanity. He is God entering into man and putting on humanity. In the Lord Jesus there is humanity, signified by wood, and divinity, signified by gold. In the Bible grass, which is in contrast to silver, signifies the flesh. Hence, 1 Peter 1:24 says, &ldquo;All flesh is like grass.&rdquo; Silver signifies the work of the cross. The cross of Christ terminates, deals with, and eliminates man&rsquo;s flesh. Therefore, grass is in contrast to silver. Stubble signifies the earthly condition, that is, the absence of a heavenly condition. Stubble is worthless. It neither illuminates nor shines and hence has absolutely no value. It is in contrast to the transparent and invaluable precious stones.</p>
<p>Feeding, guiding, planting and watering, and building are the four key points in the work of the apostles. However, feeding people, guiding them to believe, and planting and watering are for the purpose of building. Feeding is for building, guiding people to believe is for building, and planting and watering are also for building. There are various aspects to the work of the apostles, but there is only one purpose&mdash;building.</p>
<p>I sense that we have all seen the vision of God&rsquo;s building, and we are willing to be built by God and participate in His building. In other words, we are willing to be built up, and we are also willing to build up others. However, according to my observation, we are still unclear concerning how to practically be built up. We do not know how to begin, because we have not touched the way of building. Hence, in this chapter we will fellowship concerning the practice of building.</p>
<p>Building is not a simple matter. Sweeping the floor and cleaning are simple and do not involve many techniques, but building a house is not simple. A house cannot be built by a layman. Building a house requires a professional who is experienced in the field of construction. The building up of the church is even more difficult and complex than building in the physical realm. We cannot merely speak about building without having the reality of the building. We must see the blueprint of the building as well as the details, such as how to lay the foundation, how to use the materials, and how to set the beams, build the walls, place the roof tiles, install the doors and windows, and decorate the interior and the exterior. We must know the details related to the practice of building.</p>
