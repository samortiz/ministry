The Third Parable</H2><P>In 23:27&#151;24:13 we have Balaam's third parable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Balak Bringing Balaam to the Top of Peor</H2><P>Balak said to Balaam, "Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there" (23:27). Then Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor (v. 28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Balaam Asking Balak to Build<br>for Him Seven Altars, to Provide for Him<br>Seven Bulls and Seven Rams, and to Offer<br>a Bull and a Ram on Each Altar</H2><P>"Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and provide for me here seven bulls and seven rams. And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar" (vv. 29-30). The offering of the bulls and the rams was ambiguous; it is not clear to whom they were offered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Balaam Seeing That It Pleased Jehovah<br>to Bless Israel, Not Going to Seek for Omens<br>but Setting His Face toward the Wilderness</H2><P>"When Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go, as at other times, to seek for omens" (24:1a). Rather, Balaam set his face toward the wilderness, lifted up his eyes, and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes (vv. 1b-2).</P>
