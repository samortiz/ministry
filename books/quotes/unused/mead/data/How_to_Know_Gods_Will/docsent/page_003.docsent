   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONDITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR KNOWING GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not like to hear people asking how to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every one of us should already be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's will is revealed only to those who have consecrated their will to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He does not force us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is always waiting for us to become willing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not matter much if a person knows God's will; it is more important that a person be willing to choose God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to say to the Lord, "Not according to my will, but according to Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we lay down our selves, we will know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once in a sisters' meeting in Hangchow, two sisters asked me if God's will is based upon circumstance, upon the Bible, or upon other principles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I heard this, my heart sank, and I answered in a harsh way although my heart was not harsh , saying, "Knowing God's will is not a matter of method.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may have the right methods, and you may act faithfully according to these methods step by step, but you will still not know God's will."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As I was speaking, my eyes were fixed on the two sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I then asked, "What kind of persons are you?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person's knowledge of God's will has to do with that person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a person is not right, no method will work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can God reveal His will to persons like you?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You do not have to ask many questions, and you do not have to ask God for methods.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God can reveal His will in many ways; He can reveal it through the wind, the thunder, a child, or a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You only need to ask whether persons like you are qualified to know God's will."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Genesis 18 when God was about to destroy the city of Sodom, He came to Abraham because He could not hide this matter from him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abraham was a friend of God James 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was not a slave of God, because a slave does not know the mind of the master; only a friend knows the mind of a friend John 15:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was no barrier between Abraham and God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why God could not hide what He was about to do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lot was Abraham's relative; he might have had a great deal of spiritual knowledge, but God did not speak with Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He only told Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It would be a joke if Lot came to me and asked, "How can I know God's will?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Abraham was qualified to know God's will, but Lot was not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It would be useless even if Lot had all the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lot was still Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are you Abraham or are you Lot?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many people today pay attention to the method of knowing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is a need of learning the methods, but one must be an Abraham to learn the methods.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a Lot is learning them, the best methods will not work because he is a person living in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has not dealt with the world and his position.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we must apply God's light to see if there are sins in us, great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Have we committed any unrighteousnesses?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do we owe anyone anything?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Have we been loose in our conduct or wrong in our words, gestures, and attitudes?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are we still holding on to something?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All of these big and small sins affect our ability to know God's will.</S>
