   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to Romans eight.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This chapter begins with a declaration in the first verse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I like this term, in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all have been put into Christ, and now we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Christ there is no condemnation because in Christ there is nothing negative, dark or sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are outside of Christ, we will be full of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in Christ everything is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore there is no condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not look at ourselves or consider our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we look at ourselves, we will be in real trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore we must realize that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just as Paul declared it, we must declare it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all need to say, Hallelujah, I am in Christ, and here there is no condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no condemnation in Christ because in Christ there is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Christ there is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A law is a natural governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all know that gravity is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you throw anything into the air, it comes down.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no need to pray to the Lord to send it back to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we pray in that way, we are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law of gravity will take care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the same way in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Christ there is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The law, the Spirit, and the life are all in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE LAW OF REJOICING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>More than thirty years ago I was deep in trial.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I remembered the verse that said we must rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was suffering very much; so I really needed to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But how could I rejoice?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I tried to rejoice again and again, but I simply could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I understand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To rejoice is not an act; it is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we try to rejoice, that is just an act.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we keep the principle of the spiritual law, spontaneously we will be rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rejoicing is a law that belongs to the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of life is nothing less than Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ Himself is the Spirit of life, and within Him there is such a law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I tried to rejoice more than thirty years ago in that situation, I failed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But now I have learned to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After calling for a few minutes, it is easy to rejoice, for the rejoicing One lives within me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we touch Him, and He is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Within Him there is the law of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord that there is such a law within us!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE LAW OF HOLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Within Christ there is also the law of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we have Jesus living within us as our life, spontaneously it will be easy to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is because holiness is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since Christ lives within us as our life and our person there is a law of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Regardless of how many times the Devil casts us into a defiled situation, the law of holiness spontaneously keeps us from being unholy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ living within us as our life, is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this Spirit of life there is an automatic law that frees us from anything of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no condemnation in Christ for the law of the Spirit of life has set us free from the law of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the indwelling Christ with the liberating law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>THE STANDING LAW</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to many of the teachings in Christianity, it seems that it is very hard for a Christian to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am afraid that there are still many that hold this kind of concept.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But this is absolutely a wrong teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To fall is really hard.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>While you are standing, try to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can all stand so steadfastly because of the gravity of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is harder for a Christian to fall than to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many times I have tried to fall away from the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Even though I tried to fall, I still ended up in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is not so easy for us to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Occasionally we may stumble, but immediately we will regain our footing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After stumbling, we will hate what has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This will make us more careful the next time concerning what caused us to stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A Christian has a standing law.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Within all Christians there is the standing strength and the standing governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the life of Christ as the standing law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The law of the Spirit of life has set us free.</S>
