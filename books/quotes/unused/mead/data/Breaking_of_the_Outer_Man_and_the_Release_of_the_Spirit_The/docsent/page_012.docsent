   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We usually feel God's presence only when we come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whatever we do, even when we exercise the utmost care, we feel that we have turned away from God a little.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am afraid that this is most of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we conscientiously try to rein ourselves in, we turn away as soon as we engage in some activity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many brothers and sisters feel that they have to drop the things they have in their hands before they can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They somehow feel that there is a difference between being in God and doing some form of work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, we may be helping a person by preaching the gospel to him or by edifying him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Halfway through our conversation, we may feel that we have to pray and come back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We feel that we have somehow drifted from God in talking to others and that by praying we can come back to Him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems as if we have moved and are returning to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have lost His presence, and now we are regaining it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may be conducting some daily chores such as scrubbing the floor or working at some craft.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we are finished with this work, we feel that we have to come back before we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We feel that there is a great distance between where we are and where we want to be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Any feeling of coming back is a sign that we have moved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The breaking of the outer man will bring us to the point where we will not have to come back any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will feel as much of God's presence in talking to others as when we are kneeling down and praying with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will feel as much of God's presence in scrubbing the floor and working on our craft as when we are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These things will not take us away from God's presence any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, we will no longer need to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let me give a more extreme example.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The most raw sentiment a man can have is temper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible does not say that we cannot be angry; some forms of anger are unrelated to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible says that we should "be angry, yet do not sin" Eph 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows that a person can become angry without sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet anger is a very raw sentiment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In fact, it is close to sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's Word never says that we should love yet not sin, because love is far from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nor does God's Word say that we should be patient yet not sin, because patience is also far from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God's Word says, "Be angry, yet do not sin."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows that anger is very close to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes a brother commits a big mistake, and we have to rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this is a very hard thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is easy to exercise kindness but very hard to exercise anger.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once we are careless, we will fall into a different state.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not easy to be angry according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we know the breaking of the outer man, we can enjoy God's continual presence without interruption from the outer man, whether we are rebuking a brother severely or praying in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Putting this a different way, we will not have the feeling that we are turning back to God when we pray after rebuking a brother severely.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any feeling of turning back to God is a proof that we have left God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I admit that rebuking a brother is a difficult thing to do, but if our outer man is broken, we can rebuke a brother without the need of turning back to God because God's presence will be with us all the time.</S>
