You have to ask the Lord together: "What do You want to achieve in tonight's meeting?" In every meeting the Lord goes on. He has a purpose. Do not take anything for granted. Do not think that since the meetings are regular, one can be loose. Brother Weigh plays tennis. Surely he does not make his plan at the last minute before the game. He has to consider beforehand. The same is true with spiritual things. We cannot meet in a routine way or leave things to chance. We have to learn to touch the Spirit of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Exercising Human Hands Too Much</h2><p>The responsible ones should not take the attitude of a spectator; they should not sit back and watch what the brothers and sisters are doing. The responsible brothers cannot be passive. They must be active. Their heart must be open to the Lord. In leading the saints on, they should not exercise human hands too much. They should not monopolize everything. They should learn to wait and give the Holy Spirit the opportunity to inwardly lead the saints.</p><h2 class="head2">Believing in the Holy Spirit<br />and Touching the Holy Spirit</h2><p>The responsible ones should also believe that the Holy Spirit will work as long as we do not hinder His work. We do not need to encourage or stir up the Holy Spirit. The heart and spirit of every responsible one must be open. They must push their spirit out in the meetings. Some people never open their mouths. This means that there is something wrong with them. There are times in the meetings when the saints cannot lift up the spirit. We have to charge forward at such times. Sometimes the brothers and sisters go off on tangents, and we have to bring the meeting back on course with hymns, prayers, or speakings. On the one hand, the responsible brothers cannot be too artificial. On the other hand, they cannot be too loose. We must learn to touch the Spirit ourselves first and learn to conduct the meeting according to the leading of the Spirit. The elders and district leaders must come together often to study together. They should make adjustments for the meetings and correct the meetings as needed. They have to discuss the way the brothers and sisters selected the hymns, prayed, and spoke in the previous meeting. They may observe that if a brother had stopped his prayer at a certain point, it would have been most excellent. There was no need for the brother to go on. The same thing can be said about speaking. They have to adjust and correct the saints one by one. Some people should stop at a certain point; everything they say after that point is redundant. A person should stop his prayer at the point where the "amen" is the loudest. But some people pray until all the amens are drained away, and even then they do not stop. If everyone learns this way, we will be more accurate in touching the Spirit in a meeting.</p><p>The Holy Spirit in the church works beyond what we can ask or think. Therefore, we should not expect to receive merely what we hope to receive; we should expect something higher, not something lower. In the meetings a brother may stand up to correct something. His correction may not be accurate, but he may consider himself to be perfectly right. If, in the course of their fellowship, all the brothers feel that something was wrong with this one's correction, he should put a question mark on what he thinks is right. Such fellowship will deliver us out of subjectivity and enable us to touch the thought of the Holy Spirit more.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Flesh, yet at the Same Time<br />Encouraging Everyone to Function</h2><p>If a brother or sister is in the habit of speaking contrary things, the elders alone may not be that effective in dealing with him or her. There is the need of a few more brothers and sisters to speak the truth in love to this brother or sister. It is wrong to have love without the liberty to speak the truth. Sometimes a man speaks the truth, but he does not have love. This is also wrong. If you want to correct anyone, you must learn first to pray and then correct him in a spirit of meekness (Gal. 6:1). At the same time, you cannot do this in a sectarian way. You cannot base your decision on the idea of a few people. You cannot say that anyone who opposes your will is automatically wrong. You have to be clear about the will of the Spirit and touch the flow of the Spirit. A brother may decide not to pray after he is rebuked. You have to exhort him and encourage him to pray again. On the one hand, we have to believe in the leading of the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, it will be easy for the flesh to be set loose if we give the brothers and sisters too much liberty. Hence, we must exercise authority to deal with the flesh. If we do not exercise authority, the meetings will be in confusion. At the same time, we must not allow the brothers and sisters to quench their spirit; they must function.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
