   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Proper Start for the New Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a big difference between a proper salvation and an improper salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One woman can give birth to a twelve-ounce baby, whereas another can give birth to a twelve-pound baby.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church should bear the responsibility in its ministry to help the new ones have a good beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a great difference between the way taken by those who have a proper beginning and those who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among those raised up by the Lord throughout the ages, many have not had a good beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once a person has a good beginning, he can go on in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as the beginning is clear-cut, he can go on properly no matter how little he understands and sees at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are others who dragged their feet when they first came in. With such, their way cannot be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once a person is saved, he should have a clear-cut separation from sin and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The question of money has to be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The question of consecration has to be settled, and the question of individualism also has to be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What the future holds for a person depends on God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After Paul brought others to salvation, he committed those who were saved to the grace of God Acts 14:23; 20:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no doubt that a person needs God's grace in the way ahead, but in the initial stage, there must be a clear-cut salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the beginning is not good, the make-up lesson later will not be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL The Need for the Work</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>of the Holy Spirit in the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Tang: Is it one thing to go to God and another thing to go before man?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee: There are six lines to take in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One can start from love, righteousness, judgment, sin, the world, or vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, no matter which line you take, there is the need of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is just one thing: to subdue a person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The real gospel is one that subdues and softens a person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All those who think that they are doing God a favor by believing in Him are unqualified ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a person sees the gospel, whether it is through the preaching of love, righteousness, or judgment, he will surely be softened and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Center of the Gospel Being God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we preach the gospel, we have to present the proper way to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The question of the world and our service to the Lord must be dealt with together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to see that the center of the gospel is God, not ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not that we gain something for ourselves, but that God gains something for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As soon as a person is saved, he has to realize that everything belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our occupations are not ours; they are God's. The doctors have to see that their occupation is not to be a doctor, but to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are only working as a doctor on the side.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man is not willing to take this way or to accept the Lord and be baptized, we will not force him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we cannot lower the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As soon as a person is saved, we have to tell him that from now on he is no longer an individual person, but a member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As such, he needs to learn to listen to others and to submit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the church will not take this way, it will always remain substandard.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If Brother Tang drinks cow's milk today, no one will laugh at him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if he still took his mother's milk, it would be a big joke.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Strictly speaking, the church should have learned obedience already.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But now it is going back to re-learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, in order to take the straight way today, we have to put everything upon a person the day that he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who are saved must begin in a proper way.</S>
