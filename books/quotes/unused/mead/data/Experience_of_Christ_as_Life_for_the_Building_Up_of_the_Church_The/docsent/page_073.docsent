   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout its history the church has always been divided by gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But it can never be divided by the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we focus our attention on the gifts, we will be divided within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if we forget about the gifts and pay our full attention to the ministry of life, we will always be kept in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why we stress again and again that the gifts cannot build up a local church, but the ministry can.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are a Christian worker and you are always trying to argue with others, this proves that you merely have a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>People with the ministry of life will never argue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Argument goes along with gifts and doctrinal teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we pay our attention to gifts and teachings, we will argue.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if we focus our attention on the ministry of life, we will not have anything to argue about.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gifts and teachings with doctrinal debates and arguments tear down the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The local church can be built up only by the ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some may not like noisy meetings, whereas others do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not debate about this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we need is the life of Christ, not a certain kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ministry of life does not come out of the doctrinal study and teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It comes out of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are really in the hand of the Lord, the Lord will form a ministry with you through all kinds of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is so strange and wonderful that there is nothing mentioned about the gifts in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead there is a list of Paul's sufferings in chapter one, chapter four, chapter six, and chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then in chapter twelve he told us of such a subjective suffering a thorn in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He asked the Lord particularly to take this away, but the Lord refused.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There would be no miracle, no divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, there would be suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through the suffering, Paul experienced the Lord as the sufficient grace, which was the perfect power in his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, Paul learned to say, "I will rather boast in my weaknesses" 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He also said, "I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses, on behalf of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am powerful" v. 10 . This is the way to have the growth in life so that a ministry might be produced for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is needed for the building up of a local church is the ministry of life, not the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to illustrate this point, I would like to tell a story about Brother Watchman Nee and an elder sister by the name of Miss Barber, who helped him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a young man, Brother Nee always admired good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he and Miss Barber went to hear a few speakers, Brother Nee told her how wonderful they were.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Miss Barber would say, "That is just doctrine with human eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no life there."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, there was no ministry with these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Nee told me this at the beginning of my service in the Lord because he was trying to help me to know the difference between a ministry and a gift, that is, between the utterance of something of life and human eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A person may be born with the gift of eloquence, but his speaking may be merely sounding brass.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is nice for listening, but there is no content of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another may be awkward in his speech, but you realize that there is something weighty with what he speaks because he has the ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This can come only out of the sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The building up of the church needs this ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all need to continue in the growth in life that we may have more ministries among us for the building up of the church.</S>
