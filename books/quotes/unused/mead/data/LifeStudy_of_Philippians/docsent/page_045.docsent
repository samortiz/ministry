   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is very important to realize that if we hold such an attitude because of differences in the soul, this will cause our experience of Christ to be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We shall not be able to experience Him to the full extent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, our experience of Christ will be limited to what we experience in our fellowship with Him in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We shall be hindered from going further to experience Christ in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of the differences of our emotion, understanding, or decision regarding certain matters, we are different in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such differences keep us from the full experience of Christ, the experience of Him in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not experience Christ in the Body, we do not experience Him in full.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only by experiencing Christ in the Body do we experience Him to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to experience Christ in the Body, our experience needs to be corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, to have a corporate experience of Christ we need to be like-souled with others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is vitally important that we learn to be like-souled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>An elder must learn to be like-souled with other elders, and all the members of a local church need to learn to be like-souled with the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Throughout the years we have seen a number of saints who have been held back from full participation in the church life because they were not like-souled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, some have not been willing to give themselves to the church service in a positive, aggressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They could excuse their lack of involvement by saying they do not want to cause trouble, but want to keep the situation calm.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the true reason for their holding back is that they are not like-souled and are not willing to risk their souls in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know some brothers who have truly behaved like gentlemen in their involvement with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They have been honest and good and have not caused turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, because of their difference of opinion, because of not being like-souled, they eventually forsook the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When these brothers gave up the church life, they did not criticize us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They simply went their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The underlying reason for leaving the church life was holding on to the differences in their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out, the divisions among Christians originate mainly from such differences in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Other saints who are not like-souled have chosen to remain in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But toward the church life in general and toward the church service in particular, they have a negative attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of offending others or causing trouble, they withdraw and become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, they do not leave the Lord s recovery; on the other hand, they do not go on with the church in a strong, positive, aggressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Paul wrote to the Philippians, he had a number of co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, Paul said that, apart from Timothy, he had no one like-souled who would genuinely care for what concerned the believers in Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul s situation with respect to the co-workers was quite difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, there were a number of co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But, when Paul was thinking of sending a brother to learn of the situation among the Philippian saints, he knew that he had only one, Timothy, who was like-souled with him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, Timothy was the only co-worker Paul could send to Philippi to care for the things concerning the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Any co-worker who could not be sent by Paul with such a concern for the Body of Christ could not experience Christ to the same degree Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because Timothy was like-souled with Paul, he was in a position to experience Christ to the uttermost in the Body, just as Paul was experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But those who were different in soul from Paul could not experience Christ to this high degree.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their experience of Christ was restricted by the differences in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST BY RISKING OUR SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Philippians, Paul speaks not only of being like-souled, but also of risking our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He says of Epaphroditus that he risked his life, his soul, in order to fill up the lack of the Philippians service toward Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we speak of Epaphroditus risking his soul, some may say that Paul s meaning here is that Epaphroditus did not love his physical life, but was willing to give it up for the sake of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is certainly true to say that Epaphroditus risked his physical life for the sake of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, this implies that he risked his soul.</S>
