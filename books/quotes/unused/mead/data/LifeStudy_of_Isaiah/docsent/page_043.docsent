   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST UNVEILED AS IMMANUEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Isaiah Christ is unveiled first as the Shoot of Jehovah 4:2a and then as the Fruit of the earth 4:2b , as a canopy to cover all the interests of God in the whole universe 4:5 , and as a tabernacle overshadowing God's chosen people 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eventually, this Christ becomes the center of an all-inclusive sign the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The real fulfillment of this sign was the Lord's incarnation Matt 1:20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ came, He was Immanuel, which means God with us Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is revealed not only in Matthew 1 but also in Matthew 28, where the Lord Jesus says, "Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age" v. 20 . Actually, the entire New Testament is an Immanuel, and we are now a part of this great Immanuel that will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Immanuel Being Our Sanctuary</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ as Immanuel, as the Son born of a virgin, is our sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This sanctuary is the place where we may live, dwell, and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are God's priests, His worshippers, and the sanctuary is the place where we dwell with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Christ was incarnated, He became a tabernacle John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tabernacle is a general term used to denote the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For us today, the sanctuary is the innermost part of the temple where we as God's priests worship God, serve God, and dwell with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To the Opposers Christ Being a Smiting Stone,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>a Rock of Stumbling, a Trap, and a Snare</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ has many opposers, including the Gentile nations who have invaded His land.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These nations compose the image in Daniel 2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To them, Christ will be the smiting stone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Daniel 2:34 and 35, He will be the stone that smashes the image into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the four Gospels we can see that when Christ was on earth, He was opposed by another category of people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those in this category included the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Herodians, the scribes, the elders, and certain of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To those in this category Christ was a rock of stumbling Isa 8:14b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ones who fell upon this rock were broken to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, many of those who opposed Christ were cunning and subtle, and in their subtlety they tried to trap or to snare the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the Lord's last visit to Jerusalem, the Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, scribes, and others tried over a period of four days to trap Him, to snare Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, they were eventually trapped and snared by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To them, Christ was a trap and a snare Isa 8:14c .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We thank the Lord that to us who believe in Him, He, as Immanuel, is our sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Him we have God's presence, and God's presence is our dwelling, the place where we worship God and serve Him.</S>
