   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN OPEN LETTER Issue No. 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our heart is full of a sense of gratitude as we send out another issue of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although it is not a great work of any kind, it is a testimony for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the matter of serving Him, nothing is too small or unworthy of our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is quite amazing to consider how men like us could serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Grace saves us, and it is also grace that gives us the privilege of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Presently, we are still in a time of waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is still examining our living so that the sacrifice of the burnt offering will not have any blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We enjoy proclaiming the grace and mercy of God, but toleration of any unrighteousness was never the intention of God's grace and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we put our past living and work in God's light, how ugly and detestable our flesh is!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we would rather avoid it, we must not be afraid of knowing the self too thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has many words to speak; our duty is to listen quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sister Lee and Sister Wang, two sisters in our midst, are still in the area of Amoy, working in the name of the Lord among the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We thank the Lord that He has used them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the meetings have not been great or widely publicized, God has been using them to perfect His daughters and to simultaneously release many who were bound by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One brother said in a letter, "Thank the Lord, who through His sent ones at this time is releasing quite a few."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Certainly, only the truth can set people free.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since they have not yet returned, those who are bearing the responsibility before the Lord to pray should continue to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, concerning the publication of The Present Testimony, in these few months we have really seen the hand of the Lord, confirming that our move has been of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Letters of testimony from various places have increased our strength quite much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our hope is that we may be an up-to-date testimony for God in these end times.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are deeply thankful for all the help from God's faithful stewards.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although this is a heavy burden in the first month 2,000 were printed and in the second month 2,500 , as yet there has been no hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If God's grace has been trustworthy in the past, then in the future also it will not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May God bless you all!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One with you always,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Watchman Nee</S>
