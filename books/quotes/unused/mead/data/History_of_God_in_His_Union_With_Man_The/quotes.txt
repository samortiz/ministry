[1]  CONTENTS God's History in Eternity Past God's History in Time
[2]  CHAPTER ONE GOD'S HISTORY IN ETERNITY PAST OUTLINE The name of God: Jehovah, meaning I Am Who I Am self-existing and ever-existing Exo 3:14.
[3]  In this series of messages, I will be speaking concerning the Christian life from another angle, from the angle of God's history.
[4]  The living, purposeful, active, and acting God surely needs a history, a biography.
[5]  The first thing we have to let people know in a biography is the name of the person about whom the biography is written.
[6]  This is why we need to know the name of God.
[7]  Another name for God is the Hebrew title Elohim, implying the faithful strong One Gen 1:1; 2:4 .
[8]  There is one God but the pronouns here are "Us" and "Our," indicating that there is a plurality with God.
[9]  God in His Divine Trinity held a council in eternity Acts 2:23 and note 1 Recovery Version .
[10]  Acts 2:23 says that Christ was "delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God."
[11]  In eternity past God chose us to be holy, to be sanctified unto Himself with His holy nature v. 4 . In eternity past God chose us to have His nature, indicating that He would be one with us, that is, that His nature would become our nature.
[12]  In eternity past God predestinated us, marking us out, unto sonship, making us sons to Himself with His divine life Eph 1:5a .
[13]  Thus, God blessed us in eternity past with two things with His nature and with His divine life.
[14]  JUDGING SATAN AND THE UNIVERSE OUTLINE Creating the universe: God created the heavens and the earth Gen 1:1: God created the heavens with all the living things in the heavens: Stretching forth the heavens Isa 42:5a; Zech 12:1a.
[15]  God is omnipotent, but apart from the Bible there is no record about Him in the whole universe.
[16]  It is even hard to find a record concerning some of the false gods.
[17]  Based upon this principle, the story about Jacob is even more interesting.
[18]  His name means one who grasps the heel, and he was surely a grasper.
[19]  Here you can see that although one of God's chosen people was so cunning, God was working on him to change him from being a grasper into being a prince.
[20]  Why is the record of God in eternity past so short?
[21]  God spread forth not only the earth but also all the things that spring up from the earth Isa 42:5b .
[22]  JUDGING SATAN AND THE UNIVERSE A. Satan was One of the Early Angels
[23]  Satan's heart was lifted up because of his beauty and his brightness Ezek.
[24]  The more you read a book like Genesis, the more you must admit that the Bible is really a record of God's movements; it is the history of God.
[25]  You cannot say that the record in Genesis is merely a record of mankind.
[26]  Then there is another and in this verse, indicating that something more happened: "And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
[27]  The light that was restored on the first day was good only for the lowest life, that is, the plant life.
[28]  Genesis 1 and 2 are very strange, wonderful, and mysterious in the revelation of God's creation of man.
[29]  When God created man, He first made a form for man.
[30]  After God made man as a duplication of Himself, He put this duplication, a living being with a spirit, soul, and body, before two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[31]  The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan.
[32]  God warned man not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that he ate of it, he would die v. 17 . This is also a part of the history of God in creating man.
[33]  Merely to have a tree with a river flowing issuing in three kinds of materials to illustrate God's purpose in creating man is not adequate.
[34]  In the past term of our full-time training, we studied the Christian life quite much.
[35]  We have seen that the Holy Scripture is not only a record of stories of man but also a record of the history of God in His union with man.
[36]  In God's carrying out of His eternal economy, God's adversary Satan caused two great frustrations: one was Satan's rebellion, which polluted and devastated the creation of God, and the other was his seducing of man to transgress against God.
[37]  It was both a matter of an offense that caused man to be condemned by God to remain under the condemnation of God Rom 5:18a and a matter of disobedience that caused man to be constituted a sinner in the eyes of God Rom 5:19a .
[38]  For man to hide himself from God is to keep himself away from God in his fellowship with God.
[39]  God also assigned a certain amount of suffering to the woman and the man vv.
[40]  This is the story of God in His acting to rescue man, to become man's redemption, and to become man's clothing, man's covering, man's righteousness, so that man can be in God to become one with God.
[41]  Judging the world from Cain to Babel: While working on His chosen saints positively, God was judging negatively the rest of Adam's descendants who took Satan's way of death based upon the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and became the world under God's condemnation: God had no respect unto Cain and his offering Gen 4:5.
[42]  We want to continue to see God's history in time in the book of Genesis.
[43]  We have seen that in time God worked to restore the judged universe and create man Gen 1:2 2:25 .
[44]  I. WORKING ON HIS SAINTS FROM ABEL TO NOAH A. After Saving Adam, God Continuing
[45]  After saving Adam, God continued to work on some of his descendants who took God's way of life based upon the principle of the tree of life and became God's saints according to God's election.
[46]  God prophesied concerning the deluge through Enoch naming his son Methuselah, which means "when he is dead, it the deluge shall be sent" Gen 5:21 .
[47]  Before God called Abraham, God worked on His saints from Abel to Noah, the forefathers of God's chosen people.
[48]  Instead of offering the God-ordained sacrifice to God, he offered the produce of the earth to God.
[49]  Speaking to him the tenth time to prove him by asking him to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering to Him and he passing His proving; speaking to him the eleventh time to stop him from offering his son Isaac and he replacing Isaac with a ram typifying Christ John 1:29 for a burnt offering; and speaking to him the twelfth time to promise him that He would multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand on the seashore, and in his seed Christ Gal 3:16; Matt 1:1b all the nations of the earth would be blessed Gen 22:1-19.
[50]  Thus far, we have seen God's history in eternity past.
[51]  We have also seen His history in time in creating the universe, in judging Satan and the universe, and in restoring the judged universe and creating man.
[52]  Even the creating of man is part of the real history of God.
[53]  In this message we want to see God's history in the life of Abraham.
[54]  In Genesis 22 God tried Abraham by asking him to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering.
[55]  Abraham was obedient to God's desire, and he was charged to offer Isaac on Mount Moriah v. 2 . Mount Moriah eventually became Mount Zion, the place where the temple was built in Jerusalem 2 Chron 3:1 . When Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, God intervened.
[56]  Then Abraham saw a ram caught in a thicket and he offered that ram up for a burnt offering instead of his son Gen 22:13 .
[57]  Because Abraham did not withhold his only son in obeying God, God promised him that He would multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand on the seashore, and that in his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed vv.
[58]  He called Abraham the first time by appearing to him as the God of glory Gen 11:31; Acts 7:2-4a .
[59]  God promised Abraham to make of him a great country, to make his name great, and to bless him and make him a blessing to others Gen 12:2-3 .
[60]  This was something apparently not motivated by God but motivated by Melchisedec, the King of Salem and the priest of God.
[61]  In other instances in the Bible, God could be called only the God of heaven 2 Chron 36:23; Neh 1:5; 2:4, 20 because of the lack of someone standing with God on earth to defeat God's enemies and gain the victory for God.
[62]  Abraham believed in God, and God reckoned it to him for righteousness v. 6 . Romans 4 develops this point strongly by saying that Abraham was a forefather of all the ones who are justified by God through believing into Jesus Christ.
[63]  God did not speak to Abraham for thirteen years because he took Hagar as his concubine, who brought forth for him a son, Ishmael, when he was eighty-six years old Gen 16 .
[64]  Thus, God would not fellowship with Abraham for thirteen years.
[65]  K. Saving His Wife from Abimelech, King of Gerar
[66]  Genesis 20 shows how God saved Abraham's wife from Abimelech, king of Gerar.
[67]  When God judged the evil world, God remembered His friend's talk with Him concerning Lot, even though they did not mention Lot.
[68]  SEEN IN HIS DEALINGS WITH ABRAHAM Scripture Reading: Exo 3:15; Acts 7:2; Gen 12:7; 17:1; 18:1 OUTLINE The God of Abraham Exo 3:15 seen in His dealings with Abraham as follows: The God of glory, in His first appearing with His first calling and His first speaking to Abraham, as the vast magnet and the great motivation to Abraham that moved him to come out of the country of satanic idolatry Gen 11:31; Acts 7:2-4a.
[69]  The God of blessing, in His second calling with His second speaking to Abraham, promising him that He would make of him a great country, make his name great, and make him a blessing to others, and that all the families of the earth would be blessed in him; this attracted Abraham to go into the good land of the divine promise Gen 12:1-4.
[70]  The God of comfort and encouragement, in His fourth speaking, after Lot left Abraham, in promising to give to Abraham and to his seed the land of Canaan as far as he could see in four directions, and to make his seed as numerous as the dust of the earth Gen 13:14-17.
[71]  The God of shield and great reward, in His fifth speaking this time in a vision to Abraham, when he was afraid of the four kings' avenging, in pointing to Abraham that his heavenly seed in their divine nature would be as many as the stars in heaven who could never be touched by anyone on earth; Abraham believed in Jehovah and Jehovah reckoned it to him for righteousness Gen 15:1-6.
[72]  The God of faithfulness, in foretelling to Abraham, in His sixth speaking to him in his deep sleep, that his earthly seed in their human nature would be sojourners in Egypt, serve the Egyptians, be afflicted by them for four hundred years, and in their fourth generation return to Canaan; and in making a covenant with him that He would give to his seed the land from the river of Egypt to the Great River, Euphrates Gen 15:12-21.
[73]  The God with His human friendship, in His coming in His fourth appearing with His eighth speaking to Abraham as a man, in the form of a man, to visit Abraham as His friend 2 Chron 20:7; Isa 41:8; James 2:23 on the level of humanity, with whom Abraham walked and who conversed with Abraham as a human friend with a human friend, concerning His judgment of Sodom, where His friend's nephew Lot and his family lived Gen 18 19.
[74]  In the previous message, we saw God's history in His working on Abraham.
[75]  In the Bible we cannot see another person whom God contacted, appeared to, and spoke to as much as Abraham.
[76]  God is revealed as the God of the earth, in His second appearing with His third speaking, in promising Abraham that He would give the land of Canaan to his seed Gen 12:6-7 .
[77]  The God of Abraham is seen as the God of secret care for His elect in saving Abraham from Pharaoh's insulting of his wife Gen 12:10-20 .
[78]  The God of Abraham is seen as the God Most High, the Possessor of heaven and earth, in His divine supply with His blessing to Abraham through His priest Melchisedec after Abraham fought the battle against the four kings Gen 14:17-20 .
[79]  God's justifying of Abraham meant that God became happy with Abraham and that Abraham was altogether in harmony with God.
[80]  Then God became silent to Abraham for thirteen years, until he became ninety-nine years old, and God appeared to him again Gen 17:1 .
[81]  When Abraham was ninety-nine years old, God came in to reconfirm His covenant, which became a covenant of circumcision Gen 17:9-14 .
[82]  In God's third appearing with His seventh speaking to Abraham, He is the God of all-sufficiency in being the God of circumcision to cut off His chosen people's natural man in the flesh that they may become God's new creation, signified by Isaac who was born by God's grace, not as Ishmael who was born by Abraham's flesh Gen 17:1-21; Gal 4:22-31 .
[83]  From this point God acted as a friend to Abraham.
[84]  God is also the God of changelessness in keeping the principle of His grace, in recognizing Isaac, Abraham's son of Sarah, as his only son, in His ninth speaking to Abraham Gen 21:1-12 .
[85]  Genesis 22:1-10 reveals the God with His trial, in proving Abraham, His intimate human friend, by asking him to present his only son, whom he loved, for a burnt offering to God, in His tenth speaking to Abraham.
[86]  Genesis 22:11-14 reveals the Triune God of provision, in His providing a ram to replace Isaac for a burnt offering to God as the Angel of Jehovah Christ .
[87]  The God of Abraham is seen as the God of friendship on the human level, in leading the old servant of His friend Abraham to secure a wife for his son Isaac Gen 24 .
[88]  As a whole, the God of Abraham is the God of speaking in appearing, with calling, in a vision, and in the human friendship, to unveil to His intimate friend on the earth what He aspired for him to be and what He wanted him to do according to His heart's desire for the accomplishment of the eternal economy for the Divine Trinity.
[89]  What God did was in His friendship with a human friend, but this was for the accomplishment of God's economy.
[90]  This is because God wanted this friend to have a seed and that seed is Christ, who is the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy.
[91]  On the morning of His resurrection the Lord Jesus told His disciples that He was ascending to His Father and our Father and to His God and our God John 20:17 .
[92]  We can never forget that, as the seed of Abraham, we have his God as our God, in whom we participate for our divine enjoyment, nor can we disregard that, as the members of Christ, we have His God as our God, who is our eternal portion in His eternal life.
[93]  In the previous message, we saw the God of Abraham in His dealings with Abraham.
[94]  God raised Isaac as the unique heir to Abraham to inherit God's promise to Abraham and God's covenant with Abraham Gen 17:19; 21:10-12; 26:3-4 .
[95]  Then Paul said in Galatians 3 that this seed of Abraham, not many seeds, is Christ v. 16 . Therefore, Isaac was a person who is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the one who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham Gen 22:17-18; Gal 3:16, 14 .
[96]  In like manner, Christ was offered to God for God's satisfaction, obeyed His Father even unto death, and was resurrected from death.
[97]  God appeared to Isaac again and promised as the God of Abraham to be with him, to bless him, and to multiply his seed for the sake of His servant Abraham 26:24-25 .
[98]  God destined Jacob to live a struggling life all his days.
[99]  He struggled with God, so God made him lame and changed his name to Israel, a prince of God.
[100]  To face the trouble of Laban's pursuing and overtaking him while he was under the secret care and protection of God as the Angel of God Christ 31:10-13 31:22-55.
[101]  To be purified with his family from the foreign gods and their ornaments which they loved, according to God's commandment, that they might serve God with an altar built at Bethel, where God changed his name from Jacob to Israel and promised him that: He as the all-sufficient God would make him fruitful and multiplied; a nation and a company of nations would be of him, and kings would come out of his loins.
[102]  In the previous messages, we saw God's working on Abraham and Isaac, and we began to see His working on Jacob with Joseph.
[103]  In order for us to understand the book of Genesis thoroughly, we have to know the life of Jacob even more than the life of Abraham.
[104]  After dealing with the trouble from his uncle, Jacob had to face the trouble of his brother Esau's dealing with him Gen 32:1-23; 33:1-17 .
[105]  Eventually, however, while Jacob was wrestling with God, God touched his thigh and made him limp 32:24-32 .
[106]  God did not allow Jacob to see his mother, but he had to take care of the funeral of his mother's nurse.
[107]  Eventually, near the end of his life, Jacob was released from all his sufferings to see his beloved son Joseph again in his honor and glory 45:1 47:12 and to enjoy a rich and peaceful life with the worship of God at his old age 47:11-12, 27-31 .
[108]  The complete Triune God of the three sections of the life of a corporate person: God the Father who loves man and chooses man, in the section of Jacob Mal 1:2; Rom 9:10-13.
[109]  God the Spirit who works in all things for the good of His lovers, transforms man, and makes man mature in the divine life that man may be able to bless all the people, to rule over all the earth, and to satisfy all the people with God the Son as the life supply, in the section of Jacob with Joseph Gen 27:41; 28:1 35:10; chs.
[110]  In this message we want to see the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[111]  In Exodus 3:15 this divine title was spoken by God Himself when He told Moses, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" cf. vv.
[112]  The book of Genesis reveals the complete Triune God of the three sections of the life of a corporate person.
[113]  In the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as a corporate person, we can see someone who was loved, chosen, called, and justified by God and made to enjoy all the riches of Christ.
[114]  Also this one was destined to live a struggling life, a suffering life.
[115]  When he was old, he knew only to bless people, to reign for God, and to distribute God as the life supply.
[116]  These three persons resulted in one people Israel Exo Mal .
[117]  This preparation was for bringing forth Christ the God-man, the complete God mingled with the perfect man Matt 1 .
[118]  Matthew 1 speaks of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham v. 1 . Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers v. 2 . Eventually, Jesus who is called Christ was born of Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph v. 16 . The God-man was brought forth for the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy.
[119]  The Triune God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy was initiated in Adam and issued in three persons Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[120]  The redeemed of God will be the tabernacle for the dwelling of God Rev 21:3 , and the redeeming God will be the temple for the dwelling of the redeemed v. 22 . This is for the expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in His nature and glory vv.
[121]  I. COMING DOWN TO DELIVER ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT A. Through Moses 1.
[122]  We have to remember that we are not merely studying the history of Israel but the history of God.
[123]  God delivered the children of Israel from the house of bondage 13:3, 14 by their eating the meat of the lamb with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs 12:8-11 .
[124]  God brought the children of Israel out of Egyptian tyranny and bondage into the wilderness Exo 3:18 .
[125]  Through the messages given in this series, we can see that the entire Bible is the history of God.
[126]  Genesis shows us God's history in His working through eight positive persons Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph.
[127]  The history of the Triune God in Genesis was initiated in Adam and issued in three persons Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[128]  From Exodus to Malachi is the history of God in one race, a particular race, a chosen race, the race of Israel.
[129]  He delivered Israel out of Egypt through Moses with ten plagues of miracles Exo 3:8, 14-20 , through the Passover 12:1-20 , through the Angel of Jehovah, Christ, with the pillar of cloud and of fire, the glory of God 14:19-20 , and through His mighty power to divide the Red Sea and destroy the Egyptian army 14:6-8, 21-31 .
[130]  On the evening of the feast of the Passover, they were charged to eat the lamb in haste with their loins girded, with shoes on their feet, and with a staff in their hand v.
[131]  It is very good to be saved by God out of the noisy world to a place where there is only the heavens and the earth and God, nothing else.
[132]  God quenched them with the living water 1 Cor 10:4a , typifying the overflowing Spirit John 7:37-39 , out of the cleft rock Exo 17:1-6 , typifying the crucified Christ John 19:34; 1 Cor 10:4b .
[133]  By bearing the nation of Israel through the wilderness, God brought them to Himself at Mount Sinai Exo 19:1-4 .
[134]  God redeemed them from their sins through the offerings typifying Christ John 1:29 .
[135]  Finally, they were able to meet God through the propitiatory blood on the propitiation cover of the ark typifying Christ as the center of God's dwelling Rom 3:25 in the Holy of Holies Exo 25:10-22; 37:1-9; 40:3, 20-21 .
[136]  The tabernacle is the embodiment of God, and related to this embodied God are six items: the laver to wash us, the brass altar to redeem us, the table to feed us, the lampstand to enlighten us, the incense altar to accept us, and the ark for us to stay with God to enjoy Him.
[137]  In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning God's working on His elect through Moses.
[138]  The entire book of Leviticus shows that God trained His elect to worship and partake of God and to live a holy, clean, and rejoicing life.
[139]  The history of God as seen in the books of Genesis and Exodus consummated in the children of Israel as a nation.
[140]  A part of the meal offering was to be burned on the altar to God as an offering by fire for food to God v. 2; Num 28:2, 8 . The rest of the meal offering was to be food to the priests Lev 2:3 . Thus, Christ as the meal offering is food to God and food to us, the New Testament priests.
[141]  The peace offering Lev 3:1-6 typifies Christ as the peace between God and His people for the enjoyment of God with His people in fellowship.
[142]  Leviticus reveals that we need to live a rejoicing life.
