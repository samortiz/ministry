   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PREPARATION FOR OUR MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to learn how to practice our meeting in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Christian meeting is an exhibition of the Christian daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to prepare ourselves for the meetings by praying, dealing with sins, being filled with the Spirit, and abiding in the fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to my learning and experience from the past, if we are going to meet according to the standard revealed in the Scriptures, we must be praying persons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A praying person is one who not only prays but who also has a praying spirit with a desire and an aspiration to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are this kind of person, then we are prepared to attend any kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we are intending to go to a meeting, we must spend some time to pray for at least five to ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have the time, we can pray for fifteen or twenty minutes, but we should not pray too long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A longer prayer can exhaust our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I walk for two hours, my legs will become tired.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, our spirit can become exhausted if we pray for too long a time before a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A proper member of a basketball team will always prepare himself for the game.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He must eat properly and make sure to get enough rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He also has to dress in the proper clothing for the game.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No one would come to play in a basketball game dressed like a bank clerk.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just before the game, the player participates in certain warm-up exercises so that he is fully prepared when the game begins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In like manner, we need to be prepared for the meetings that we attend.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of being prepared for the church meetings, many of the saints come to the meetings in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some even sleep in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a number of saints are sleeping in the meeting, that will deaden the entire meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even one person who is sleeping in the meeting can frustrate the speaking spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I am speaking and some of the saints are sleeping, my speaking spirit is deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would not stop the meeting and ask a sleeping one to leave, but I may forget my point when I see someone sleeping and become delayed in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we come to the meeting, we should come to the front as fighting soldiers to conquer the enemy and as prepared athletes to win the game.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are going to be prepared for the meetings, we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I sympathize with the saints who are so busy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am a very busy person, but I always pray before I speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all need such a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must learn to get ourselves prepared to speak in the meetings by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we pray, the Lord will show us all of our faults, shortcomings, failures, defeats, wrongdoings, and mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must deal with our sins by confessing them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to make a thorough confession of all our trespasses and offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we would deal with our sins thoroughly, we will enjoy the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be filled with the Holy Spirit is so normal, yet it is altogether miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a miraculous normality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we pray and make a thorough confession of all our sins, we will spontaneously enjoy the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We realize that we are filled with the Spirit by faith, not by our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once you have prayed and dealt with your sins to be filled with the Holy Spirit, you must learn to abide in the fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you have prayed, dealt with your sins, and are ready to come to the meeting, it is best not to receive a phone call.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes one short phone call can deaden you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The enemy tries to frustrate us either from coming to the meeting or from coming to the meeting in a prepared state.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you do not have a meeting on a particular evening, no one may call you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when you have a meeting, a phone call may come just before you leave for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to my experience, most of these phone calls are calls with bad news.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This bad news can kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is also helpful to be careful about when you open your mail on a meeting night.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your wife may have received the mail at noon, but she forgot to tell you about a letter for you until you are ready to go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is best for you to put this mail aside until after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Tell Satan, Satan, you better read the mail.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not my business now.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I ll come back after the meeting and read the mail.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many times the mail that is given to us right before the meeting has bad news to bother and frustrate us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The husbands even have to be exercised in how they deal with their wives before the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We all need to be wise by redeeming our time to keep ourselves in a good condition to attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope we see that attending the meetings of the church is not a light and easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For the sake of the meetings, we must learn to abide in the fellowship with the Lord.</S>
