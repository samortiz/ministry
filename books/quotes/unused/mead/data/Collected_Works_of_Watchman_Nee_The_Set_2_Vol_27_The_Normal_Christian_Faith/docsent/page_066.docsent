   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MUTUAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to realize that the life we received is perfect but not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has not given us a complete life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our life is one that depends on other lives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life we received from Christ is a mutual life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not independent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have to rely on you, and you have to rely on me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot live without each other.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we need the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some institutions in the world have their attached departments, and some colleges have attached schools.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same sense, we Christians are attached one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We live by attaching to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the first day on we have to learn not to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to be part of the church and live with other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, to come into the church does not mean to be converted from being an unbeliever to a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It means that those who are already Christians should not be independent; rather, they should be related to others in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>NOT AN EASY MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of which church then should we be a part?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the old days, this was not a big problem because there was only one church in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But today the matter has become very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Presently, merely the organized and sizable denominations number at least fifteen hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In some cities you can easily name a hundred organizations that call themselves a church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a Christian it is not easy to choose one out of the fifteen hundred without being somewhat swayed by others' influence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE WORD OF GOD GIVES THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Due to the confusion, the problem of identifying oneself with a church is a very difficult one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet if you would go according to the Word of God and look at the matter from the biblical point of view, there is still a way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Word of God has a clear revelation concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It shows us clearly of which church we should be a part.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we have to know a little more about the divisions in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only then will we know what God is after.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we have the discernment, we will know which church is according to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>CAUSES OF DIVISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The causes of the present confusion and divisions among churches can be summarized into the following categories:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1 Groups are denominated according to geographical reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Anglican or Episcopal Church is one example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anglican means it belongs to the Anglos.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When it was carried over to America, it was called the Episcopal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But it was in reality still the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When it was brought to China, it became the Church of England in China.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And when the Episcopal Church also came to China, it became the Church of England in America in China!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Take the example of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is in reality the Church of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When it came to China, it established churches in Shanghai and Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now Rome is mixed up with Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many denominations that originate according to geographical reasons confuse the churches throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2 Confusion may arise out of the difference in time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, when Catholicism was introduced in China during the Tang dynasty, it was called Nestorianism.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then during the Ming dynasty, a new wave came in distinct from the former Nestorians.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During the Ching dynasty, all kinds of sects and denominations started to flow in. None of them were related in any way to the former two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When they all came to Shanghai, the time lapse between their establishments had produced a host of different churches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>3 Churches may be divided according to people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The group that Mr. John Wesley started eventually became the Methodist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It has its independent organization and administration and has branches all over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then there is the Lutheran denomination, which was formed after the death of Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now Lutheran churches appear all over the world also.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All these divisions are divided according to men.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are many other organizations that denominate themselves in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>4 There may be a difference in the emphasis of truths.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who emphasize justification by faith set up the Lutheran Church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who look to Pentecostal experiences started the Pentecostal churches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And those who believe in immersion, as opposed to sprinkling for baptism, formed the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some groups emphasize church administration.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who believe in the independence of jurisdiction formed the Congregational churches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who proposed the order of eldership started the Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who emphasize apostolic succession began the Apostolic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, all these fifteen hundred denominations were formed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every group has its history and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you merely listen to their history or doctrines, it is very difficult to find the way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today if you are in Shanghai or in Foochow, it is a hard thing for you to decide which church you should join.</S>
