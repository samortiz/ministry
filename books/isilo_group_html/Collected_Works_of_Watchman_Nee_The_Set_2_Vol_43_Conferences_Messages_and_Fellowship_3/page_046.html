God's goal is with the flesh because God's life is with the flesh. When we believe and are saved, we can come to God immediately because we are begotten by Him and share His life. Whether or not we will receive glory and reward depends on whether we allow God's life to live within us. Romans 3:23 tells us that all men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. When man sins, he cannot come to God. What is God's glory? It is God Himself, His dwelling and His manifestation. The God of glory dwells in glory. All men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. As a result they cannot dwell with God. Colossians 1:27 says, "Christ in you, the hope of glory." A sinner cannot come to God. But when we have the Lord inside of us, we have the hope of glory.</p><p>Christ in us is God's goal. Hebrews 2:10 says, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory." God's goal is to bring many sons into glory. What do the words "through whom" and "for whom" mean? All things being through Him means that all things came out of Him, and all things being for Him means that all things belong to Him. All things came from God, and all things will return to God. The One for whom are all things and through whom are all things is God. What is God's goal? His goal is to bring many sons into glory. Hence, His goal is first to have many sons and second to bring these many sons into glory. It was fitting for the Author of their salvation to be made perfect through sufferings. This verse is easy to understand, and we need no further explanation.</p><p>Verse 11 speaks of the sanctifying One. Who can sanctify men? Christ can. Who are the sanctified ones? The Christians are. He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One. Both Christ and the church are all of One. This One is God. Christ came from God, so does the church. The church comes from God and receives its life from God. Hence, the church, which is sanctified through Christ and produced through the life of Christ, is from God and of God. This is why Christ is not ashamed to call the sanctified ones brothers. Christ can call us brothers because both Christ and we come from God. God's goal is for Christ to call men His brothers. God's goal is for Christ to have many brothers and for Him to have many sons.</p><p>We have to see the fullness of His salvation; man's sins are forgiven by His blood, and the old man has been crucified by the cross. Furthermore, God has put His flesh within man to be man's new life. Many people have this life within them, but it has not yet become their life. This is why they continue to be weak and defeated. The death of Christ accomplished the aspect of God's work related to the flesh; He has put His life into the flesh so that we can now receive God's life when we eat His flesh. The Lord's blood delivers us from death, while His flesh gives us life. These two things are entirely different. In the eyes of God, man should die, but the Lord shed His blood on our behalf. As a result man no longer needs to die. Hence, he is delivered from death through the blood. But man still does not have life. Eating the flesh brings life to man. The blood is on the negative side, and the flesh is on the positive side. All the works of Christ are ours when we exercise our living faith. If we have a living faith, Christ's life will become our life.</p><p>John 6:47-58 begins with, "He who believes has eternal life." In the original language, "eternal life" means a life of eternity. God's life is a life of eternity. Those who believe will have eternal life, that is, the life of God. The "eternal life" spoken of in the Gospel of John does not refer to the believers' living forever; it refers to the life of eternity. The Lord says that he who believes will have eternal life. This means that he who believes will have the life of God.</p><p>The Lord also said that if a man eats the bread that comes down out of heaven, he will live forever. The Lord's flesh is the bread out of heaven, and those who eat His flesh will have eternal life. This is the word of the Lord. His flesh is given for the life of the world. This word is not directed at sinners. A sinner should die; therefore, his need is deliverance from death. The world, that is, humankind, is composed of men created by God. Created men only have the created life; they do not have the life of God. The Lord gives created men the bread out of heaven, and those who eat this bread will have the life of God. This bread is the Lord's flesh. Hence, we have to pay as much attention to Christ's flesh as we do to His blood. I hope we will not be as we were before, paying too much attention to the blood while neglecting the flesh. The Lord Himself paid much attention to the flesh. He said that His flesh is given to be our life. The Jews did not understand this, and they asked, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat?" (v. 52). The Lord said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves" (v. 53). In this verse the Lord spoke of the flesh first and the blood afterwards.</p><p>Hebrews 2:14 says, "Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same." In this verse, the blood is spoken of before the flesh. But in the original language, the flesh is spoken of before the blood. God cares very much about the order. The words in the Bible are not chosen at random. They show us that God pays a great deal of attention to the flesh.</p><p>The Lord said that unless we eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, we have no life within ourselves (John 6:53). The flesh is related to life. A man receives life through eating the flesh. Of course, he cannot receive life unless his sins are first washed away. If the problem of sin is not settled, no one can have Christ living in him. In verse 53 the Lord spoke of the flesh first in order to show us that we cannot have His life without eating the flesh. He spoke of the blood second in order to show us that we cannot eat the flesh without the remedial redemption of the blood. In verses 51 and 52 only the flesh is spoken of. Then in verse 53 the flesh is spoken of before the blood. This shows us that the significance of the flesh is primary, whereas the significance of the blood is secondary.</p><p>Why will believers resurrect at the Lord's coming but unbelievers only resurrect at the great white throne? This is because Christians have the life of Christ. Those who have life will enter into life when the Lord returns. As soon as Christians hear the Lord's cry, they will rise up. Those who have life will enter into God's glory, but those who do not believe will enter into eternal death (John 5:28-29). The believers who have died and are buried in the ground will rise up that day and be resurrected into life and glory. The dead ones in the world will not rise up, because they do not have life. We have the flesh in us, and we have the blood, and on that day we will rise up to be with our God.</p><p>The Lord said that His flesh is true bread. How can His flesh be our bread? His word cannot be wrong. When He says that His flesh is our true bread, it means that it is our true bread. In John 6 the Lord mentioned the flesh before the blood four times (vv. 53-56). In the two instances in which the flesh and the blood are not mentioned together, only the flesh is mentioned (vv. 51-52). These verses show that the flesh is more important than the blood. By the blood we are delivered from death, and by eating the flesh we receive life. Those who have life abide in Him and He in them. In this way we become one spirit with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS LIFE<br />THROUGH A LIVING FAITH</h2><p>Many people are in Christ. But they do not have any experience of Him, because they do not have a living faith. If we receive Him with a living faith, we will see that we are not only in Christ but that Christ is also in us as our power, life, and everything. The proper place for a light bulb is on the lampstand. It should be connected to the power plant through the power lines. It must be joined to the source of electricity and receive the current of electricity before it will shine. Only when we are in Christ, will His life, power, light, etc., flow into us.</p><p>While we say that we eat the flesh, we should not say that we eat the blood. We cannot eat the blood; we can only drink the blood. In verses 51 and 52 the Lord did not speak of drinking at all. This shows that His attention was on eating, not on drinking. Eating the Lord's flesh is eating the Lord. The flesh represents Him. If we eat His flesh, we will live forever; otherwise, we will die.</p><p>Christ presents Himself to us in these verses to show us that without receiving Him as life, we cannot satisfy God's demand and cannot reach God's goal. Outwardly speaking, we are living on this earth. But actually we are like dead persons. May the Lord be gracious to us. May He open our eyes to see that we have not only the blood, the crucifixion, but also the flesh. These different aspects of the truth are not the same. May the Lord be merciful to us and grant us a clear revelation of these things.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
