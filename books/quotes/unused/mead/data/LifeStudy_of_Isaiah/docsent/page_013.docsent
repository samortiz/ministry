   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jehovah took away from Jerusalem and from Judah every kind of support all the support of bread and all the support of water 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He also took away from them all the leaders, such as the judge, the prophet, and the elder, leaving them no rulers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The people were then oppressed each by the other, and no one was willing to be the leader, because of the shortage of bread and clothing vv.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As part of His chastisement of His people, God took away from them all their leaders, leaving them with no rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To have no ruler is God's chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a family does not have a ruler, that family will be in chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In such a family there would be neither father nor mother, neither elder brother nor elder sister.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one would be able to exercise any ruling, and the family would be in a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, if in a church there were no leading ones, that church would be in chaos.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ruling and feeding go together as a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ruling produces feeding, and feeding issues in ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a church is well nourished, there surely must be proper ruling in that church.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, if there is feeding, there is ruling; and if there is ruling, there is feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When there is the proper feeding in the church life, everything will be in order.</S>
