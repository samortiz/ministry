   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR BEING TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE IMAGE OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FROM GLORY TO GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AS FROM THE LORD SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BY BEHOLDING AND REFLECTING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>HIS GLORY WITH UNVEILED FACE 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:16-18</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 3:18 Paul says, And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that, as a pattern of a person who lives Christ for the church, Paul was daily experiencing transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Transformation in 3:18, a metabolic change, is from glory to glory, that is, from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We covered these matters in the previous message.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message we shall consider how to be transformed from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BEHOLDING AND REFLECTING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the title of this message indicates, we are transformed by beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are transformed not only by seeing the Lord, but also by reflecting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A mirror has the capacity both to behold an object and to reflect it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The English words beholding and reflecting as a mirror are the translation of a single word in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The use of this word in 3:18 is metaphorical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, a mirror beholds a person or an object.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, a mirror reflects what it beholds.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are the two aspects of the function of a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever you stand before a mirror, that mirror beholds you and also reflects you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the mirror functions in these two aspects, you can see yourself in it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>OUR NEED TO BE UNVEILED</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our experience we all should be mirrors looking at the Lord and reflecting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if we would be mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, we must not have any veils over us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose a mirror is proper in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is in the right position with respect to the object it is to behold and reflect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the mirror is covered with a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as a mirror is covered with cloth, veiled, it loses its function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The veil keeps the mirror both from beholding and from reflecting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, if we are veiled, we cannot behold and reflect the Lord s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, all the veils are removed, we shall be mirrors beholding and reflecting Him with unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a mirror, are you veiled or unveiled?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are veiled, you may call on the name of the Lord and still not behold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would behold and reflect the Lord, all the veils must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every one of us needs to be fully unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>VEILED BY RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christians cannot behold and reflect the Lord because they are covered by a thick veil or perhaps several layers of veils.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider how many people there are in today s Catholicism, and how many have been veiled by the influence of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose there were no such thing as Catholicism and all those in Catholicism were unbelievers who did not know anything about God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How much easier it would be to preach the gospel to them and bring them to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many would be quick to receive and understand spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if you try to speak to those in Catholicism concerning God s New Testament economy, you will discover that the majority are veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, it is extremely difficult for them to see the things of Christ in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A particular brother in the Lord s recovery was raised a Catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a child he even served as an altar boy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when he was in high school, he received the Lord Jesus into him and was genuinely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Happy and very excited, he told others of his experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said, Now I have the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But one of his relatives pointed to an image of Jesus on the wall and replied that they already had Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be sure, that person was covered by a thick veil!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I use this as an illustration of the fact that religion has caused a great number of people to be veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These veils keep them from seeing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those without a religious background often find it easier to enter into the truths of the New Testament than those who were raised in either Catholicism or Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nevertheless, even those without a religious background may still be under the influence of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even before certain ones became Christians, they had some concept concerning the way people worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They may already have the thought that in a Christian service of worship there is a pastor who does certain things and that the congregation will pray or sing in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even those who are not Christians are affected or influenced by religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These concepts can be veils.</S>
