We should send them back to the places from which they came. Recently I heard certain ones complaining that they spend much labor to gain people, and they send them to the training for four terms at a great cost, but eventually the trainees do not come back. They are retained in Anaheim. We should not convince the trainees to stay in Anaheim after their four terms. This is to be ambitious, to get people for our work and not for the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I am not for this. I am for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The training I set up has the intention to train people from all the nations. I have strongly said that all the foreigners should go back to their country after being trained. A number of trainees from New Zealand wanted to stay, but I encouraged them to go back to New Zealand. Some like to keep more people on the campuses in Southern California, but what about the campuses in other countries? Something wrong is hidden here, and some have complained about it. Do not think that I have the intention to keep the trainees here. If I have such a concept, I should be condemned. This would mean that I am ambitious to get all the best ones to come to Anaheim.</p><p>Be careful; do not keep people for your campus. The enemy does things subtly, so the Lord says, &ldquo;Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation&rdquo; (Matt. 26:41). We are short of watching and praying, so the subtle one has come in to deceive us. Some like to keep the good ones in their own city, and they complain that the training assigns too many good ones to the other cities. You may say, &ldquo;We are keeping the trainees so that we can gain more people.&rdquo; However, to the Lord every place is the same. Whether He gains people in one place or in another is the same. Why do you want to keep people in your place? It is simply for yourself. This is ambition; it is something hidden. Do not think that I do not love the church in your place. My heart is for the recovery, and by &ldquo;the recovery&rdquo; I mean the Lord&rsquo;s move on the whole earth. I am for the churches, not merely for one church. Therefore, when I see these things, my heart aches.</p><p>You must learn to condemn and reject your self to the uttermost and simply take care of the Lord&rsquo;s interest, of His recovery, and not your work. Then the Lord will honor you. You do not need to go out to advertise. To the Lord money does not mean anything. If we afford Him a way, He will provide. After the Gulf War in 1991, we were ready to afford the Lord a way for His move in Russia, so right away He put His blessing upon us. Where did the saints come from who went to Russia? Many simply wanted to go. This was the Lord&rsquo;s doing; it was not my doing. I did not go out to convince anyone to give, to go, or to pray, but many prayers were poured out for this move. Now we can see the result. Thousands of the leading cities in Russia, some with over one million people, have been reached by our publications. I have read some of the responses of the Russian people. They ask for more books by Brother Nee and myself. They realize that we are one, and they do not want others&rsquo; writings. As of this time we have sent seventy Americans and sixty Chinese, and about seventy Russians have been raised up locally and trained to serve with their full time. This is the result of the Lord&rsquo;s move, not the result of my work. I am not able to do this much. The Lord has done it.</p><p>I have received many letters to which I did not reply, because I knew your concern was merely for your district. This is for your work, and I am not for that. The Lord is spreading widely throughout the world and around the globe. Therefore, I would like to see that all of you are for the concern of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, not for the work in your district.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
