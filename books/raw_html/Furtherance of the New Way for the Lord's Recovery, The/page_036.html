<h2 class=head2>Bringing the New Ones into the Church Life</h2><p>When we go out to lead the home meetings, teach the truth to the new ones, and lead them to grow in life, there will be a necessary process. The working out of this process will not be uniform; some new ones will learn a little faster, while others will go somewhat more slowly. For example, some will be eager to learn what the church is, so we should take advantage of the opportunity to stir up their love for the Lord and the church and bring them to the church meetings. We must, however, pay attention to the matter of bringing them to the appropriate meetings. Otherwise, not only will we be unable to help them, but we may even damage them. This is why we say that the local churches must coordinate in the matter of the meetings by making them living, fresh, and full of supply. Other new ones may be reluctant to leave the home meetings and may even be unwilling to meet in the homes of other people. Concerning these ones, we should still spend time to care for them, feeding and supplying them wisely until we can bring them out of their homes.<p>The local churches are not perfect. Although it seems that we are entrusting the elders of the church in Taipei with the responsibility of the success or failure of the new way, actually it is the responsibility of the elders in all the local churches also. The reason Paul wrote so many epistles to so many local churches, such as the church in Rome, the church in Corinth, and the church in Ephesus, was that every local church needed perfecting. The saints leading the home meetings also need the wisdom to determine the situation of the new ones; if they are mature, they should be brought to attend the appropriate church meetings. This requires us to have much learning.<h2 class=head2>Forming the Home Meetings into Group Meetings and Eventually Leading the New Ones to the Lord’s Day Meetings</h2><p>During this time of transition, if we are faithful, the home meetings can be formed—not formally or organizationally, but spontaneously—into group meetings. For example, according to the practical situation, you may ask several neighboring homes which are under your care to gather together and have a small group meeting every once in awhile. This can be likened to piling burning coals together: the more you pile them up, the brighter the fire burns. These three to five homes which come together will slowly get to know one another, and as they become familiar with each other, they will gradually learn to like one another. Then they will be able to stir up their love and encourage one another. We should not allow the new ones to remain just in the home meetings, or we will be like mothers who keep their children at home and do not let them leave to get an education. This makes it very difficult for them to grow well. The goal of leading the home meetings is to bring a few homes together to gradually make them a group meeting and ultimately to bring the new ones into the church so that they may have a proper church life. Thus, the church meetings must be living, fresh, rich, moving, and full of supply so that the saints will feel confident that they can bring the new ones.<h2 class=head1>FURTHERING THE LORD’S RECOVERY BY PRACTICING THE NEW WAY</h2><p>According to the statistics, the rate of increase in Christianity over the past twenty years has been very low, while the rate of increase for other religions like Buddhism or Islam has been very high. The reason is that the system in Christianity is wrong, because all the believers do nothing with the hired pastors doing everything for them. This kind of practice cannot cause the believers to live and grow; instead, it kills them and nullifies their organic function. One of the earliest Christian denominations which came to Taiwan was the Scottish Presbyterian Church; it has a history of over one hundred years here, but at present they have only a little over 100,000 members. The local churches are next with only forty or fifty thousand; the third is the True Jesus Church with twenty or thirty thousand. These three added together make only about 200,000, so when we include the other Christian groups, the total number of Christians in Taiwan is only about 500,000. This fact is very disappointing.<p>Not only has the situation in Christianity become disheartening; even the so-called churches in the Lord’s recovery have fallen and gone backwards into a condition that is about the same as that of Christianity. In 1949 we began the work in Taiwan, and in the first four or five years the numbers kept increasing from four or five hundred all the way up to 40,000 or 50,000. After almost forty years, the present number is still about 40,000 or 50,000. What is the reason for this? It must be that the practice of having big meetings in which one person speaks and everyone else listens is killing the organic function of the saints while at the same time it is killing the increase and spread of the churches.<p>However, due to God’s faithfulness, we are not discouraged, and within us there is a long-range view that home meeting after home meeting will be raised up until each home meeting is full of vitality and everyone—male, female, young, and old—can speak, sing, and function. We must accomplish this in the shortest time possible, so that every home meeting will be living and functioning. Then when we go out door-knocking to preach the gospel, we will bring people to salvation without having to rely on preachers. Instead, household after household will go out, and one household will perfect another household. Then the rate of increase will be extremely high.<p>It may be that we all are accustomed to the big meetings and big façades. The older saints especially think it is very good to come to a big meeting and see at least three hundred or five hundred people sitting there with at least one person who knows how to preach. They wonder why it is necessary to break these big meetings up into meetings of only three or five people in which everyone must speak and take the lead even if they do not know how to do these things. In their opinion these meetings are not very orderly or beautiful. However, the Lord is not interested in a façade. He only cares whether or not His children are functioning. If we can lead 20,000 home meetings with 50,000 or 60,000 new ones, it will be very easy for them to go out door-knocking. Today the neighborhoods are all composed of high-rise buildings. If the Lord has mercy on us, we can get ten percent of the households in every high-rise building to be saved. Then they can go out door-knocking and preach the gospel to the other ninety percent of the families. It would be so easy because they would all know one another. This is not being idealistic. Rather, this is a practical, long-range view set before us. May the Lord have mercy on us that we would be able to carry out this long-range view and testify that this is the Lord’s recovery and the Lord’s church.<p>This does not mean, however, that the big meetings do not have their function. Actually, for the enjoyment of the riches of the Body, we need to have combined meetings of the entire church at least six times a year, two of which should be the graduation meetings of the full-time training. Then we should have some joyful gatherings as feasts once every three months.
