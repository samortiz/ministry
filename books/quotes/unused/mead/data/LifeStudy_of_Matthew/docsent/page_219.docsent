   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY A LAWYER OF THE PHARISEES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Pharisees learned that the Lord had silenced the Sadducees, they held a council about what to do next.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then one of them, a lawyer, tempted the Lord by asking Him a question about the great commandment in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A lawyer was one versed in the law of Moses, a professional interpreter of the law of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord said that the great and first commandment was to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, and mind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then He continued, And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two commandments are both a matter of love, either loving God or loving man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Love is the spirit of God s commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In all these tests the Lord Jesus was questioned regarding four things: religion, politics, belief, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Regarding religion, He was questioned concerning the source of authority in religious activities.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regarding politics, He was asked about paying tribute to the Roman government.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regarding belief, He was questioned about the belief in the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regarding the law, He was asked which was the great commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From all four directions those who tested the Lord Jesus were muzzled and had nothing more to say.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>MUZZLING ALL THE TESTERS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BY THE QUESTION OF QUESTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After He had been questioned, the Lord had a question for the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 41 and 42 say, Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying, What do you think concerning the Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whose Son is He?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From 21:23 to 22:46, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, Christ was surrounded by the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, Sadducees, and a lawyer, who endeavored to ensnare Him by asking puzzling and crafty questions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Firstly, the chief priests, representing the authority of the Jewish religion, and the elders, representing the authority of the Jewish people, asked Him concerning His authority 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was a question according to their religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Secondly, the fundamental Pharisees and political Herodians asked Him a question related to politics.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thirdly, the modernistic Sadducees questioned Him concerning the fundamental belief.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Fourthly, a self-qualified lawyer asked Him a question concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them a question concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the question of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their questions were related to religion, politics, belief, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His question was concerning Christ, who is the center of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They knew religion, politics, belief, and the law, but they paid no attention to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, He asked them, What do you think concerning the Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This question of questions must be answered by everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>People today have many questions, but all their questions can be classified into the four categories of religion, politics, belief, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as in ancient times, people today care for these things, not for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They simply have no concept concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But God s concern is for Christ, and Christ s concern is for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence He asks, What do you think about Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whose Son is He?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This question touches Christ s Person, which is a mystery, the most perplexing matter in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christology is the study of the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the second century onward, Christian teachers have been fighting with one another concerning Christology.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today the battle between us and the opposers is also related to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, one of the leading opposers teaches that Christ is not in us, but is merely represented in us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to him, Christ is at the right hand of God in the third heaven, and the Holy Spirit represents Him in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This concept is related to tritheism, the teaching that the three of the Godhead are separate individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who teach that Christ is merely represented in us by the Holy Spirit actually have three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Deep within, many fundamental Christians subconsciously have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Recently, some opposers have said that Christ s divinity is in the believers, but His humanity is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How ridiculous!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now some not only have three Gods, but two Christs, a material Christ and a spiritual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such peculiar concepts are the issue of our fallen mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What a dreadful thing to separate Christ s humanity from His divinity!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This illustrates the fact that the question regarding Christ is still the question of questions today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the Pharisees were asked this question by the Lord, they replied that Christ was David s son v. 42 . No doubt, according to the Scriptures, this answer was correct.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then the Lord said, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said to My Lord, Sit on My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his Son? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>43-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The question here is how a great-grandfather could call his great-grandson Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was one question the Pharisees did not know how to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As God, in His divinity, Christ is the Lord of David; as a man, in His humanity, He is the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Pharisees had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ s Person, that He was the Son of David according to His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They did not have the other half, concerning Christ s divinity as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The mention of the spirit in verse 43 indicates that Christ is only known by us in our spirit through God s revelation Eph 3:5, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>. Verse 46 says, And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him any more.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ s question of questions concerning His wonderful Person muzzled the mouths of all His opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Pharisees had studied the Old Testament, and they had seen clearly that Christ was to be the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But they did not see that Christ was also the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even those who have admitted that Christ is both the Son of God and the Son of David have argued whether His two natures were separate or mingled.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead of arguing about Christ s Person, we should say, Hallelujah, we have a Person who is glorious and mysterious!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is so wonderful that we cannot adequately understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Consider Isaiah 9:6: For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It will take eternity for us to understand this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ is a child, yet He is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is the Son, yet He is called the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do not think that we can understand Christ adequately today.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No, He is too wonderful and too far beyond our comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We do not even fully understand ourselves, much less Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do you know where your spirit is, or where your soul is?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Can you locate your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The more you analyze yourself, the more you will find yourself in a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When I was very young, I thought I knew myself thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But the longer I have lived, the more I realize how little I know.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we cannot understand ourselves, how can we adequately understand Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How wonderful Christ is!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is both God and man, both the Son of God and the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Furthermore, He is both in the heavens and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He is inside and outside; He is on the top and on the bottom; He is the greatest and the smallest.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Oh, Christ is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We need to know Him to such a degree.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then we shall say, Lord Jesus, I cannot exhaust the knowledge of You.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Lord, You are the only worthy One.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If there is a God, this God must be You.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If there is a genuine human being, this person must be You.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Lord, You are the Savior, the Redeemer, the life, and the light.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We today must come to know how inexhaustible the Lord Jesus is as the Son of David and the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Both the experience of Him and the knowledge of Him are inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Because Christ is the all-inclusive One, the enjoyment of Him is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Do not be led into the devilish snare of debate concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Thinking you know everything concerning Christ s Person is an indication that you have been snared already.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Although we can know Christ, we cannot understand Him thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We know that Jesus Christ is the Son and that He is also called the Father, for the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But we cannot comprehend this adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We also know that Christ is the Son of God and the Son of man and that He has both the divine nature and the human nature in one Person.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Thus, He is one Person with two natures and two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>However, it is beyond our ability to understand this thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We simply believe whatever the Bible says and praise Him for being so wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We need to worship Him, take Him in, enjoy Him, and experience Him as the wonderful One.</S>
