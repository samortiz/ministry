Although the Hebrew believers also suffered some shame and endured the cross, they had not yet resisted unto blood
We can expect many trials and tribulations, but what is the purpose and meaning behind all these trials and tribulations?
He said that if the Lord disciplines us, we must not regard it lightly; and if the Lord reproves us, we must not faint
As Christians they feel that they have suffered too much hardship in their environment and that it is too hard to live the Christian life
Their thought is on entering the pearly gates and walking on a golden street wearing fine, white linen garments
Many children of God have been Christians for eight or ten years, yet they have never given serious consideration to God's discipline
The first thing we should do when we experience something is to find the meaning of our experience: Why have things happened this way?
It is to say that God can do whatever He wants to do and that we must simply go through these experiences mindlessly and aimlessly
If the Christian life became nothing but a story of suffering and frustration, it would be too much of a discouragement to us
We must learn to accept the discipline of the Lord and to see that His discipline and reproach are always meaningful
God has no time to discipline everyone in the world, but He disciplines His own children because He loves them
He will train his son according to a few objectives, namely, honesty, diligence, long-suffering, and noble aspirations
At the very beginning of his Christian life, a child of God must realize that God has prepared many lessons for him
He wants to build up a certain kind of character in us, and He does it by ordering all kinds of circumstances to come our way
They walk according to their own will and wander in a wild, unrestrained, and aimless way through the wilderness
In verse 7 the apostle explains the quotation from Proverbs in verses 5 and 6, saying, 'It is for discipline that you endure'
What are the discipline and scourging in verses 5 and 6 and what are the shame affliction and resistance against sin in verses 2 through 4
Although our resistance against sin is not unto blood, the pain and tribulation are nevertheless part of God's discipline
We see a big contrast when a person understands that what is happening to him is of God; he will have a different view toward his experience
Verse 8 says, 'But if you are without discipline, of which all sons have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons'
Those who are without discipline are illegitimate; they belong to other families and are not members of the household of God
When the mother of three of the children came, she spanked her children on their hands and forbade them to dirty themselves again
Because we are sons, there is discipline; since there is discipline, there must also be submission on our part
We may think that we have nothing to obey, but when God disciplines us a little, we immediately think of ways of escape
Often parents discipline their children in a poor way, because they act and discipline according to their own whims
No discipline or reproach of God is merely a punishment; it is educational in nature, and it is there for our profit
May the Lord be merciful to us so that His discipline, whenever it is upon us, may produce a little more holiness
After we accept the Lord and become God's children, He daily arranges many things in our environment to discipline and chastise us
If we neglect God's discipline, and if it does not produce the needed effect in us, our loss will be an eternal loss indeed!
God not only gives us His holiness as a gift, but He also wants us to partake of His holiness through His discipline
Carnal persons like us require years of discipline from God before His holy character and nature can become ours
We need all kinds of blows, situations, guidance, frustrations, urgings, and chastisement before we can partake of God's holy character
If a person brews liquor from grapes or other kinds of fruit, the wine surfaces to the top, while the lees settle to the bottom
A brother may experience God's uprooting through his consecration; everything that he owns may be completely uprooted
A brother may experience God's uprooting through his sufferings and trials; he may be stripped of everything he has
God disciplines us and deals with us in many ways so that we may lose our original smell and yield the peaceable fruit
The peaceable fruit of righteousness can be translated as 'the peaceable fruit, which is the fruit of righteousness'
The hands may hang down and the knees may be paralyzed, but there is the fruit of peace and the fruit of righteousness
After we are disciplined and scourged, we need to set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees
If a person goes through trials and humbles himself under God's mighty hand, he will find his character constituted with holiness
