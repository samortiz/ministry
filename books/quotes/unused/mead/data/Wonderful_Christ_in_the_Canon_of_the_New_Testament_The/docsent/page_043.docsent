   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Acts 1:5, 8; 2:4, 17a, 21, 33, 38; 10:44-47; 11:15-16; 1 Cor 12:12-14; Gal 3:27-28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that with Christ first of all there is the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following this we have the crucifixion, resurrection, and then the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the ascension, we have the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Incarnation brings God into man, mingling divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The crucifixion terminates and ends every negative thing: sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, the self, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All negative things have been fully terminated on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The cross was the end of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Crucifixion was followed by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Resurrection is the germination of a new start that we may have new life and be in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After this Christ was exalted to the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This exaltation was a kind of inauguration to put Jesus into His office.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was positioned, authorized, and inaugurated into His post to carry out God s project of building God s eternal dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today this is the church, and ultimately it will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His ascension He has been qualified, approved, appointed, and even committed with the divine life, the Holy Spirit, and all the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now this ascended Christ has all the items that are necessary for the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A BIG MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first step the Lord took to accomplish God s project was to baptize all His members in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These were all the people which God had chosen and predestinated in eternity past to be given to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He baptized all of them into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was the baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we have a big mystery, and this is why among Christian teachers there are different opinions, interpretations, understandings, and practices concerning the matter of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament there are a few mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The person of Christ is one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the Son, the Father Isa 9:6 , and the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is according to the pure revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have no doubt that Jesus is God incarnated; He did become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all have to confess that Jesus did come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was God as well as man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the expression of God, He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet Isaiah 9:6 says, For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Son given to us is called the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why He is so mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But this is in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the New Testament says in 2 Corinthians 3:17, Now the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the Son, yet He is called the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the Lord, yet the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus is altogether a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not try to understand Him by our limited mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can we understand the mysterious Jesus when we cannot even understand ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you know that you have two hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One heart is the physical heart, and the other is the psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our physical heart may be quite perfect, but our psychological heart is corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Can you tell where this psychological heart is in your being?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot even understand ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then how can we understand the wonderful Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The person of Christ is a real mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE MYSTERY OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the New Testament there is another mystery the matter of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is one, yet He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How can you define Him?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I was a young Christian, I tried to understand the trinity of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the more I tried, the more I could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Triune God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three persons of one God is just a kind of interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This should not be pressed too far; otherwise it will lead to three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many Christian teachers do hold the concept that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three Gods, but they dare not to express this in words openly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some say that the Father, who has a person, is one God, and the Son, who also has a person, is another God, but the Spirit, who does not have a person, is merely an influence, not another God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All these concepts with their interpretations are complicated and complicating.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not get involved with them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot understand the mystery of the Triune God adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can and should only believe the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Matthew 28:19 speaks of the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is one name for the Father, Son, and Spirit, because God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ, God, and the Spirit are the one Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We cannot tell how God could be triune, but according to the Bible we do know that He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to forget about the theological terminology, but take care of the pure Word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How could one God be the Father, the Son, and the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why His name is called Wonderful.</S>
