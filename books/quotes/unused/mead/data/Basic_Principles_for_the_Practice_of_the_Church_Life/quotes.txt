[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE CHURCH AS THE ETERNAL PURPOSE AND HIDDEN MYSTERY OF GOD, AND ITS SOURCE, FUNCTION, AND PRACTICE Scripture Reading: Eph 3:11, 9; John 3:26-30; 2 Cor 5:1
[2]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You for this time that we can come together to learn something of Yourself.
[3]  Lord, we do feel that we are not competent to minister before You in such a matter, so we do trust in You for all the need.
[4]  Lord, we look to You that You would open Your Word to us that we may see from Your Word, through Your Word, and in Your Word something about Yourself and something about Your Body.
[5]  The first thing we have seen is that the church is something of God's eternal purpose, and the second point is that this purpose was hidden in God as a mystery.
[6]  Some may quickly say that the church is the Body of Christ and the house of God.
[7]  The Body of Christ and the house of God are the function of the church, but these aspects do not show us the nature and the source of the church.
[8]  Eve was formed from a rib of Adam, indicating that the bride is the increase of the bridegroom and comes out of the bridegroom as a part of the bridegroom.
[9]  The church is a part of Christ, something coming out of Christ.
[10]  One day God caused Christ to sleep on the cross, and while Christ slept there, God opened Christ, and something came out of Christ.
[11]  The very source, the very nature, and the very essence of the church are nothing less than Christ Himself because the church is one hundred percent out of Christ and a part of Christ.
[12]  The fourth point we must see is the function of the church.
[13]  Now we may come back to the Body of Christ and the house of God.
[14]  First we must realize that the church was formed and founded universally, the church is built up universally, and the church is practiced universally, in the whole universe, and among the human race.
[15]  The local churches comprise the universal church, and the one universal church is the local churches.
[16]  We may illustrate this with our human body, which is one whole with many members.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO THE EXPRESSION, CONTENT, AND ORDER OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Acts 1:8; Phil 1:1; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:5-6
[18]  In the previous chapter we saw five points concerning the church.
[19]  If we have the revelation from the Word of God, we will realize that the church is the center of God's eternal purpose.
[20]  Why did God make the church to be expressed in such a way?
[21]  First, the church must be built up with redeemed persons, and the redeemed persons, even after they have been redeemed, are still on this earth, living in human communities and in human society.
[22]  When I was young, I was taught that all the so-called churches on this earth are not real and that the real church will be in heaven; all the visible churches are not the real churches because the real church is the invisible church.
[23]  We can find the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, the church in Samaria, and the church in Ephesus; we can find many churches on the earth, but we can never find a church in the heavens.
[24]  The Expression of the Church Being One in Every Locality
[25]  Moreover, as the church is expressed on this earth, that expression must be one.
[26]  The church is expressed on this earth in localities where people are gathered, and wherever there is an expression of the church in a locality, it must be one.
[27]  The seventh point which we will consider is the content of the church.
[28]  We must remember well that the content of the church cannot be and should not be anything other than the Lord Christ Himself.
[29]  The church is a container to contain Christ, not anything else.
[30]  As long as we encounter any kind of teaching, any kind of gift, or any kind of knowledge that detaches people from Christ, we must depreciate it because the content of the church is Christ Himself.
[31]  We need to realize very clearly that the church is a corporate vessel as a container to contain Christ, and Christ is the very content of the church.
[32]  The eighth point concerning the church is the order of the church.
[33]  Philippians 1:1 says, "Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons."
[34]  As a group of the Lord's children coming together to realize the church life, to have the expression of the Body, the church, we have a real need of a spiritual order.
[35]  Moreover, we must realize that the content of the church is Christ Himself, and we must learn the lesson by grace to keep our own position so that the order of the church may be kept and maintained, so that we may have the real church life.
[36]  CHAPTER THREE THE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 5:22-25; Gal 3:27-28; 1 Cor 12:12-13
[37]  In the previous chapters we saw that the church is the central thought, the center, of God's eternal purpose.
[38]  On the one hand, we realize that in the church there is no human organization, but on the other hand, the Scriptures tell us clearly that there is an order in the church.
[39]  Not only from the teachings of the Scriptures, but also from our experience we can see that without this order under the Holy Spirit there is no possibility to have the real church life, the real practice of the church.
[40]  PRACTICING THE CHURCH LIFE BY SUBMITTING TO THE HEADSHIP OF THE LORD
[41]  Sometimes elders have come to me, saying, "I simply cannot understand how to be an elder, so I want to resign from the eldership."
[42]  THE PROBLEM OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE CHURCH
[43]  In this chapter we will consider the charter of the church.
[44]  Although there is not such a word as charter in the New Testament, there may not be another word to express this aspect of the church.
[45]  We must speak of the charter of the church because many saints have the thought that if we are going to practice the church life, we must have certain rules, regulations, and bylaws.
[46]  The second item of the spiritual charter of the church is Christ as life.
[47]  In this chapter we shall see something concerning the prayer life in the practice of the church life.
[48]  Strictly speaking, there is no outward charter in the church.
[49]  THE NEED FOR THE LEADING ONES AND SERVING ONES TO PRAY
[50]  The service of a leading one, an elder, a deacon, or a serving one in the church, is firstly a matter of prayer.
[51]  We must pray concerning the responsibility of the church.
[52]  PRAYER BEING THE ONLY WAY TO PRACTICE THE CHURCH LIFE
[53]  If we are going to learn to pray with others in such a way, we must first give up our self and our own thoughts.
[54]  We honor the Lord, we respect the Lord, and we implore the Lord, "Lord, we come to You to seek Your mind.
[55]  Whenever there is a problem or a need, we may declare a fast among the whole church, whether for one meal or for a whole day.
[56]  The whole church must go to the Lord and pray.
[57]  We should learn these practical matters and practice them in our prayer, especially in the corporate prayer.
[58]  CHAPTER SIX THE SPIRITUAL WARFARE OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 6:10-20; Ezek.
[59]  In the New Testament, especially in Ephesians, the book most related to the church, we can see the image and authority of God, that is, the way to express God corporately and fight the battle against the enemy of God in a corporate way.
[60]  If we are the victorious church, if we realize the real church life, then the Lord will be expressed through us that we may have His true image and the heavenly authority to fight the spiritual warfare to deal with the enemy of God.
[61]  The church is the Body of Christ to express and exhibit Christ and to glorify Christ in the divine image, and the church also fights the battle to bring the coming kingdom, to deal with the enemy of God, and to chase away the evil forces of darkness.
[62]  In actuality, the warrior here is a corporate warrior, just as the Body in chapter one, the new man, the house of God, and the building in chapter two, the church as the mystery of Christ in chapter three, the Body and the new man in chapter four, and the bride as the wife in chapter five are all corporate.
[63]  We also must realize that spiritual warfare is not a fighting against humans, that is, against flesh and blood.
[64]  THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD Being Girded with Truth
[65]  Most of the items of the divine armor of God in Ephesians 6 are for protection.
[66]  First, we must gird our loins with truth v. 14a . Truth here does not refer to the doctrine of the word of God, because the word is related to the sword in verse 17.
[67]  The helmet of salvation is for our head v. 17a . As we realize the church life and fight the battle, we always need to pray that the Lord will cover our head.
