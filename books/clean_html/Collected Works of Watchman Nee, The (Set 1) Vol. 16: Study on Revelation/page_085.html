<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Revelation 22:11</H2><P>"Let him who does unrighteousness do unrighteousness still; and let him who is filthy be filthy still; and let him who is righteous do righteousness still; and let him who is holy be holy still."</P><P>This sentence is a continuation of the words "the time is near" in the preceding verse. It implies two things:</P><P>(1)Since the time is near, there will be no opportunity to turn if one does not turn now.</P><P>(2)Within this short period of time, those who would turn will turn, but those who would not turn will remain the same forever.</P><P>It is hard to say whether this word is spoken by the Lord Jesus or by the angels.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE MESSAGE OF THE LORD<br>(REVELATION 22:12-13)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 22:12</H2><P>"Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is." </P><P>"Behold, I come quickly." This, along with verse 7, is said to draw our attention. This verse corresponds to verse 11. The reward will be given according to man's deeds. Therefore, let him who does unrighteousness do unrighteousness still, and let him who is filthy be filthy still, for the Lord is coming soon!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 22:13</H2><P>"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End." </P><P>This expression is mentioned a few times in this book (1:8, 17; 2:8; 21:6; 22:13). The Lord Jesus says this because He wants us to see that Jehovah in the Old Testament is Jesus in the New Testament. Whether it is the age of the patriarchs, the age of the law, or the age of grace, regardless of the method He uses, God Himself remains the same from the beginning to the end. There is only one God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE<br>(REVELATION 22:14-15)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 22:14</H2><P>"Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city."</P><P>This verse declares today's situation. Those who wash their robes are blessed in two ways: (1) "They may have right to the tree of life" and (2) "may enter by the gates into the city." Entering into the city does not refer to being a visitor to the city. According to verse 19 the holy city is the portion of those who have washed their robes.</P><P>"Wash their robes" means to let the effectiveness of the blood of the Lord Jesus be applied to them all the time (7:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 22:15</H2><P>"Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and makes a lie." </P><P>This refers to those who perish. Here we need to consider one thing. Do not the nations live outside the new city? If so, how can we explain this? "Outside" here does not refer to the place where the nations live. If we compare verse 15 with 21:8, we will find that this place "outside" the city is the lake of fire. The new heaven and new earth replace the old heaven and old earth, the New Jerusalem replaces the old Jerusalem, and the lake of fire in the new heaven and new earth replaces today's sea. Hence, the lake of fire outside the new city corresponds to Topheth outside of the old Jerusalem (2 Kings 23:10; Isa. 30:33). A "lake" implies a place of limitation.</P><P>"The dogs." This is a sign. This sign is not very important, and its meaning is not hard to understand. Matthew 7:6 and Philippians 3:2 explain what "the dogs" signify. "The sorcerers" are those who communicate with demons. Saul died because he communicated with demons (1 Sam. 28:8). God delivered Saul to his enemy to be killed. God hates those who communicate with demons the most; He does not want man to find things out from the dead (Lev. 19:31; Deut. 18:11-12). He allows man to understand only the matters that are included within the sphere of this book.</P>
