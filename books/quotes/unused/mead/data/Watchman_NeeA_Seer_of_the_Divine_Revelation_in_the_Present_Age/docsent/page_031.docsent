   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In his second testimony given at Kulangsu, Fukien, on October 20, 1936, he testified of the following:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I wrote The Spiritual Man during my long illness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When it was ready for publication, about four thousand dollars were needed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since there were no means on hand, I asked God to fill the need.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only four co-workers knew of this need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one else knew.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before long the Lord provided four hundred dollars, and we entered into a contract with a printer to commence printing the book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was agreed that should we fail to pay the subsequent installments, we would not only forfeit the cash down payment of four hundred dollars, but we would also pay for the default.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We therefore prayed concerning this matter with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time I was still confined to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever the printer came for his payment, the Lord had always provided us with the means.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Seeing that we were able to maintain good faith, the printer said, "No one but you church people make payments so punctually."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In his open letter in the nineteenth issue of The Present Testimony, published in January-February of 1931, he gave the following testimony:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have no lack of money for printing, although we have asked contributions from no one, and no one has given us an endowment fund.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Himself has put the need of this work in the hearts of men, and little contributions given here and there enable us to accomplish what He wishes us to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We really thank Him!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He gave the following words of gratitude in his open letter in the twelfth issue of The Present Testimony, published December 19, 1929.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was a word of appreciation to the brothers and sisters for their faithfulness, but may also be considered his testimony concerning the Lord's supply:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I feel very grateful concerning this one thing: While I was perplexed on every side, a number of brothers and sisters in the Lord came to help me in my trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the resurrection of the just, may the Lord reward them richly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many brothers and sisters are aware that I do not have a constant livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So for the Lord's sake, from the north and from the south, they deprived themselves, generously and voluntarily supplying me with abundant gifts, that I need not be anxious during my illness concerning my lack.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their excellent kindness and favor toward me has been overflowing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Surely I am not worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am one of the most useless servants of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I quote Paul's words: "You sent both once and again to my need...I seek the fruit which increases to your account."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My only prayer is that your kindness toward me would not be for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that when I am up again, I may be able to accomplish a small portion of my work in God's enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Besides their financial supply, many brothers and sisters have written to show me their concern, and I express my thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I say to all who have ministered to me in such a way: Please accept my grateful, heartfelt thanks.</S>
