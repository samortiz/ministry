   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Asking Joseph to Put His Hand under His Thigh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 47:29 says, "And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This matter of having Joseph place his hand under Jacob's thigh has been a problem to many Bible students.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jacob did not say to Joseph, "Do your best to get a physician to heal me."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, he asked him to place his hand under his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the significance of this?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No doubt, it means to swear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But why did Jacob not have Joseph raise his hand if the significance of this act were only that of taking an oath?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead of guessing, we should understand the Bible according to the facts contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we can trace what happened to Jacob's thigh during his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the eighth day after he was born, Jacob was circumcised in a part of his body close to his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then after Jacob had been striving for more than ninety-five years, God came in to touch his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, Jacob experienced both circumcision and a divine touch.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, something was cut off from a place very close to his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That was circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Years later, Jacob experienced a divine touch that caused him to walk with a limp.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you look deeply into the significance of these two things, you will see that both have the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be circumcised is to have our flesh, our natural life, cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jacob had been chosen to inherit God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But his flesh, his natural life, was not useful for this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, it was a hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consider the case of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's covenant was made with Abraham in Genesis 15.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abraham, however, used his natural strength with Hagar to fulfill God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was offended by this and stayed away from Abraham for thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thirteen years later, God came back to Abraham and seemed to say, "Abraham, I am the all-sufficient One.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I will keep My promise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because I have promised to do something for you, I don't need you to use your natural strength to fulfill what I have promised.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What you did with Hagar greatly offended Me. For that reason, I have stayed away from you for these thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now I have come to tell you that in My presence you must cut off your natural strength."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From that day onward, God's covenant of grace became the covenant of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The covenant of circumcision means that the covenant of grace cannot be fulfilled or inherited through man's natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would inherit God's promise of grace, our natural strength must be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On God's side, this covenant is a covenant of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But on man's side, it has become the covenant of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God still intends to give grace to man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, in order to receive God's covenanted grace, we must have our natural strength cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jacob's circumcision was a sign that he was not supposed to live by his flesh or natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, after his circumcision, Jacob continued striving in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although he had been circumcised, he lived as one who had not been circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How much he exercised his strength to inherit God's promise!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He used his ability to supplant and to scheme as if he had never been circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Symbolically Jacob had been circumcised; but in reality he was not circumcised until he had been dealt with by God for many years and was in his nineties.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For twenty years Jacob was under the hand of Laban, who nearly exhausted Jacob's strength.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, Jacob was forced to leave Laban and return to the land of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As he was on the way home, God raised up circumstances to force him to go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Laban was pursuing him, and Esau was awaiting him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, Jacob was in a dilemma, wondering what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He seemed to say to himself, "What shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I go backward, Laban is there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But if I go forward, Esau is there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no place to which I can flee."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At Peniel he sent away his wives and children and stayed alone to make a deal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That night Jacob was so strong in his flesh that he even wrestled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord touched Jacob's thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That was Jacob's real circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From that time onward, Jacob was lame.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As Jacob was departing this life, he did not have strength even to walk; he could only lie on the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we have seen, Jacob's real circumcision took place when God touched his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now his lying on the bed was another genuine touch from God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After the first touch, Jacob could no longer walk in a normal way, but now he could not even get out of bed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His natural strength truly had been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, we may consider this as Jacob's third circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the time of his first circumcision, he was hardly affected at all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After the second circumcision, his thigh was touched and he became lame; however, he could still move.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But now at the time of the third circumcision he had no ability to move at all.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This was the time for him to trust absolutely in the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you cannot do anything, when you are not able to move, and when you have no strength, that is the time for you to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because Jacob had no more trust in himself, he asked Joseph to place his hand under his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This indicated that Jacob recognized that he had no strength to do anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The only thing he could do was trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His son Joseph, the premier of the leading country on earth, certainly could do something for him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whatever would be done for him after his death would be done by Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, Jacob asked him to place his hand under his thigh, recognizing by making this request that he had been dealt with by God to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Jacob was declaring to the whole universe that he no longer had the strength to do anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather, he could only cleave to God's promise of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>During his lifetime Jacob had learned one thing: that he could not do anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All he had done was in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Thus, he came to trust in God's promise of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>To him, that promise was the promise of circumcision, of terminating his natural strength to inherit God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How vivid and beautiful is this first aspect of Jacob's departure!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Here is a man who has learned by experience that it is all a matter of God's grace, not a matter of his doing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He realized that he had been circumcised, that he had been touched by God and was not able to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I repeat, when Jacob was eight days old, he was circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When he was more than ninety years old, he was touched by God and became lame.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now at the age of one hundred forty-seven he was confined to bed, unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He surely needed God's grace, which at that time was represented by Joseph and was concentrated in him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Joseph was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Jacob's trust was in God's grace, which is focused in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>His confidence was no longer in his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The thigh is the strongest part of our being, for by the strength of our thigh we walk and support ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Jacob's thigh had been circumcised and touched.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Because he had been fully terminated, he turned absolutely from his natural strength to God's grace in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Joseph's hand, signifying the hand of God's grace, was not placed upon Jacob's thigh, but under it.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This indicates that the strong hand of God's grace bore Jacob for the fulfillment of God's covenant of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It was not by Jacob's strength, but by the hand of Joseph, that Jacob was brought to the good land for his actual inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is not by our strength, but by the grace of Christ that we inherit God's promise.</S>
