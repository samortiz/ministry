Christ's power is transcendent. He ascended into the heavens and was made Head over all things to the church. The word to implies a transfusing. Christ is transfusing Himself as the ascended One into our intrinsic being to make us a part of Him, the ascended One. Today we are in ascension because the ascended One has been transfused into us. I have the feeling that I am not in the world or in myself but in the ascended One and in the ascension.</P><P>The issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ in His attainment to be the Head over all things is the Body of Christ. Christ, the ascended One, has been made the Head over all things to the church, which is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God and of the transfusing of the ascended Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MINISTERING<br>OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST</H2><P>Ephesians 3:8-11 reveals that the Body of Christ is the consummation of the ministering of the riches of Christ. The apostle Paul ministered the unsearchable riches of Christ into all of the believers, and such a ministry has a consummation. The consummation of this ministry of the riches of Christ into our being is the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE-HUMAN CONSTITUTION</H2><P>Ephesians 4:3-6 shows that the Body of Christ is a divine-human constitution constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God and the regenerated, transformed humanity. The framework of the Body, the composition of the Body, is the uplifted, transformed humanity. Once we were in sin as sinners, but through His regeneration, sanctification, and transformation we have been transformed and uplifted. We all can testify that when we are in the meetings of the church or of the ministry, we are greatly uplifted. The uplifted humanity which is transformed is the framework of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The intrinsic essence of the Body is the Spirit. Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit." There is one Body, one framework, and one essence, one Spirit. Ephesians 4:4-6 mentions the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father of all. The Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence of the one Body. The three in the Godhead are distinct but They are never separated. Instead, according to the New Testament teaching, wherever the Spirit is, the Son and the Father are also there. The Father is over all, through all, and in all (v. 6). The Trinity is implied even here. Over all refers mainly to the Father, through all to the Son, and in all to the Spirit. The Triune God eventually enters into us all by reaching us as the Spirit. This is the mingling, and this mingling is a constitution of the Triune God as the essence, the element, and the source and of the uplifted, transformed humanity as the framework. Such a divine-human constitution is the Body of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
