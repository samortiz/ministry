   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord s Human Living</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning of my Christian life, I wondered why God did not save us in a fast way, in a way like His work in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I asked my pastor about this, he told me that because we are human beings it was necessary for our Savior to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In creation, of course, there was no need for God to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in salvation it certainly was necessary for Him to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was easier for God to create man than it was for Him to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In creating man God had no difficulty; He simply did the work of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But God became involved with certain difficulties when He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His creation God merely did certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But in His salvation He not only did things He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As I considered God s incarnation for our salvation, I realized that it was logical for God to become a man in order to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I still did not understand why He needed to live on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why did He not become a man, stay on earth for a short period of time, perhaps a month, and then go to the cross to accomplish redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did He need to become a baby growing day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Luke 2:40 says, And the little child grew and became strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we see that the Lord Jesus grew in a normal way; He did not grow to full stature in a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, instead of preaching for only several days and then dying for our redemption, the Lord Jesus ministered for three and a half years before going to the cross to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the four Gospels we have a lengthy record of the Lord s life and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospel of Matthew, for example, contains twenty-eight chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of simply telling that the Lord Jesus was born and that He died for our redemption and was resurrected, Matthew records many other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Gospels we see that the Man-Savior did not grow up miraculously; on the contrary, He grew up in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But why was this necessary?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we were fallen and sinful, we needed the Lord Jesus to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He suffered a vicarious death for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But why did He need to suffer so many things during the thirty-three and a half years of His life?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, only the last three hours on the cross were hours of vicarious suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During the first three hours He did not suffer vicariously.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the second period of three hours, God came in to judge the Man-Savior as our Substitute, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour Luke 23:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why, then, did He need to suffer during His first three hours on the cross, since that suffering was not for our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For years I tried to find answers to these questions in books, but I failed to do so in full.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Answers in full to these questions came only as a result of more than fifty years of personal, direct study of the Word, especially during the last ten years in which we have been carrying on the Life-study of the New Testament, a study that will be completed with the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD S WAY OF SAVING US</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us compare two possible ways of saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, suppose God simply stretches forth His hand, snatches a sinner out of hell, and brings him to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This way of saving a person would be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second way, the way taken by God, is much more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to His way, God became a man and lived a human life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through His incarnation God brought the divine attributes into the human virtues, filling, restoring, recovering, sanctifying, and transforming them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider how much time it required for man s virtues to be uplifted and transformed in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In His salvation, God does not simply snatch people out of hell and bring them into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, for our salvation the saving God became a man and lived the kind of life on earth that qualified Him to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This life also became the basic factor of the Man-Savior s dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The procedure that qualified the Man-Savior required a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first step of God s salvation was to become a man, live on earth, die on the cross, and be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the second step, the Man-Savior comes into the saved ones, lives in us, and grows in us, repeating His life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only does the Lord grow gradually in the believers; He has also been spreading gradually throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead of suddenly spreading everywhere, the Lord has spread gradually from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At first, His spread was only in the area of the Mediterranean Sea, and eventually He spread to North America and to China.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day, He came into me and you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Fifty-nine years ago, in 1925, the Man-Savior came into me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From that time onward, He has been living in me and growing in me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How shall we speak of the Lord s saving us by coming into us and living in us?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may say that this is salvation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the term salvation in life has been damaged by some Bible teachers who actually do not know adequately what it means to be saved in life Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to the Bible, life is God Himself coming into us to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It takes time for us to be saved in this way.</S>
