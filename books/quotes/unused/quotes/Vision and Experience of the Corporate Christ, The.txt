After man fell into sin, the world, and the self, he realized that he could not continue to exist in such a low condition
In dictionaries and often in literature religion is a positive word, because religion is the best invention in human culture
No religion-not Buddhism, nor Judaism, nor Christianity-can do anything to rescue us out of our fallen situation
Religion may improve man a little, but it can never remove him out of one situation and place him into another situation
We need to consider the possibility that we are confined in our own concept or in the concept we picked up from our religious background
In a sense for human beings to fear God believe in the Lord Jesus be saved try to be good persons and help others to be saved is very good
By the Lord's mercy we have the divine Word, including both the Old Testament and the New Testament, from Genesis through Revelation
We need to see not only that Christ is the Lamb of God but also that Christ is the Bridegroom who will have His bride
The apostle John wrote I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
Our destiny is not to go up to heaven but to come down out of heaven to the earth as the bride whom Christ will marry
When we meet as the church today, we are joyful because we experience a foretaste of the wedding feast of Christ and the church
Genesis 1 through Revelation 22 reveals that the 'bachelor' God marries a city-lady composed of all His redeemed people
He replied that the first half of him arrived at a certain time and that the second half of him arrived a little later
He created the heavens and the earth, and in the heavens and the earth He created man in His image in order that man would match Him
In His economy God is no longer only God but God mingled with humanity, and He is ready for man to take Him in
All the different practices among Christians can never satisfy us because God will never be satisfied with practices
God's satisfaction rests in one thing-His gathering of His seekers and building them together into His corporate bride
Most Christians think that their destiny is to go to heaven, but the Word reveals that the holy city will eventually come down out of heaven
When this prophecy was fulfilled in the New Testament , God was no longer merely God Himself but was 'God-plus,' God with man
His purpose is not merely that we would be saved or that we would seek after Him, love Him, fear Him, and try to be spiritual
God's purpose is altogether a matter of our being built together as a corporate entity to become the holy city
All that God is will be continually received by His people to be their constitution, and they will be part of Him
Although creation reveals the existence of a Creator, to try to know what kind of God He is by examining nature would be very difficult
We all need to be freed from the 'cage' of religion to soar in a clear sky to see the revelation in the pure Word
According to Zechariah 12:1, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and because man has a spirit, he is for God
Today science proves that the heavens are for the earth, for without the sun and the atmosphere life on earth would be impossible
Everything on the earth-the minerals, the vegetables, and the animals-is for us, as those prepared by God to contain Him, to exist
While the incarnated God was living on earth, He was a little Nazarene named Jesus, yet this man was irresistibly attractive
During the three and a half years of His earthly ministry, He did many wonderful things that no one could explain
They knew His mother and His brothers and sisters , and they knew He came from Nazareth, but they did not know who He truly was
They did not know that He was not merely God or merely a man but the God-man, the incarnated God, God manifested in the flesh
It was not those people who caused Him to go to the cross; rather, it was He Himself who chose to go to the cross
Luke 23:27-28 says, 'A great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him followed Him
We were redeemed by His walking into death and coming out of death and now death has no power over us for we are in Christ the redeeming One
Fundamental Christians, on the other hand, do believe in the God revealed in these three stages, that is, up to redemption
After the Gospels are the Acts and the Epistles, which reveal that the redeeming God has become the indwelling God
We cannot explain how something physical could enter into a house without any open doors, but the Lord Jesus did this
The Triune God-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit-is not three separate Gods, as some Christians believe
The Christian life and the church life are not a matter of ethics, culture, or religion but a matter of the indwelling God
After the bachelor God the incarnated God the redeeming God and the indwelling God are revealed God is revealed as the incorporated God
From the throne it spirals out, passing through every part of the city, until it reaches the gates at the wall
They believe in the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, but redemption is seemingly all they know
Their knowledge and experience are truly deeper than most because they care for the indwelling Christ, the Spirit
After being redeemed, we surely need to go on from the four Gospels to the Epistles to enjoy Christ as the indwelling One
We have all been baptized into Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, and have also been positioned to drink one Spirit
In eternity whoever is outside of the New Jerusalem will not drink the river of water of life or eat the tree of life
God can be nothing to us if we are outside of the New Jerusalem, but God will be everything to us if we are in the New Jerusalem
How wonderful it is that in the Body, which we experience in the church life today, we enjoy God in all these stages!
In the church life, the practical expression of the Body of Christ, we are positioned to enjoy the incorporated God
On the other hand, the vision presented in Revelation shows that for eternity God will be located in the New Jerusalem
The night after His resurrection He came to His disciples, breathed into them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
When He breathed into His disciples, they received Him, and He never left them, for He had become the indwelling God
When the New Jerusalem is completed, the universe will marvel at this corporate entity, humanity constituted and mingled with divinity
The Gospel of John reveals that the Word, who was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality
One day He said to them, 'If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him'
Perhaps Philip and the disciples began to understand that Christ and the Father were one, but the Lord went on to reveal something further
He needed to pass through death and resurrection so that He could return to them in another form, a form in which He could enter into them
Our commission from the Lord in Matthew 28:19 is to baptize people not in the name of the Triune God but into His name
Because Jesus is real, living, near, and available, the more we call on His name, the more we receive His person
Before the resurrection of Christ, the Bible does not reveal the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
He was no longer raw but had passed through incarnation thirtythree and a half years of human living crucifixion burial and resurrection
God is triune not for our doctrinal understanding but so that He could pass through a process to become available for us to enjoy
When a person calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we should baptize him into the Triune God, into the living Christ, and into His Body
Most Christians agree that Matthew 28:19 refers to water baptism, but there is argument about Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27
According to the Bible, however, there is no such distinction in our experience; water baptism is Spirit baptism
If they stay by themselves, they may enjoy a small portion of the individual Christ, but they will never enjoy the riches of the Body-Christ
If we do not come to the meetings and open up our mouth to release the riches of Christ, we will have only our individual portion of Christ
If any member of our body does not participate in the circulation of blood, that member will eventually become unpleasant and infected
Because each of us is a member of Christ's Body and has a portion of Christ, we all need to release our Christ to one another
He has been processed through five stages: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and entering into us
He has gone on to recover many other items of truth since the sixteenth century, and today He is recovering even more items
No matter how many times they read and study the Scriptures, they see only the letters on the page, not the reality
We may know doctrinally that Christ is unsearchably rich, but we need to see how we can receive the riches of Christ
The living Word, which is Christ, is always available, but if we keep our mouth shut, we will not partake of Him
In ordinary times they may prefer to discuss doctrines, but when they are in a difficult situation, they call, 'O Lord Jesus'
Similarly, there is no better way for a person to participate in the riches of Christ than by calling on His name
Any time we are in a difficult situation, if we would simply call on the Lord, there will be comfort in our spirit
The One on whom we call is the God of creation, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, the indwelling God, and the incorporated God
We need to realize that today our Jesus is no longer the 'raw' God but the processed and incorporated God, who is all and in all
We need to come together as the church in a united, knit-together way, having our heart and mind knit together with all the saints
If the church decides to do something that we do not agree with, we should not be dissenting but should simply go along with the church
If we are knit together with the church we will have the full assurance of understanding and the full knowledge of the mystery of God Christ
We can do this by calling on the name of the Lord, the living Word, when we are pray-reading the Bible, the written word
To call on the name of the Lord is to breathe the Spirit into us, and to pray-read is to eat the word, which is Christ
When we call on the name of the Lord and pray-read, we receive the Spirit as our spiritual breath and the word as our spiritual food
We need to drink in the Body by coming to the church meetings to call and pray-read together with all the saints
Verse 19 goes on to say, 'To know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God'
We need to be strengthened to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God
The Bible is a record of creation and salvation; however, the final word, Revelation 21 and 22, reveals that the Bible is about building
Revelation 21 and 22 are the consummate, closing word of the divine speaking of more than one thousand chapters
On the twelve layers of the foundation are twelve precious stones, and the foundations bear the names of the twelve apostles
Every Christian knows that the Bible opens with creation, but very few realize that the Bible consummates with a building
There is indeed a physical heaven where Christ the Son is with God the Father, but heaven is not God's goal or our destination
Our destination is something much better, higher, and more glorious than heaven; our destination is the New Jerusalem
The Lord Jesus told the Pharisees, 'You nicely set aside the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition
The Bible clearly reveals that there is something glorious called the holy city and the New Jerusalem that will descend out of heaven
We all need to see that the closing word, the ultimate word, of the revelation of the Holy Scriptures concerns building
The opening word concerns creation, and the word of process concerns salvation, but the closing and consummate word concerns building
Peter preached that Christ is not only the Savior but also the cornerstone to connect the two walls of God's building
From his days as a young disciple, Peter never forgot that he was a stone or that Christ was the rock on which the church is built
When we allow the water of life to flow through us, this water brings in all the divine, heavenly minerals, which are all that God is
In Ephesians 2:20 Paul wrote that Christ is both the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets and the cornerstone of the building
The Jewish believers and the Gentile believers represent different walls in God's building, and Christ stands as the connecting cornerstone
The foundation stone supports the building, the cornerstone connects the building, and the topstone completes the building
Christ is the foundation stone the cornerstone and the topstone of Gods building and we are precious stones to be built into this building
In Ephesians 2:21 Paul said, 'In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord'
According to verse 21, we need to be fitted together, that is, made suitable for the condition and situation of the building
In this constructed unit the building of the New Jerusalem there is the tree of life a flowing river and gold pearls and precious stones
Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink
Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city'
The way to be built in is not by praying for the Lord to cut off our sharp corners and rough edges so that we will fit into the building
As we eat Christ and drink the Spirit, we will be constituted with Christ and will corporately become the Body-Christ
If we had been born in the second century, we would not be able to see a clear picture of God's eternal purpose
Through the past centuries many great teachers have found various parts of the puzzle and have placed them properly one by one
We are not boasting that we have seen the picture of God's eternal purpose, for we are standing on others' shoulders to see this vision
Christ making His home in our hearts is the experience of God working Himself into us to fulfill His eternal purpose
The trinity of the Godhead is not mainly for teaching or doctrine but for His process and for His being dispensed into us
For a large melon to be dispensed into us, it needs to exist in three stages or three forms-melon, slices, and juice
The juice does not remain there but is digested and assimilated into all our cells to constitute the organic tissue of our body
The Lord is already in our spirit but we need to allow Him to spread from our spirit into our heart so that He can settle down in our heart
By our drinking the Spirit and allowing Christ to make His home in our heart, Christ dispenses Himself into all our being
Eventually, all the rich elements of Christ will be wrought into our being, and our negative elements will be discharged
If we are being transformed, we will spontaneously have an appetite to go to the meetings and fellowship with the saints
We too know God in all these ways but today by the Lords grace we have been brought on to enjoy Christ as the BodyChrist in the church life
