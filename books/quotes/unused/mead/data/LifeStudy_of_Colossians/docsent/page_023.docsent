   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then, in the very same verse, Paul says that Christ is the firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why does he put these two matters together, the image of the invisible God and the firstborn of all creation?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Son of His love, the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance Heb 1:3 , is His image, expressing what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The image here does not mean a physical form, but an expression of God s being in all His attributes and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This interpretation is confirmed by Colossians 3:10 and 2 Corinthians 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To say that Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the image of God implies that He is the very God, the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we see Christ, we see the expression of the invisible God, for He Himself is God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I had written the Epistle to the Colossians, I would have said simply that Christ is God the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul, however, did not write in such a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He said that Christ is the image of the invisible God, God Himself expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>FIRST AMONG ALL CREATURES</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1:15 Paul goes on to say that Christ is the firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that in creation Christ is the first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ as God is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, as man, sharing the created blood and flesh Heb 2:14 , He is part of the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Firstborn of all creation refers to Christ s preeminence in all creation, since from this verse through verse 18 the apostle stresses the first place of Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This verse reveals that Christ is not only the Creator, but also the first among all created things, the first among all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some insist that Christ is only the Creator, not a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the Bible reveals that Christ is both the Creator and a creature, for He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As God, Christ is the Creator, but as man, He is a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How could He have flesh, blood, and bones if He were not a creature?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Did not Christ become a man?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Did He not take on a body with flesh, blood, and bones?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Certainly He did.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who oppose this teaching are short of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, they are heretical, because they do not believe that Christ truly became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, they believe only that He is God, and such a belief is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Christ is God, has always been God, and always will be God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But through incarnation He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Otherwise He could not have been arrested, tried, and crucified; and He could not have shed His blood on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Praise the Lord for the truth that our Christ is both God and man!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As God, Christ is eternal and did not need to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in 1:15 He is called the firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Anything that requires birth must be a creature, part of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If Christ were only God and not man, He could not have been born, for God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But as a man, Christ had to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hallelujah, Christ was born as a man!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Isaiah 9:6 says, For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called The mighty God, The everlasting Father....</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the child born to us, Christ is called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Son given to us, His name is called the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the mighty God and the eternal Father, Christ is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But as the child and a son, He had to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some argue that Christ was born, but not created.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the Bible, birth is the carrying out of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, to be born is to be created.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>NO TIME ELEMENT WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some may wonder how Christ could be the firstborn of all creation since He was born less than two thousand years ago, not at the very beginning of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we would understand this properly, we need to realize that with God there is no time element.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, according to our estimate of time, Christ was crucified about two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But Revelation 13:8 says that Christ was slain from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Both are right.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, God s reckoning is much more important than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the eyes of God, Christ was crucified from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In eternity, God foresaw the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, also in eternity, He made preparation for the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The difference between God s estimate of time and ours also helps us understand why Christ is called the second man 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>From our point of view, the second man was Cain, the son of the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But from God s point of view, the second man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We may apply this matter of the different ways of reckoning time to Christ as the firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to our sense of time, Christ was born in Bethlehem approximately two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But in the eyes of God, the Lord Jesus was born before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If He was slain from the foundation of the world, certainly He must have been born before then.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, according to God s perspective in eternity, Christ was born in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the reason that, according to God s viewpoint, Christ has always been the first of all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God foresaw the day that Christ would be born in a manger in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because Christ is the first among the creatures, we can say that as the all-inclusive One He is both the Creator and part of creation.</S>
