   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLDING FACTOR OF THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you expect to have one accord in any kind of society, group, or movement, you need the same kind of thinking that comes out of the same kind of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Socialist party stresses socialism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Any political party has its own ism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They stress their ism in order to have a party, to have what we call the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without the one accord, no party could accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Any society, group, or movement needs this one accord that comes out of the same kind of thought, the same kind of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, Acts tells us that on the one hand, there was one accord among the disciples, and on the other hand, all those who were one in one accord were continuing in the teaching of the apostles 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The teaching of the apostles was the very holding factor of the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there were more than one teaching, this would damage the holding factor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE LEADERSHIP IN GOD S MOVE IN ACTS Peter s Leadership in Acts 1 12</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now let us look into the book of Acts, which is a record of the Lord s people soon after His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the time the Lord Jesus began His ministry in the heavens, His people acted on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the book of Acts there are two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapters one through twelve are the first section, and chapters thirteen through twenty-eight are the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the first twelve chapters the Lord s move with one accord was according to Peter s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time, John was there also, but the teaching was not given through two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was given through Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though John went with Peter and was with Peter much of the time, the mouthpiece was only one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no message recorded in Acts that was given by John.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 2:42 says, They were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this verse apostles is plural, but we must realize that the mouthpiece in giving the teachings was one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the first section of Acts, we see that Peter had his weaknesses and that he even made mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Chapter ten shows us that Peter was not that strong in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was still remaining, at least partially, in God s Old Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God showed him the unclean animals and told him to eat, Peter responded, By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean 10:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This response was something of God s Old Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although Peter was taught directly and personally by the Lord Jesus for three and a half years and was trained so much and used so much as the top speaker of God s New Testament economy, he still remained in the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was his shortcoming and his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter was greatly adjusted and corrected but not in full.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the time of Galatians 2, Paul was a learner compared with Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter was a first generation apostle and Paul was the second generation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While Peter was the top apostle, Paul as Saul of Tarsus was a young man persecuting the apostles, opposing the church, and trying to defeat the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul, a younger apostle, rebuked Peter to his face, pointing out Peter s hypocrisy in remaining in the old dispensation 2:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Acts 10 Peter s problem was concerning the matter of eating, and in Galatians 2 it was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When some Judaized believers came from James, a godly man always trying to compromise with the old economy of God, Peter took the lead to shrink back and separate himself from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before the men came down from James in Jerusalem, Peter, Barnabas, and the rest of the Jews were eating with the Gentiles because Peter had been adjusted by the Lord in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peter, though, took the lead to practice hypocrisy, and the rest of the Jews and Barnabas followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Acts 10 Peter was short, but in Galatians 2 he was weak.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be short means that you do not have something.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be weak means that you have it, but you dare not to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, Peter made a big mistake, nearly leading the entire church to go astray from God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to take care of the truth of the gospel, Paul did not tolerate the situation for one minute.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though Peter was older than he, Paul rebuked him to his face.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter made such a big mistake, though he was the mouthpiece in the first twelve chapters of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Catholic teaching is that Peter was the successor of Christ, and as His successor he could never have made a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Catholic church also maintains that it could never be mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their people are taught to listen to the church, but what they mean by the church is the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever the pope says means everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They say that the pope cannot make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To them all the popes are successors of Peter, and Peter was the successor of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually the popes have made many mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One great mistake was a decree saying that Mary, the so-called holy mother, the mother of God, was sinless!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What a great mistake!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My point is this do not think that any leader could not make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only the Lord Jesus, the unique Leader, never made any mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is absolutely impossible for Him to be mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, all of us, including Peter, have made many mistakes.</S>
