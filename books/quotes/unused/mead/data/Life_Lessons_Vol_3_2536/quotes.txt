[1]  Then the last two volumes cover the full salvation which God has prepared in Christ for us who have believed into Him, the riches which we have obtained in Christ, the experience which we should have in Christ, the things which we should accomplish in Christ, and the goal which we should attain in Christ.
[2]  It is suggested that this lesson, which is lengthy and deep, be read at two different times, the second beginning from the section on Transferred into Christ on page 10.
[3]  The twenty-four lessons of the previous two volumes were an overview of the different matters between us and God which we, the sinners, should realize, know, and practice after we have believed in the Lord to be saved and have become a saint of God and of the Lord.
[4]  When we enter into Christ through believing and being baptized, God puts the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ into our spirit that we and Christ may have a spiritual organic union; all of this is God s doing.
[5]  It is God who placed us in Christ and put the Spirit and the life of Christ into us that we might be joined as one with Christ in spirit.
[6]  After we have believed and are baptized into Christ, we have a life union with Christ and are joined to Him.
[7]  When we believe and are baptized into Christ, we are in Christ.
[8]  To maintain such a position in Christ and to continue to enjoy all the riches in Him, we must continue to remain in Him, with the result that we abide in Him.
[9]  In other words, the eternal life, the life of God in Christ, that is, Christ Himself as life, brings a fellowship to us, that we may have fellowship not only with the apostles but also with God and Christ.
[10]  1 As His anointing...has taught you, abide in Him Christ 1 John 2:27 .
[11]  To abide in Christ, in addition to being according to the teaching of the anointing of the Holy Spirit and walking as the Lord walked, we must keep God s commandments, God s charges to us, and be those who are submissive to God.
[12]  It is suggested that this deeper lesson be read at two different times, the second beginning from the section on Living Christ on page 30.
[13]  We believe and are baptized into Christ to be joined to Him and to abide in Him for the purpose of experiencing Him.
[14]  Once Christ is revealed in us, we immediately experience His being in us, which shows us that our body is dead because of sin, the very sin we inherited from Adam, and that our spirit is life because of righteousness, the righteousness we obtained from Christ.
[15]  When we abide in Christ according to the fact of our being in Christ, Christ will abide in us, placing Himself in us to be our life and life supply that He may become our experience in life for us to bear much fruit.
[16]  The main revelation in the New Testament, especially in Paul s Epistles, is the very Christ, whom God in His economy has prepared for us to be our experience.
[17]  In experiencing Christ, Paul was found by others to be a man in Christ, not having a righteousness which was from his own keeping of the law, but having the righteousness from God through his faith in Christ, which is just Christ Himself lived out from him to be expressed as his righteousness.
[18]  1 One thing forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus Phil 3:13-14 .
[19]  Paul, who pursued the knowledge of Christ in order to experience Him more deeply, considered his pursuit of Christ to be his only task.
[20]  We can experience Christ and take Christ as everything because we have become one spirit with Him.
[21]  This is a deep mystery, yet it is a sure fact which each of us who has believed into Christ and is joined to Him in His divine life must believe, confess, and practice.
[22]  LESSON THIRTY-ONE LIVING IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE
[23]  Once we believe into the Lord, we have a union with Him in life.
[24]  1 We...report to you the eternal life...that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[25]  Once we believe in the Lord and receive the eternal life, which was reported to us, it brings its fellowship of life, its flow of life, to us, that there may be a fellowship, a flow, between us and God.
[26]  4 To confess our sins But if we walk in the light...we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His God s Son cleanses us from all sin...if we confess our sins, He God is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us...and cleanse us 1 John 1:7-9 .
[27]  When we believe into Christ and are joined to Him in life, His life in us produces a sense of life, which we who are joined to Him, who are one spirit with Him, and who experience Him must pay attention to and obey in our spiritual life.
[28]  The moment we receive the Son of God as our Savior, we have the Son of God and we have the life, because the life is in Him 1 John 5:11 .
[29]  Since the light of life is the Lord s life shining in us, this shining will definitely produce a sense of life within, so that we may sense what is of the Lord and what is pleasing to Him.
[30]  Since both the laws written on our hearts by God and the law of the Spirit of life within us are an innate function of the Lord s life in us, whenever this function is manifested, we will have a feeling.
[31]  Obeying the sense of life is related to Christ as life within us, whereas obeying the teaching of the anointing is related to the moving of the Holy Spirit within us.
[32]  These two together are just one thing, that is, to live in the Spirit of life, to live and walk by following the operation of the law of life, and to live a spiritual and victorious life which manifests the Triune God in Christ.
[33]  Obedience to the sense of life is related to Christ as life and is a matter of life; obedience to the teaching of the anointing is related to the Holy Spirit s anointing, or moving, as the ointment and is a matter of the Spirit of life; walking according to spirit concerns our walk according to the mingled spirit, and is not only a matter of the Spirit of life but also of our regenerated spirit.
[34]  Christ as life causes us to have the sense of life, the anointing and moving of the Holy Spirit causes us to be taught by the Spirit, and our being mingled with the Spirit of the Lord s life into one spirit causes us to walk in our spirit according to the sense of the Lord s life, which comes from the moving of the Spirit of life.
[35]  Such a living causes our flesh, our self, our soul, and our natural life to lose their position and function, and allows the processed Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, to gain the full ground in us in order that He may reach the goal of mingling Himself with our tripartite being, the spirit, the soul, and the body, that is, that we may be fully occupied by Him and filled and saturated with Him, taking Him as our life, our person, and our everything, that we may be completely one with Him to be His full expression.
[36]  If we, the believers, live a life in the Triune God that is sanctified, spiritual, victorious, and one spirit with the Lord according to that which was covered in the previous ten lessons of this volume, we will surely await the Lord s coming with eager expectation.
[37]  After we have believed in the Lord and are saved, because of the demand of the divine life which we have received and because of the intensity of our love toward the Lord, we desire to pursue a life that awaits the Lord s coming.
[38]  In such a life of loving the Lord and waiting for the Lord, we also expect, according to that which is revealed and prophesied in the Bible, to be raptured to the Lord, to meet together joyfully with Him.
