   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE SERVING ONES AND THE SERVICE Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1-2, 11; 1 John 5:16; John 15:4-5, 16a; 21:15-17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Christian needs to pay attention to both life and service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 25 there are two parables.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first parable, concerning the ten virgins, stresses life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1-13 , whereas the second parable, concerning the distribution of talents, stresses service vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>14-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the aspect of life, we are virgins, loving the Lord, fellowshipping with Him, living a chaste, pure life, taking our lamps, and going out of this dark age to meet Him as our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time, in the aspect of service, we are slaves of the Lord, who must be faithful with what He entrusts to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>PRESENTING OUR WHOLE BEING FOR THE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 12 is a chapter on service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we read this chapter carefully, we will see that Paul is very wise in his speaking in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He first speaks of presenting our body, then of being transformed by the renewing of the mind, and finally of being burning in spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1-2, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His speaking corresponds to the three parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our body should be presented, our mind should be renewed, and our spirit should be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All three parts of our being are involved in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some are burning in spirit, but their mind has not been renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In such a situation, a burning spirit cannot produce a proper result by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some are burning in spirit and have been transformed in their mind, but their body is not presented.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As such, their talk about service has no impact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some have presented their body; that is, they attend every meeting and participate in various aspects of service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They pray, read the Bible, and fellowship with the saints, and they also help with cleaning, ushering, and visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, their mind is old and in need of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When such a person is not present, everything is peaceful, but whenever he is present, he disturbs the peaceful situation and causes the church to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Honestly speaking, there are too many opinions in our service today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without a doubt, these opinions are related to a lack of renewing in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When our mind is renewed and transformed, there is harmony and oneness in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church in Los Angeles there are brothers and sisters from many different races.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In such a church the minds of the saints must be renewed in order to avoid conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am thankful that the situation in Los Angeles is marvelous and that the meetings are truly beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This situation could not be achieved even through the United Nations, because the church is more than a United Nations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not need to be united; we are simply one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are one in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, we need to be transformed by being renewed in our mind with the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we have presented our body and are renewed in our mind, we still need to be burning in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can use a steam locomotive as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A train may be at a station and its passengers can be properly seated, but the train conductor needs to fire up the boiler in the locomotive in order for the train to move forward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After we have presented our body and have been renewed and transformed in our mind, we still need to be burning in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we are burning in spirit, our entire being will move.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to consider the condition of each part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Presenting Our Bodies in Time</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We first need to consider whether or not our body has been presented.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Presenting our body is a matter related to time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are unwilling to give our time, our body cannot be presented.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we consecrate our body, we are really consecrating our time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We live in our body, and our body lives in time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we present our body, we are giving our time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we say that we have a heart to love the Lord but are busy every day of the week, our body will not be presented.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are very busy but agree to set aside half an hour a week to serve the Lord, we are presenting our body for half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to see that presenting our body requires the giving of time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today the whole church should serve as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is so practical that Paul says we should present our body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to present our body, we must set aside our time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, the Lord s word that we need to be fishers of men touches us all Matt 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, in order to fish for men we need time; we cannot merely shout and declare in the meetings that we are fishers of men.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every fisherman knows that fishing is very laborious and time-consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many of us have told the Lord that we would lead one person to salvation in the coming year.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, without spending time, we will never lead one person to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Time is required to carry this out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This does not mean that all our time, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, must be devoted to this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We still need to work, eat, do household chores, and many other mundane matters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Nevertheless, the consecration of our time must be specific.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every week we should set aside at least two hours for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a must in order for us to be effective in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should set aside two hours every week, and we should be strict on ourselves in order to keep this time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must redeem the time, the opportunity, for the sake of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some may wonder whether or not it is possible to give two hours each week.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not be concerned about this; we only need to be strict with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Just consider how much time is wasted with idle talk.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we truly love the Lord, we will set aside a specific time each week for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Additionally, we should spend two hours each week to care for the saints whose condition is weaker than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we do this, we will spend two hours a week caring for unbelievers and two hours caring for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This means that, in addition to the meetings, we should set aside four hours each week to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we do this, many will be led to salvation, and many will be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Because we waste our time, the Bible speaks of redeeming the time Eph 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In this verse the Greek word translated time implies opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Opportunities are hard to come by, so we need to seize every favorable opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is to redeem the time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When Paul says that we should present our body, the first implication of his word is that we should set aside our time.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The second implication of presenting our body is that we need to be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The most practical part of our being is our body.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our spirit may be very living, but a living spirit cannot engage in practical things all by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Even the thoughts in our mind cannot produce practical things apart from the involvement of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our body is needed in order to do practical things related to a burning spirit and a renewed mind.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the past some brothers who did not practically meet with us would say, I am sorry that I cannot bear the responsibility with you in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I will stand with you in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the beginning I appreciated this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But eventually I realized that these words were not practical, so I said, Brother, if you truly stand with me, come with me.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you do not come with me, your words mean little.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Presenting our body requires service that is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There are seven days in a week, and we should set aside four hours a week to preach the gospel and care for the saints.</S>
