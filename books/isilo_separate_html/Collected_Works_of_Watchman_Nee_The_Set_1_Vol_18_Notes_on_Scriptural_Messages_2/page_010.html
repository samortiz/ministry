Sometimes good intentions can be misunderstood as bad intentions, or love can be misunderstood as hatred. There are many undesirable things in this world, and being misunderstood is certainly one of them. However, the most misunderstood One in the whole world is God! The misunderstanding we experience is only a fraction of what God experiences. He is the most misunderstood One in the whole world!</P><P>I read a story in the newspaper a few days ago. There was a so-called pastor who was a very aged man. One day he met a young man on the street who said, "Oh, a terrible thing has happened to me!" While he was speaking, tears began to fall. The pastor asked him what was the matter. He replied, "Terrible!" and then he cried. When the young man was asked again, he brought out a letter from his pocket and said, "This was mailed to me from a lawyer." The pastor asked, "Have you read it?" He answered, "Not yet. I dare not read it because I am afraid something unusual has happened. Lawyers' notices never bring good news." The pastor replied, "Read the letter, and find out what has happened." The young man answered, "It is bad luck for anyone to receive a letter from a lawyer. I do not like to receive a lawyer's letter." The pastor offered, "Well, let me read it for you." The young man agreed. After the pastor read the letter, he asked the young man, "You really have not read this letter?" The young man replied, "No." The pastor then told him, "This letter is to notify you that one of your relatives has died and left you an inheritance. The executor is at a certain place now, and you may go there and receive more than twenty thousand dollars." Brothers and sisters, our attitude toward God is just like this young man's. When we hear the name God, we do not like it and feel uneasy. It seems as if God is hard to deal with and does not have good intentions toward men. There are two groups of people sitting here today. One group has heard about God and believed in the Lord Jesus. The other group has not believed in God and in the Lord Jesus. I know that those who have believed can give a testimony that before they believed in God, the very name God or Jesus would make them unhappy. They were like the young man who did not want to read the lawyer's letter. But after they truly believed, they all wished that they had believed earlier. The profit one receives in believing in Jesus is far better than receiving an inheritance. What God has said is much better than what the lawyer said to the young man. God's Word tells us that those who believe in the Lord Jesus will go to heaven and have eternal life. I also can give the same testimony. Today the first thing I will exhort you to do is not be afraid of hearing about God. Do not think that God has bad intentions toward you. If you are willing to listen and if you hear what I say, you will know what kind of God He is.</P><P>A number of years ago, as I was preaching in Southeast Asia, I met a child. I told him to believe in Jesus. He said, "Mr. Nee, I can be friends with you, but believing in Jesus is not a good thing to do." When I met him the second time I again asked him to believe in Jesus. He answered me the same way. I then asked him why he thought this way. He said, "I had a brother who believed in Jesus when he was six years old, and then he died. If I believe in Jesus and then die just like my brother, what good is it to me?" Oh, he misunderstood God! How did he misunderstand God? He misunderstood God's heart! Please close your eyes and think for a moment about how you view God? You may think God has a black face and is evil and strict. You may think that God wants to see man sin and go to hell. What is your idea about God?</P><P>Once I met a relative of mine. He had a Ph.D. and was a professor at Manchuria University. I exhorted him to believe in the Lord Jesus at that time. He said, "Your God is not good. Your God does nothing good in heaven. From heaven He records the evil deeds of this person and that person. He does it like bookkeeping, and He uses this book to judge and condemn people to hell. Your God does not have a good heart. All He does in heaven is record the evil deeds of all kinds of people. His heart is very devious, and He wishes men to go to hell." Oh, he misunderstood God! He misunderstood God's heart. You may think, "God hates me. He does not want me to be saved; He is anxiously waiting to condemn me and bring me to perdition; He wants me to go to hell." However, I must tell you today that I know my God! My message today is to tell you one thing; if you really understand the message, you will not give up this God. Now I beg you to listen to the Word of God.</P><P>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world"! God is love. Please pay attention: God is love! It is so wonderful that God is not only thinking about you, caring for you, paying attention to you, and being merciful to you, He also loves you. A few days ago I was strolling in a park and met a classmate of mine. I asked him to believe in Jesus. I continually exhorted him, but he would not accept. In the end I almost burst into tears. If he only knew how loving God is toward him! Men very easily misunderstand God's love! You might think, "What kind of God is this God? Does He want to save me? Can He save a person like me?" Men are always full of doubts. But God not only is merciful toward you, He not only cares for you and pays attention to you, He also loves you. Throughout the ages, the most difficult thing God has done is love men. After man sinned, the first thing God did was love. God is full of good intention toward men. He is anxious for men to be saved. You may think that He is fierce and vicious and that He likes to see you far away from Him. But God gave us this book, the Bible, the Word of God, which tells us that God is love! Even though you are a sinner, God loves you. Even though you are far away from God, He loves you. Time after time, God sent His servants to tell men about His intentions. He said, "Can a woman forget her nursing child, / That she would not have compassion on the son of her womb? / Even though they may forget, / Yet I will not forget you" (Isa. 49:15). Oh, He so loved us. He once used a good illustration: "If a man divorces his wife / And she goes from him / And becomes another man's wife, / Will he return to her again? / Will not that land be / Utterly polluted? But you have committed fornication with many lovers. / Yet return to Me" (Jer. 3:1). Oh, God is so willing to accept sinners. But men do not believe that God loves the world. They always doubt that God can be so nice. But I have to say that God is love! God so loved the world that He decided that He Himself would come to the earth and become flesh in order to show men His love.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
