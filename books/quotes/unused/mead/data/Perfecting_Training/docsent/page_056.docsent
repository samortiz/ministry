   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO EXTREMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Two extremes can be seen in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One school is the Pentecostals who are too active.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They believe that their fasting and different kinds of maneuverings can accomplish everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although God may have no intention to heal someone, they think if they fast and pray, eventually their fasting and prayer would heal this person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why they invented a lot of false healings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After fasting for three days and praying for seven days, there must be some healing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So they just manufactured healing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was there and I studied it thoroughly, and I can tell you that very few of the healings are genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is the same with their tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most of their tongue-speaking is also humanly manufactured.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After fasting for tongues, they have to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the tongues didn t come, they told people to turn their jaw and to exercise their tongue; then a tongue came.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What kind of tongue is this?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is humanly manufactured.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I m not criticizing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am strong in this matter because I was there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I studied it; I was in it; I practiced it; and I discovered all kinds of human manufacture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Pentecostal school may be considered at the south pole.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another school may be considered at the north pole.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They teach people not to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They tell them they don t need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This also is to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The scriptural way is neither at the south pole nor at the north pole.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is midway.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is neither active nor passive; it is active-passive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To say this is easy, and to demonstrate it also is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But to get into the practicality takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you first begin to practice certain things, they may seem to be very strenuous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when you get into the experience your practice becomes so natural.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you practice playing ball, your skill of playing ball becomes very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In principle it is the same spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>NOT COMMANDING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Four or five years ago I would not have given you such a message.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I learned these things over thirty years ago, but I would not release a message like this until I saw the right situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now I feel the time is right, and many of you need this message.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you consider that my word is quite discouraging, it means you are not qualified to hear it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This word is not discouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This word is just to give you a timely help to bring you into the spiritual, natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I don t mean you shouldn t pray, and I don t mean you shouldn t read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, you should pray a lot, and you should read the Word a lot, but don t be the boss.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let the Lord be the boss.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You don t realize that in your spiritual seeking you give the Lord a lot of commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your prayer is a kind of commanding, and your study of the Word is a kind of commanding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You fast because you are commanding the Lord to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even in your prayer concerning living Christ, you may be giving a kind of command to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You are commanding Him to live Christ for you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Gradually, you will see that your command doesn t work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He does not and He would not honor your command.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why you can testify that the more you pray the worse you are.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is because the Lord would not honor this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day you will simply say, Lord, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I surely would like to live You, but I cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lord, I won t do it and I can t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even, Lord, You don t have the intention for me to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But, Lord, I m here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the kind of prayer the Lord is wanting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then from morning till evening you will be such a person telling the Lord that you love Him, that you want Him, that you surely would like to live Him, but that you wouldn t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Last year we began to talk about living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I know that many of you have prayed about this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Have you had any success?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I believe that you have all gotten bothered because the more you prayed, the more you couldn t live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some of you may have considered that since I said no other way works, that probably this way doesn t work either.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As long as you are giving the commandment, this way doesn t work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It doesn t work until one day you don t care for the practice of the one spirit, nor do you care for not practicing the one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You only care that you love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You don t care for living Christ nor do you care for not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You only care that you love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You would tell the Lord, Lord, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I love to be one spirit with You, and I love living You, but, dear Lord, I wouldn t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Lord, I just love You.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When you reach this stage, spontaneously you will have a life that lives Christ from morning till evening.</S>
