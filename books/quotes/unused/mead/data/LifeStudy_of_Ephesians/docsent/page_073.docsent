   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The phrase in spirit is found in every chapter of Ephesians, except chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you realize what is in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may say that the Lord Jesus and the Spirit of God are in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This, of course, is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But now we need to see that the new man is also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s habitation, His dwelling place, is in our spirit 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In type, the ancient city of Jerusalem was God s dwelling place, but today God s dwelling place is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our regenerated spirit is today s Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may think that there is no comparison between the city of Jerusalem and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jerusalem was a large city, and our spirit is very small.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if you know the Bible, you will realize that our spirit today is much larger than Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our spirit is universally spacious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem is that we are too individualistic and think only of our individual spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when the Bible speaks of your spirit, it includes the spirits of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For too long our mind has been preoccupied by natural concepts, religious thoughts, and traditional teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In considering the matter of our spirit, we need to drop all this and see that our spirit is universally spacious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know that God dwells in the third heaven, but He also dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This makes our spirit today s Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hallelujah for that wonderful entity in the universe called our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit witnesses with our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The words our spirit include Paul s spirit, Martin Luther s spirit, John Wesley s spirit, Brother Nee s spirit, your spirit, and my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How spacious our spirit is!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible reveals that God is the God of our spirit Num 16:22; Heb 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where is God today?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where is God s dwelling place today?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Where is the one new man?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE SPIRIT DIRECTING OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way to put on the new man is for our spirit which is mingled with the Spirit , in which are found God, God s dwelling place, and the new man, to become the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our mind dominates and directs our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the spirit to become the spirit of our mind means that the spirit directs, controls, dominates, and possesses our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of our mind being the mind of our spirit, our spirit should be the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the mind is the mind of our spirit, it means that our mind dominates, controls, and directs our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if our spirit is the spirit of our mind, it means that our spirit dominates, controls, and directs our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the spirit directs our mind, it governs our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When this is the case, our being is under the control of our spirit, in which are found God, the dwelling place of God, and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is in this spirit of our mind that we are renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By means of this spirit we put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How much we put on the new man depends on how much our spirit directs our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When our spirit dominates and directs us, there is no ground for opinions or ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no room for our way, because our whole being is dominated, controlled, governed, and directed by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A GRADUAL PROCESS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Putting on the new man does not take place once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the contrary, it is a lifelong matter, a gradual process that goes on throughout our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have pointed out again and again that the new man has been created in Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 2:15, the Greek word rendered in has an instrumental significance; it also means with.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, in Himself actually means with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The new man has already been created with Christ as the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we were regenerated, this new man was put into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now day by day we need to put on this new man by permitting the spirit to control our being and renew our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every time part of our being is renewed, we put on a little more of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, the more we are renewed through the spirit controlling our mind, the more of the new man we put on.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually, this process of putting on the new man will be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>CHRIST IS ALL</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the one new man there are none of the national and cultural distinctions between the peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here there is neither Jew nor Gentile, bondman nor freeman, cultured nor uncultured Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Likewise, there is no American, nor British, nor Japanese, nor Chinese, nor German, nor French.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this new man Christ is all because He is the very essence with which the new man is created.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, the new man is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>CREATED ACCORDING TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because the new man has been created in Christ and with Christ according to God, the new man bears the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In contrast to Genesis 1:26, which says that man was made in the image of God, Ephesians 4:24 says that the new man is created directly according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eventually, the new man will bear the image of God in holiness and righteousness of the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By being renewed in the governing spirit of our mind, we put on this new man that has been created in Christ Jesus.</S>
