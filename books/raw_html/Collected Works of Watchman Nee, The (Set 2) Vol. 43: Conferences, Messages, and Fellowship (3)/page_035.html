<h2 class="head1">HEALING THROUGH FAITH</h2><p>In 1929 I lived in a place about two hours away from the city of Foochow. At that time we had a sister who had a very serious eye disease. She went to Foochow to seek medical help. The doctor told her that her eye disease was very serious and that even if it was healed, she would need eyeglasses. The doctor prescribed a pair of glasses for her and gave her some treatments. One day she heard me speak on the truth concerning faith and she believed. She went to the Lord and said, "My eye disease is very serious. Every day I have to go to Foochow for treatment. Even if I am healed, I will still have to wear glasses for the rest of my life. It is time consuming as well as expensive." She asked God to heal her. After she prayed, she believed that God healed her eye disease, and that she had already been healed. She was full of joy and peace.</p><p>However, she remembered the appointment that she had already made with the doctor. What should she do since Christians should not break a promise? The glasses prescribed to her could not be resold to someone else. Therefore, she went to Foochow as scheduled. They gave her medicine for her eyes and the glasses. On the way home on the ferry, she thought to herself, "If I believe God's promise that He has healed my eyes, what am I going to do with this medicine and glasses?" Within her there was a desire to take these items home so that she could still use them in case her condition did not improve. However, another voice said, "Do you believe that God has already healed you? If you do, what is the use of these items?" Satan also began to talk to her: "You should not be too hasty in doing things. You have already spent so much money on these things." She knew that this speaking was from Satan, and she began to praise God. At the same time, she threw the drugs and eyeglasses into the river. Her heart became very joyous. She later testified that she had never been so happy in her whole life. A week later her eyesight was restored.</p><p>One day she stood up to give her testimony. A few days later I heard another story. Another brother who heard her testimony also had eye problems and was also treated by the same doctor. The doctor gave him medicine and also prescribed glasses for him. After he heard the sister's testimony, he went to Foochow. On his way back he said to himself, "If God can heal that sister, He can also heal me." He tried to believe in this way, and he threw the medicine and glasses into the river. When he came back, he told Brother Faithful Luk that surely God would heal him.</p><p>One day Brother Luk came to my place and told me that the brother had grown in faith and that he was not seeking treatment for his disease anymore. When I heard it I smiled coldly and said, "The eye disease of that sister was surely healed, but I guarantee that this brother will not get better." Brother Luk said, "How can that be?" I said, "Perhaps you should take him back to the doctor." Brother Luk said, "You are just too much." I said, "This brother does not have faith." He said, "How can you say that, when this brother threw away items worth twenty dollars? He has even stopped going to the doctor and discontinued the medicine. If this is not faith, what is it?" After four weeks, the eye disease of the brother had not improved; in fact, it deteriorated. He came to see me and asked why God had healed the sister but not him. I said, "You threw away your things too soon. You do not have faith." He said, "But I believe that God will surely heal me." He told me that God had called him to preach the gospel in Ku-Tien and that when he returned God would heal him. I said, "When you return, please come and see me." When he returned, he was not any better. From 1929 until now (1937), he has been wearing a pair of thick glasses and is still seeing the doctor because he did not have faith.</p><h2 class="head1">A LIVING FAITH TOWARD GOD'S WORD</h2><p>A living faith is not one that believes that God will heal but one that believes that God has already healed. It is not believing that God will listen to prayer but believing that God has already answered prayer. Whenever we believe that God has already answered our prayer, we have received it. The brother believed that God would heal him from the very first day, but that kind of faith is useless. There is only one kind of faith in the Bible: "Believe that you have received them, and you will have them." The Bible does not say that we will receive at a later date. It is useless to believe that we can or will receive. Friends, will, can, and may are terrible words. A living faith has no use for these words. Words of faith are have and already; no other words should be used. Concerning our being in Christ, we have to realize that we overcome as soon as we believe, just as we were saved as soon as we believed. All of the riches of Christ, all of the heavenly blessings, the power of healing, the outpouring of the Spirit, and the power of the Spirit can be ours. Whenever we receive a word from the Lord and take hold of it, believing that it is ours, it is ours. Faith apart from God's word is not real faith; it is useless and ineffectual. We must have God's word before we can believe. Both Romans 8:2 and 6:6 are God's word. If we hold on to God's word and believe His word, we will receive! The Lord Jesus said, "All things that you pray and ask." How all-inclusive is this word! Everything is included in this word. Believe and we will receive! All of God's promises, the rich promises and the accomplished facts, are ours when we believe. May God grant us the light to see what living faith is and what believing is&mdash;not a kind of false believing but a genuine believing. Once we have this kind of faith, our most difficult problems will be resolved immediately. This is the first lesson we have to learn. The blessing it brings is unlimited and sufficient for our whole lifetime. May God bless us!</p>
