<h2 class="head1">OUR BASIC VISION BEING<br />
THE DEEP MYSTERY IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Lord has shown us a vision. This vision includes not only the revelation on the surface of the Bible but also the deep mystery in the Bible. The revelation on the surface of the Bible can be understood by anyone. In order to understand the mystery in the depth of the Bible, however, we must be enlightened by God, and we need much experience. Without light and experience, it is hard to see the mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>The deep mystery in the Bible is related to God, because God is a mystery. The universe that He created also is a mystery. Throughout the ages questions related to the meaning of the universe and the purpose of man&rsquo;s existence have been unresolved. The Bible reveals that the Lord Jesus was the most excellent person in human history. No historian can understand the Lord Jesus or describe Him thoroughly. Thus, the Lord Jesus is a mystery. The Bible speaks of an additional matter that is related to the meaning of the universe and to the meaning of human existence. This matter is the church.</p>
<p>The meaning of the word <em>church</em> is the &ldquo;assembly of the called-out ones.&rdquo; There are millions of people in the world, but only a small number believe in the Lord Jesus, have been cleansed by His precious blood, and have been regenerated by the Spirit. These ones have been called and separated by God. When they gather together, they are the assembly of the called ones. Before Christianity came to China, the term <em>called-out assembly</em> was not used in ancient Chinese literature. The word <em>church</em> was translated in Chinese as &ldquo;religious assembly.&rdquo; The word <em>religious</em> is not appropriate. The phrase <em>called-out assembly</em> is much better than <em>religious assembly.</em> We are the called-out assembly. However, the term <em>called-out assembly</em> cannot fully explain the meaning of this mystery. The church is a true mystery.</p>
<p>God is a mystery, the universe is a mystery, Christ is a mystery, and the church is a mystery. Those who want to know these mysteries must read the Bible. Regrettably, people do not see these mysteries even after reading the Bible many times. Those who read the Bible know that God created the heavens and the earth and that man sinned. They also know that God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to accomplish redemption for man. It is easy to see these things in the Bible, but it is not easy to see the mystery of God, the mystery of the universe, or the mystery of Christ. People see the Christ who is on the surface of the Bible, but they do not see the mystery of Christ; they do not see the church as a mystery. They can see what is on the surface but not the deep things. They can see the revelation on the surface, but they do not have a vision of the mystery. In the past decades God has opened the Bible and given us a vision of this mystery.</p>
<p>The mystery of God is Christ; Christ is the mystery of God. If we want to know God, we must come to Christ. When we find Christ, we find God. When we know Christ, we know God. Who is God? If we want to know God, we must look at Christ, because Christ is the definition, explanation, meaning, and expression of God. All that God is, all that He does, and all that He has dwell in Christ. Everything related to God dwells in Christ. Christ is the embodiment of God; hence, to know Christ is to know God. Christ was born a man, He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, was crucified, and rose from the dead. Now He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). After passing through such a process, Christ has been manifested as the mystery of God. Now we know how to contact God. All that God is, has, and does are in Christ and expressed through Christ. Christ is the mystery of God.</p>
