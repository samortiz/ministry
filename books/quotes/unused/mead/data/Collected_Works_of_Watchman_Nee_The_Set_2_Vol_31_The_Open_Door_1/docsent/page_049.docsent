   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 Two letters from Lungkow for Ms. Chang Jia-yu.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2 One letter from Hsinchih for Miss Lo Jing-hwei.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3 One card from Chen Kuo-yang of Ch'ang-sha for Mr. Rui Di-min.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>4 One letter from Singapore for Brother David Hsu.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>RECEIVING AND FORWARDING LETTERS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is difficult to correspond with co-workers in various regions because no one knows where they are or will be.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are willing, therefore, to serve the brothers in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you have a letter you want us to forward, please send it c/o P. O. Box 84, Hankow, and we will forward it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many brothers and sisters are moving around during these difficult times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have a letter you want us to forward, please send it to Brother Lan Tsi-yi, Gospel Court, Lane 1, Hsiao-Dong-Jia, Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please write the return address on the outside of the envelope.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We printed one thousand copies of the first issue of this publication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because there are brothers and sisters who still do not know what our goal is in putting this publication out, we quote two paragraphs from Mr. Watchman Nee's An Open Letter:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For years I have felt the need of a publication which could be used to communicate news of the work in all of the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A local newsletter belongs to a particular locality and serves a particular church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But we need a paper for the intercommunication of news which will serve all the localities, that is, one which will serve the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The name, The Open Door, was chosen much earlier, and I had hoped that others would be raised up by the Lord to bear its responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was my hope because, on the one hand, there is the need, and on the other hand, my special stand makes it impossible for me to undertake the task myself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this had been undertaken by someone else, it would have been merely personal and done by someone who was gifted to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if I were to do it, it would become official and would be based on my position.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, in order to avoid this, I dared not move for years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I never believed that this newspaper would be issued under this kind of circumstance, at this time, and in this place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now I must do what I did not wish to do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, please keep in mind always, brothers, that this is a personal ministry and not the instrument of an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If any co-worker or church in any locality is unwilling to see their news appear in this publication, please say so in order that none might be offended in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I do wish that I could receive news from all the localities so that those who are concerned for you could make intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The letters in this issue have already clearly described the itineraries of the co-workers, so we did not make a separate column.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is difficult for the post office to deliver the mail.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A letter that is not sent by airmail usually takes more than a month to reach its destination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, some letters that are sent later arrive first and some that are sent earlier arrive later.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Printed matter is even slower.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, letters with important matters should be sent by airmail, if possible, c/o P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may not be able to always get every issue of this publication into the hands of the brothers and sisters, so please pay attention to the points mentioned in the previous issues.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will repeat them again:</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1 Date your letters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Write the return address clearly and in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Include the name of the province.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2 Please notify us immediately if your address changes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a battle occurs in an area, we do not know where the brothers and sisters have fled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is no communication, we really worry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We also do not want to send things to the wrong address.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After reading Brother Hsu Jung-jieh's letter in this issue, we thank the Lord for him on the one hand, and we must pray for him on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is easy to talk about many things, but you will feel the frustration only when you are put in his kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we remember them in our heart often.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yeh-Ji Village does not handle money transfers, so if there are any offerings for them in the future, it would be best to send them in care of Mr. Huang Chung in the Customs Office in K'un-ming, Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Watchman Nee said in the first issue, "Actually, to go to the inland regions under the present circumstances is more difficult and more unsure than before.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we should trust in God rather than men and should know that our provision and protection are from heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we hope that the brothers and sisters would not draw back because of the difficulties which the brothers and sisters have encountered in pioneering in the distant regions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the contrary, we must rise up at the news and pursue on.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we sing the hymn, "Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas?" what effect does it have on our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Should we not say to the Lord, "In the name, the precious name, of Him who died for me, Through grace I'll win the promised crown, Whate'er my cross may be."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This publication is being edited in Chungking and printed and mailed out in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot predict how long the editors will be here.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, news of the work and the churches should still be sent to the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Localities that have access to airmail can send letters in the near future directly to Ruth Lee, c/o Mrs. Yuan, 4-3 Shang Chang Chia Garden, Chungking, Szechuan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ruth Lee</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>January 26, 1938, in Chungking</S>
