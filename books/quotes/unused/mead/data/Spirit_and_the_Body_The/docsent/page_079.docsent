   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR MUTUAL CARE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point, I would like to say a word about mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 25 Paul says, "The members should have mutual care one for another" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>. In the Body we must have a mutual care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul goes on to say, "And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it" v. 26 . This is mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to learn to have such a mutual care not only in our private life, home life, and daily life, but also in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I need to care for you, and you need to care for me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I speak often and you do not speak at all, it is an indication that you do not care for me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To exercise mutual care means to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you speak in the meetings, it means you have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Often the elders are cruel and merciless to me, for they sit in the meeting and expect me to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, I have frequently said, "Brothers, please be merciful to me and do something.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose we are members of a team.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If I am the only one who plays in the game and you do not play, you are very cruel to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if you have mercy on me, you will care for me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who do not function in the meetings are cruel; they have no mercy on others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some brothers desire to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because they have never been an elder, the thought of eldership is so pleasant to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if they were to get into the yoke of eldership, they would see how demanding it is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, many elders desire to be released from the yoke of eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most of the saints in the churches are cruel and merciless to the elders in that they do not help to bear the burden in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the meetings, they allow the whole burden, perhaps many tons in weight, to rest upon the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some saints seem to have even made a secret agreement not to alleviate the suffering of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps an elder's wife is the only one who has mercy on him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the elders suffer in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In some meetings the elders bear such a heavy burden that they are slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates the lack of mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, sometimes the elders do not exercise mutual care either, for they may dominate the meeting and maneuver it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although some elders are suffering, others are enjoying their maneuvering of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the saints are little "lambs," but these elders are big "donkeys."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a very serious matter, because such maneuvering annuls the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of the Body life, there is the display of the activity of one "donkey."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once again we see that for the practicality of the Body life we must exercise mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Often in the meetings I have had the burden to call a hymn or to offer praise or a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But because I was caring for others, I did not do so.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I did not want to maneuver the meeting or be a "donkey" among "lambs."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some elders, however, are such big "donkeys" that in the meeting you can see no one but them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a sign of the absence of mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Body is manifested in a church meeting in a practical way, the mutual care will be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both in our private life and in our meeting life, we must practice this mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must care for others and create a situation which encourages all to function.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we shall have the Body life in a practical way.</S>
