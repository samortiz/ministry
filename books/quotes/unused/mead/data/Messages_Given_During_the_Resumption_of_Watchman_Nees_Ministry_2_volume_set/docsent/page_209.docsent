   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE ASCERTAINING OF MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Witness Lee asked: How does a person know what kind of ministry he has?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Nee answered: It is better that he does not know.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether or not you have a ministry is up to the Head to know; it is not up to you to know.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason we have to accept the judgment of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the knowledge of the Body is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether you think you have a ministry or do not have a ministry does not count.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is useless for a brother or a sister to tell others in the meeting that he or she has a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you have a ministry, you have it, and it will be manifested through your exercising it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning the ascertaining of ministry, we have to realize that the judgment of the whole Body is more accurate than the judgment of an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CONCERNING PURSUING THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi asked: What kind of attitude should we take concerning the pursuit of the gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Ministry Being Constituted</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>of the Death of Jesus,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>whereas the Gifts Being Bestowed upon Us Outwardly by the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee answered: First and Second Corinthians tell us the difference between the gift and the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians is on the gifts, whereas 2 Corinthians is on the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The basis of the ministry is the death and life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A gift is merely a power that the Holy Spirit bestows outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word "death" in 2 Corinthians 4 is a special word in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is more than one word for death in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One of them means the opposite of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is used to describe a person as being dead, as opposed to being alive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the word commonly used.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another word means a kind of killing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is used in the sense of killing a person, as opposed to begetting a person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The death in 2 Corinthians 4 has the sense of killing in the Greek language.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, it can be translated as the killing or the slaying of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While I was in London, I told the Western brothers and sisters that for the word death in 2 Corinthians 4, we can use a new word deathize.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This death is a death that kills you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What this is saying is that the positive death of Jesus is being wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It refers to that death which issues from Jesus and which causes us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A ministry of life comes from God and is produced through repeated dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Spiritual gifts, on the other hand, are but elementary matters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What the Lord cares for today is that we serve the church with the ministry, and not with the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Church Needing Life Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>More Than Spiritual Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The minute a brother stands up to speak, one can tell right away whether he is a brother with a gift or a brother with a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Southeast Asia, men cut the rubber tree with a knife.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The life of the tree flows out through the scar of the knife-wound.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a picture of one who serves with a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a man passes through fiery trials, he can give life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is very different from merely giving gifts to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to have a strong church, what we need is not gifts, but the ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you walk into an immature church, there may be much activity, but there is not much life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, you may see a brother who is not eloquent; you may be concerned for him and may wonder if you should do his job for him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet with him, there is the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is manifested in him is not the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a church is mature, many ministries will be produced, and there will be much life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every brother should learn to touch the difference between gift and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church needs more ministries to be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An immature church requires the presence of gifted brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we cannot allow such a situation to go on forever.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Gifts are temporary, whereas ministries last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Gifts Being What One Uses,</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>whereas Ministry Being the Person Himself</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Yu's fellowship: The life of Christ is His deposit within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This life is a real entity from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is a reality from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Gift is only a thing; one can borrow it and use it for a while, but the user may not know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is like Balaam's donkey speaking human words; one cannot say that because of this, the donkey has become human.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who exercise gifts are like children speaking grown-up words.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God has raised up some people with a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, they have to have the gifts, because otherwise they cannot do the work of perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, those who speak merely according to their gifts are entirely different from those who speak according to a ministry that is produced in the course of twenty years or more.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some say, "If others can speak, why can't I?"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The problem is that while a child can speak grown-up words, he does not therefore become a grown-up.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is like the donkey who can speak human words; it does not mean that the donkey can consider itself a human being just because it speaks human words.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Outwardly, the speaking of those with gifts and the speaking of those with a ministry are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But inwardly, the two are different.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When a church is strong, the spirit of the saints is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although there may not be many outward activities, men will learn the proper lessons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When a church is young, there may be the gifts, but there will not be the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we know God, we will see that a person may say something, but this does not mean that he is what he says.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some gifted ones fall much faster and easier than those who have no gifts.</S>
