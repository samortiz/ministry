   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All of these factors have caused us to reconsider the Lord's move in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's recovery first spread to Europe in 1971.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not allow Europe to be lost, but neither should we do anything in a quick way according to our natural thought.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to pray much and consider much.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The recovery must spread.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are three factors that run the entire world today: the leadership of the United States, the influence from Europe, and the influence from Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord sent His recovery to the United States because this is the leading nation in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of the English language and the leadership of this nation, the Lord's recovery has spread quickly in the past quarter of a century.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the world situation has changed, and the Lord's move will probably follow the pattern of this change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must take some practical steps.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From now on, we will add French, German, and Russian classes to our full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, we will encourage saints to give themselves for the Lord's purpose to spread His recovery to the European countries, especially to eastern Germany and Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should go not as individuals; we should go as a team of at least four, including a couple of age thirty or older as the core of the team.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This team may go to one of the larger cities in Europe with large universities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will start the recovery work mainly on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We hope to rent houses that can be used to take care of weekend guests and can be used as meeting places.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If some are ready now to go as such a team, they may go right away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may first strengthen the ministry in England because eventually England will be crucial for all of Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What the saints do when they go to Europe depends upon their leading from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may go full-time for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others may take a job.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Soon there will be more business transactions between the United States and Germany, and more job opportunities will open up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may go and enroll in school.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, all should have the purpose of going for the spreading of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our full-time training, we will have a class for preparing those who will go to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then some will go as teams.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will not practice the old things there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will go to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All this will be without any official organization.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It will be the saints' move according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I believe that all the churches will rise up to participate in this matter, especially in the financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no need to worry about finances.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The saints should go by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The practical things will be taken care of by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To support one brother in Russia for the Lord's recovery will not cost very much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If some go to Russia, the churches will easily be able to support them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some of the co-workers should also be encouraged to go to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should send not only some "soldiers" but also some co-workers to bear the burden for the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are preparing to go to Europe, we should become acquainted with the way to get sinners saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If one goes as an English-speaking student, he will be able to associate with the German students there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He will pick up the language very quickly, and within a year he should be able to preach to the students.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some need to tell the Lord that they will go to Europe for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps soon we will send teams, but we must not treat this lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must receive the Lord's leading with much consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not say that we cannot go because we are not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church in Jerusalem was very young, but the saints there were scattered for the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many useful brothers in this country who have gained much of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They need a place to use their capacity and to have it developed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Close to two hundred American saints received training in Taipei, Irving, and Anaheim, but when they returned to their localities, they could not develop their capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This does not mean that the churches are opposing the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the churches today welcome the new way, but the situation does not afford much opportunity for the full development of the saints' capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we must spread by migration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If some remain in the United States, they will not be very useful, but if they go to Europe, they will become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who are burdened should contact the leading brothers for fellowship.</S>
