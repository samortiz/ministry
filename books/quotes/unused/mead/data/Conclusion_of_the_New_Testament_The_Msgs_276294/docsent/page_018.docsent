   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY-ONE EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS 17</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in chapters nine and ten of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>60.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Light and the Healer of the Blind</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter nine presents Christ as the light and the Healer of the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>a. The Light</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus is the light of the world to give sight to the blind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Blindness, like sin in chapter eight, is a matter of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A dead person surely is blind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, they need the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ to shine upon them 2 Cor 4:4 to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God Acts 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The man whose eyes were opened by the Lord Jesus in John 9 was born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This signifies that blindness is in the nature of a person when he is born.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We sinners were blind by nature because we were born that way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, a person needs not only to confess that he is sinful but also admit that he is blind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To the blind man in John 9 the Lord Jesus, as the light of the world, imparted sight in the way of life 10:10b, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord Jesus saw this blind man, He said, While I am in the world, I am the light of the world 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is the light of life 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Blindness comes from the shortage of the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every dead person is also a blind person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone who is spiritually dead is also spiritually blind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The blindness in John 9, therefore, indicates the lack of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have the divine life, we will have sight, for the light of life opens our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus first pointed out that the blind man needed the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 9 we see that there is a connection between light and blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Blindness not only indicates death but also denotes darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Gospel of John, blindness issues in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you were blind, you would be in darkness, unable to see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to 1 John darkness also causes blindness: He who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, blindness causes darkness; on the other hand, darkness causes blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the Gospel of John, blindness comes first and then darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 9 blindness equals darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the blind man in this chapter needs Christ as the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Healer of the Blind</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is not only the light of the world v. 5 to give sight to the blind; He is also the Healer of the blind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1 The Words out of His Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mingling with Humanity to Bring Sight to the Blind</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can the light come into us, who were born blind?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to verse 6, in order for the light to come into us, we need the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The words out of the Lord s mouth signified by His spittle , being the anointing Spirit 6:63 , mingle with humanity signified by the clay to bring sight to the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we would understand this, we need to know the significance of the clay, the spittle, and the anointing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In John 9:6, after the Lord Jesus spoke of Himself as being the light of the world, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the blind man s eyes with the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Clay here, as in Romans 9:21, signifies humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Clay signifies the natural man, the man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As those created by God, we all are clay.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Spittle here, as something that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord Matt 4:4 , signifies the Lord s words, which are Spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord s making clay of the spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord s living word, which is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word anointed in John 9:6 proves this, because the Lord s Spirit is the anointing Spirit Luke 4:18; 2 Cor 1:21-22; 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here the Lord Jesus anointed the blind eyes with the clay made of His spittle, that they might have sight.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This signifies that by the anointing of the mingling of the Lord s word which is His Spirit with our humanity, our eyes, which were blinded by Satan, can have sight.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to be deeply impressed with the significance of the mingling of the clay with the spittle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our humanity clay is mingled with the element of the Lord in His word spittle .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that the Lord mingles His element with us by and with His word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that the clay has received something that has proceeded out the Lord s mouth and has been mingled with it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This mingling of divinity with humanity is the most prevailing ointment, and no other ointment can surpass it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to John 6 the anointing of the Spirit follows the mingling of the Lord in His word with the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From experience we know that immediately after we receive the Lord through His word, we have the anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As a result our blindness is healed, and we receive our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now we can see how the light of the world, Jesus Christ, can come into a person who was born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The light of the world comes into a blind man through the mingling of the life-giving Spirit with his being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to come into us, Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now as the Spirit He is able to come into us and mingle with us and anoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the significance of the clay, the spittle, and the anointing in this chapter.</S>
