   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE LEARNING OUR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES IN THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the dispensing of the Triune God, there are a few more crucial verses 2 Corinthians 13:14 and Revelation 1:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD VERSUS THE CULTIVATION OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The dispensing of the Triune God is the basic requirement for spiritual experiences We cannot be separated from this dispensing even for a single day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we stay away from the dispensing of the Triune God, our spiritual experiences are empty and worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to know that not only Chinese Confucianism has its so-called moral cultivation, but even the other religions in the world such as Hinduism and Buddhism also have their so-called moral cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In religion, self-mortification is a common practice, and moral cultivation is also considered necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, if a Christian pursues so-called spirituality apart from the dispensing of the Triune God, his pursuit is a kind of religious cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether in Buddhism, Hinduism, or Confucianism, the principle of seeking perfection in ethical pursuits is the same: it is the exercise of self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the positive side, this is to control one's emotions and to not do things according to the dictates of one's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the negative side, this is to restrain one's lusts and to not indulge oneself in sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wang Yang-ming was the most famous one among the moral cultivators of the different schools in China.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Catholic Church, the most well-known ones were the mystics, including Madame Guyon, F nelon, Brother Lawrence, and Thomas Kempis, who were raised up three hundred years ago and who all had their form of moral cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among this group of people, Madame Guyon was the most spiritual one; however, if you read her autobiography, you will find that she had a very strong will, within which there was a considerable measure of her own natural element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OUR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES NOT BEING ACCORDING TO THE FLESH BUT ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At its inception the Lord's recovery in China was deeply influenced by the mystics, especially in the experience of pursuing spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the first thirty years there was much exercise and practice in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later we found that without the Spirit, that kind of exercise is just like the practice of having strict, ascetic rules in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I use the expression "the Spirit," because today the light of revelation is very clear, showing us that the Spirit is the Triune God processed and dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Triune God who has been dispensed into us has an abbreviated title, or we may say a general title "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul wrote fourteen Epistles on the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in which he concluded that we must walk "by the Spirit" Gal 5:16, 25; Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not forget this word: our spiritual experiences are not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Romans 8:4 the word spirit denotes the mingled spirit, that is, our regenerated spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit to be one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this mingled spirit the main component is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today in the Lord's recovery we all know that this Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, and at the same time, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God and the ultimate reaching of the Triune God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once He reaches man, He enters into man's spirit to be mingled with man's spirit as one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the spirit referred to in Romans 8:4.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we do not walk according to anything other than such a mingled spirit.</S>
