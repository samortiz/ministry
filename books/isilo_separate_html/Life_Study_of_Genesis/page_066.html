The Way&#151;Genesis 2:7</H2><P>Now we proceed to consider the way in which God created man. God created man exactly like a bottle with a neck and a mouth. Praise the Lord that I have a mouth! How could I live without one? God made me this way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) To Form Man's Body<br>with the Dust of the Ground</H2><P>God formed man's body with the dust of the ground that man may have a body as his outward expression and as an organ to contact material things. God made man with dust, not with gold. Gold cannot produce life. If you sow seed into gold, you will waste the seed. Dust, however, can grow life. If you sow seed into the dust, the seed will grow. We are not a man of gold, but a man of dust. I am happy to be a man of dust. I am an earthen vessel. Hallelujah!</P><P>Our body was formed out of dust to be our outward expression. When I have the time, I like to look at myself in the mirror, especially examining my face. The more I look at myself, the more I am convinced that I was made by God. No other person in the whole universe can fashion such a wonderful creature. The style of American cars may be improved and changed every year, but no one can improve the design of a human being. Our ears have been perfectly designed for listening. How awkward it would be if the members of our body were relocated! What would happen if our nose were placed upon our forehead and turned upward? The rain and the dust would come in. God purposely designed the nose to be turned downward that only air may enter in. Although my nose is not very attractive, I am still fond of it. God designed it for me.</P><P>There are many things to consider about the human body. In Ecclesiastes 12:3 Solomon mentions the grinders, saying that when a man is old the grinders will cease because they are few. The grinding here refers to the grinding activity of our molars. The front teeth, the incisors, are the cutting teeth and the molars are the grinding teeth. When we eat a piece of meat, our front teeth cut it, and the tongue sends it to the molars where it is ground into a digestible substance. According to Ecclesiastes, the grinders cease because an older person usually has fewer teeth. Who designed us this way? Who designed our incisors, our molars, and the saliva that is secreted to liquefy the food? Surely God did this.</P><P>Man was created by God. He was designed by the best artist. Do not pay attention to the theory of evolution. Even medical science can confirm that the human body contains all the elements found in dust such as salt, sulfur, copper, and iron. God formed a wonderful human body out of this dust. I have no words to describe it. Look at yourself. Look at your shoulders, arms, and the five fingers on each hand. With the four fingers and a thumb man can do anything. What could we do if we had five thumbs on each hand? We could not even pick up our eating utensils. If you examine your human body, you will find that it is a living bottle. We were truly made by God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> </body></html>
