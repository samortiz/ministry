<h1 class="title">MATERIAL RICHES<br />
AND THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:19-34</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the fifth section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7, which concerns the material riches of the kingdom people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MATERIAL RICHES<br />
BEING RELATED TO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS</h2>
<p>After the Lord spoke concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people (6:1-18), He spoke concerning material riches (vv. 19-34). Righteous deeds are related to material riches because we must first settle the matter of material riches in order to have righteous deeds. No one has righteous deeds in a proper way without thoroughly settling the matter of material riches. According to a common Chinese saying, &ldquo;When one takes righteousness more seriously, he takes material riches more lightly.&rdquo; A person must choose between righteous deeds and material riches. If he thinks more highly of righteous deeds, he will spontaneously lightly esteem material riches. However, if he thinks more highly of material riches, he will lightly esteem righteous deeds.</p>
<p>When speaking about the righteous deeds of the kingdom people, the Lord first spoke of giving alms. This shows that righteous deeds are related to material riches because giving alms is the giving of material riches. If a person has not dealt with material riches, it is unlikely that he will be righteous in the giving of alms (vv. 1-4).</p>
<p>In verses 5 through 15 the Lord spoke concerning how to pray to God. Apparently, praying is not related to material riches; however, our experience shows that prayer and material riches are related. If a person loves material riches, he will depend on them, and his heart will be set on them. Consequently, he will not depend on God or pray to God. Whenever we rely on something other than God, we cannot pray. If we are looking for a job and know a reliable person who has connections, we will stop praying, or at best we will merely go through the motion of prayer. It is when we are hopeless that we are willing to pray desperately. Therefore, it is not easy for us to pray when we are rich, nor is it easy for us to pray when we depend on something or someone other than God. The more we lack and the more difficulties we face, the easier it is for us to pray. Therefore, if we want to pray, we must settle the matter of material riches.</p>
<p>In our human life material riches can replace God. Unbelievers take material riches as their god, and it is easy for Christians also to allow material riches to replace God. If we do not deal with material riches, it will be hard for God to gain ground in us. In order to follow the Lord as His disciples, we need to pay a price. To pay a price means to give up anything that replaces God and to receive God. Material riches are the greatest replacement of God. There is a common Chinese saying: &ldquo;Loving money as one&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; This shows how much material riches can replace God. It is difficult for someone who has not dealt with material riches in a proper way to have genuine prayers. Genuine prayers are for God&rsquo;s interest. The highest expression of our living for God is that we pray for His interest, not for ourselves. However, a person who loves and relies on material riches cannot pray for God&rsquo;s interest. In order to be righteous in the matter of prayer, we must address and deal with material riches.</p>
<p>The Lord also spoke concerning the righteous deed of fasting (vv. 16-18). To fast is to deal with a legitimate enjoyment. The principle of fasting refers not only to buffeting our body by not eating but also to our not being loose by limiting our spending on our needs and enjoyments in our living. For example, a brother might be able to spend one hundred dollars for a garment, but for the sake of the Lord and for the sake of his service, he limits his spending to only fifty dollars. This principle can also be applied to eating, housing, and transportation. The principle of fasting is also related to material riches. Therefore, the righteous deeds that the Lord spoke of are all related to material riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT STORING UP FOR OURSELVES<br />
TREASURES ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>In His first words concerning the material riches of the kingdom people, the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth&rdquo; (v. 19). The basic principle of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain is that we would be delivered from the self and not live for the self. Material riches are the best test for the self and the best expression of the self. Anyone who loves and treasures material riches and who cannot overcome material riches is filled with the self. This is why the Lord began by saying, &ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures.&rdquo; The thoroughness of our dealing with the self depends on how thoroughly we deal with material riches. If we do not store up treasures for ourselves, the Lord will gain more ground in our being, and the self will spontaneously decrease.</p>
<p>The Lord said that we should not store up for ourselves treasures on the earth. This shows that the self is related to the earth. The things that we plan for the self are things on the earth, not things in heaven. The more we plan for the self, the more we are earthly, not heavenly.</p>
<p>The Lord said that we should not store up for ourselves treasures on the earth, &ldquo;where moth and rust consume and where thieves dig through and steal&rdquo; (v. 19). The treasures that we store up on the earth will be consumed by moth and rust or will be stolen by thieves. To be consumed by moth means that our treasures are consumed by circumstances. To be consumed by rust means that our treasures are consumed of themselves. To be stolen by thieves means that our treasures are consumed by other people. Our treasures on the earth are unreliable. They are ours today, but they may no longer be ours tomorrow. Someone may store up treasures on the earth, but his treasures will be either consumed by rust, consumed by the environment, or stolen by others. Eventually, what we gain on the earth is mere vanity. Hence, the Lord said, &ldquo;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&rdquo; (v. 20).</p>
<p>Why did the Lord ask us to store up treasures in heaven? Is there a need for money in heaven? Of course, there is no need for money in heaven. There also was not a need for money in the garden of Eden. God did not create money. Money did not come from God; it came from the devil and belongs to the fallen and corrupted earth. Therefore, in Luke 16:9 the Lord referred to money as &ldquo;the mammon of unrighteousness.&rdquo; <em>Mammon of unrighteousness</em> does not mean that money comes from an unrighteous source. Rather, it means that money itself is unrighteous. If money is unrighteous, why did the Lord ask us to store up treasures in heaven? Furthermore, how can we store up treasures in heaven? The treasures that we store up on the earth are for ourselves, but the treasures that we store up in heaven are for God. The self is related to the earth, but God is related to heaven. The money that we store up on the earth is for ourselves, but the treasures that we store up in heaven are for God. In order for our material riches to be used by God, these material riches must be stored up in heaven now.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Principles of the Kingdom People &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
