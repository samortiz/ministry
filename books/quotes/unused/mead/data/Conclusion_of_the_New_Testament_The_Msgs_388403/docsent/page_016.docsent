   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED NINETY-THREE EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE EPISTLES 99 114.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>An Advocate</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 John 2:1-2 Christ is presented as an Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here Advocate is a translation of the Greek word parakletos, which is translated Comforter in John s Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>a. An Advocate with the Father,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus Christ the Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord is an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous v. 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 An Advocate</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Greek word rendered Advocate refers to one who is called to another s side to aid him; hence, a helper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It refers also to one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else; hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word carries the sense of consoling and consolation; hence, a consoler, a comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is used in the Gospel of John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7 for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, the One who takes care of our case or our affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is used in 1 John 2 in reference to the Lord Jesus as our Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we sin, He, based on the propitiation that He accomplished, takes care of our case by interceding Rom 8:34 and pleading for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we have seen, Advocate is a translation of the Greek word parakletos.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This word is formed of two words: the preposition para used here as a prefix and the word kletos.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Put together, these words denote someone called to our side.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word parakletos is used in the New Testament only by John.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In his Gospel John says, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that while the Lord was with the disciples, one parakletos, one Comforter, was there with them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this parakletos was about to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, there was the need for another parakletos, another Comforter, to come.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, the first parakletos and the other parakletos are one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The One who is called another Comforter is now in us as the life-giving Spirit, and the One who was the first Comforter, the Lord Jesus Christ, is now in the heavens at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the heavens we have the Lord Jesus Christ as our Comforter, and in our spirit we have the Spirit as another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, these two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, the Greek word parakletos is used for both the Comforter in the heavens and the Comforter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we put 1 John 2:1 together with John 14:16, we see that today the Lord Jesus is our Advocate at the right hand of God in the heavens; at the same time, He is also the Comforter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the heavens He is the Advocate with the Father; in our spirit He is the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why He is the ladder upon whom the angels of God are ascending and descending 1:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the ascended Lord, He is our Paraclete with the Father, taking care of our case in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the indwelling Spirit, He is the Paraclete with us 14:16-17 , the One alongside of us who is taking care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word parakletos is rendered Comforter in John 14:16 and Advocate in 1 John 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Also, in John 14:26 and 15:26 this Greek word is translated Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Comforter is an appropriate translation of parakletos in John 14:16, for in this verse there is a certain feeling that this Paraclete comes to comfort the disciples in their sorrow caused by the Lord s leaving them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord had told His disciples that He was leaving, and they were troubled by this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, in this chapter the Lord indicated to the disciples that they did not need to be sorrowful, for He would ask the Father to send them another Paraclete, another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because the troubled disciples were in need of comfort, it is correct to render parakletos in John 14:26 as Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This Greek word implies the thought of comfort and refers to one who helps us, serves us, stands by us, and goes along with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a one surely is a comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is also correct to translate parakletos in 1 John 2:1 as Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the usage in ancient times, this Greek word may refer to a person who functions as an attorney, a legal advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The situation in 1 John 2:1, in contrast to that in John 14:16, is a situation that requires an advocate or attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Advocate in 2:1 is actually a spiritual attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This parakletos stands beside us, like a nurse caring for us, and serves us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The parakletos is also a counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At school the students have a counselor to help them choose the right courses.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our parakletos also helps us in making choices.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In his translation of 1 John 2:1 J. N. Darby uses the word patron.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In his note he explains that the word patron is used in the sense of a Roman patron, who maintained the interests of his clients in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One function of a Roman patron was much like that of an attorney today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we are in a particular kind of situation, we may give the entire matter over into the hands of an attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The attorney then takes care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the function of our Advocate in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Parakletos is an all-inclusive word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It implies the thought of helping and nourishing, the thought of counseling, and also the thought of consoling.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It includes the concept of an advocate, an attorney, who takes care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ, an Advocate with the Father, takes our case as our attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Satan, the enemy of God and our subtle enemy, accuses us before our God day and night Rev 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps he tells God that although God is holy and righteous, His children whom He loves are unrighteous and filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Father then may tell him that His children have an excellent attorney, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our attorney, Christ, also may tell Satan to look upon His blood, which cleanses us from every sin, and to shut his accusing mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to Revelation 12:10 and 11, Satan accuses God s children day and night, but they can overcome him by the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once we realize that we are unclean, unholy, and unrighteous, we may feel defeated and be cut off from the Lord s dispensing of His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet we have not only the blood of Jesus but also Him as our Advocate, our Attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should tell Satan to shut his mouth and should praise the Lamb of God for His overcoming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then the divine life will be dispensed into us once again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ, our Advocate, takes care of our case so that life-dispensing can continue.</S>
