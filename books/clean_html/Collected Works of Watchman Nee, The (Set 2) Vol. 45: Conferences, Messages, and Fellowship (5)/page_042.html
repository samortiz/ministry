<h2 class="head2">In Money</h2><p>The first unrighteous thing we have to deal with is money. Money easily brings us into unrighteousness. We cannot take someone else's money as our own. Not a cent of others' money can be ours, and we cannot borrow (that is, personal borrowing, not borrowing in business). With some people, borrowing is a habit. It is like drugs to them; they are addicted to it. Time and again they borrow. If you want to be a brother to them, you should not lend anything to them. If you lend to them, you should be ready to sacrifice your relationship with them. Borrowing and lending is a great temptation; they lead to unrighteousness. When others transgress against us, we can be compensated by God. But if we transgress against others, we will not receive blessing from God. We cannot be careless in the matter of money.</p><p>There was a maid who stole over twenty dollars from her master before she was saved. After she was saved, she felt sorry and said to a sister, "I feel uneasy about keeping this money. I would like to offer it to God." When the sister heard this, she asked, "How do you know that God will take your booty?" She told the maid to return the money to her master. The maid agreed, and when she did this, she became peaceful. Another sister was asked by her sister in the flesh to let her use her admittance ticket to the park. She did not want to do it, but eventually she gave in. After she gave in, she lost her peace. A brother was taking a tram to Wen-teh Lane. The fare was seven cents, but he got off before he paid the fare. Later, he was condemned about this. It is not easy to be righteous. I told that brother that the next time he took the tram he should buy two tickets to make up for the previous trip.</p><p>If you have any unrighteous money remaining in your home, it will eat up the rest of your money and even eat up your spiritual life. It is all right to bargain when you shop, but do not try to cheat on the scale and do not hope that the arm on the scale will tip over more. Righteousness has nothing to do with whether or not others are willing to give us a bargain; it has to do with whether or not we are willing to accept a bargain. A missionary, Miss Liu, once took a summer vacation in the Lu Mountains. While she was there, someone tried to sell her bamboo baskets. She began to bargain with the man. At a certain point she could bargain no further, because she felt that it was no longer a matter of the man's willingness to sell, but a matter of the fairness of the price. Many people are only reluctantly willing; theirs is not a heartfelt willingness.</p><h2 class="head2">In Time</h2><p>We should not take advantage of others in time. We should render to others whatever time we owe them. It is unrighteous for us to steal others' time for our own use. Many people know that they should not steal money to offer to God, but they steal time to offer to God. This is also unrighteousness. We should deal with any unrighteousness in the use of our time.</p><h2 class="head2">In Responsibility</h2><p>We should also be righteous in bearing our responsibility. Some fathers are busy doing their own work. They have no time to be fathers. Their sons are deprived of the fatherly love they need. Likewise, many mothers have often been unrighteous in neglecting their responsibilities. Some mothers say that they want to be spiritual, and they do not need to care so much about their children. They say that they are committing everything to the Lord and leaving it up to the Lord to discipline the children. This is unrighteousness. A husband has his responsibility as a husband. If a husband does not take up the financial responsibility of the family, he is being unrighteous. A wife has to bear the responsibility of the housework or else she is unrighteous. Every person has his or her area of responsibility. You have your sphere; I cannot decide what it is. But you know when you infringe on others' sphere or when you become unfaithful in your own. We have to learn to be a righteous person in our responsibilities.</p><h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING A HABIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>We should render to others whatever is due to them. If we do not render it to them, we are being unrighteous. We should discover new items of unrighteousness every day in our daily life and deal with them accordingly. We may commit some accidental unrighteous acts, but we have to learn to discover them and deal with them also. For example, we know that we should not trespass on lawns. But many people trespass inadvertently. We have to deal with such unrighteousness. Righteousness is a habit which we have to cultivate; it is a way that we have to take. We have to learn to deny all looseness and unrighteousnesses. If we do this we will spontaneously live out righteousness.</p><p>We should learn to be a righteous person, but we should not try to intentionally act this out. Sometimes others can be turned off by our righteousness. Tonight we have to settle our account before the Lord. We have to discover all of our unrighteousnesses and learn to deal with them one by one. We should receive God's shining and refuse Satan's condemnation. Sometimes unrighteous things flash before our eyes from all angles. Some are real and some are counterfeits. Satan tries to show us these things in an instant to crush us. This is his snare; it is not God's work, and we have to reject it. God's work is gradual; it works step by step. God enlightens us gradually; He guides us to deal with things one by one with the goal of developing a habit of righteousness, of learning to take the way of righteousness according to the holy life, and of serving Him in holiness and righteousness.</p>
