   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Before chapter thirty-two, there is no record that Jacob prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 32:3-4 Jacob sent messengers to Esau, commanding them to address Esau as his lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him" 32:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Jacob heard this news, he was afraid and prayed about it to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Fearing that Esau was planning to kill him and his family, Jacob was forced to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the record of Genesis, this is the first instance of Jacob's praying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before this, Jacob did not pray because he had always had his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When it came to fleeing from Laban, he used his skillful way, talking to his wives in a very convincing tone and persuading them to stand with him against their father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unlike Esau, Jacob was not a good fighter, but he certainly was a good speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The record in Genesis 31 exposes our own situation, giving us an accurate picture of what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This surely is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the word life is not mentioned in this chapter, the very life in the Gospel of John, the Gospel of life, is found here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 10:10 the Lord Jesus said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The way to have life abundantly is in Genesis 31, not in John 10.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis 31 is a revelation of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout all my years in the ministry, I have seen many cases concerning the relationship between husband and wife, and often I have been asked to mediate between a husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every sister who has asked me to mediate between her and her husband has expected that after I prayed for them, her husband would be changed into an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of us still cling to this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some sisters may say to themselves, "My husband is so pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Surely if the elders and the leading sisters pray for him, the Lord will change him into an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If my husband cannot be an elder in the church, he can at least be a deacon."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the Lord will certainly answer this prayer, He will not answer it according to our way, but according to His way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's way is not magical.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not expect that in one day your husband will be changed into an angel and that you will be able to testify about it in the next church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many of you have been in the church life for several years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps you have been praying for yourself, asking the Lord to transform you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have you been transformed?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must admit that you are still somewhat natural.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the meetings, we all appear to be transformed, but how do you appear at the dining table with your wife?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of us must admit that we are exactly the same as the Jacob in Genesis 31.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I praise the Lord that there has been a significant change in many of the saints throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But where are you today in Genesis 48 or in Genesis 31?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must admit that, at best, you are in chapter thirty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot have the maturity of life, the transformation of life, overnight, or even in a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a life-long matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not grow like a mushroom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you study the biography of Jacob, you will see that even when he was in his mother's womb God began to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The natural life of Jacob realized that two were in the womb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although he tried his best to be born first, God allowed his brother to come out first.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since that time, in chapter after chapter, we see the striving of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But at the end of the book of Genesis, Jacob's striving is over.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As Jacob worshipped God, the supplanting hands now leaned upon the top of his staff, the sign of his pilgrim life on earth Heb 11:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the end of Genesis, Jacob was thoroughly transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only at the end of his lifetime was his transformation complete.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Transformation requires our whole lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not expect it to be accomplished in a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe that every day and even every hour something is working for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, this takes a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of the fifty chapters in this book, the record relating to Jacob occupies more than half of them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the long record of a transformed life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus can save us instantaneously, we can consecrate ourselves quickly, and we may even come into the church life in a very fast way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But it takes a long time to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to have a great many ups and downs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes within one day we may have three ups and three downs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is our natural being, our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the matters of God's selection and transformation, Jacob is the prototype in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 9 tells us this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But throughout the generations not many Christians have seen this, thinking that the chapters dealing with Jacob's history are merely interesting stories.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Few Christians view these chapters as the record of the model of a transformed life.</S>
