   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prayer: May the Lord cause us to speak the things that we ought to speak, and may You cause the listeners to hear what they ought to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We confess that we are not godly enough and do not have the adequate knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need You to open up our eyes within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every time we come together, we need Your precious blood to cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE BASIC PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may be a proper Christian, and we may manage a church well, but this is not enough to meet the need of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to understand our basic problem before we can consider the question of methodology.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What God wants to do is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no problem with God in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But with man there is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we want to put water into a bottle, we can do it any time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not have to preach to the bottle or have the bottle's consent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But man is not so simple; he is living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not know how many people there are who are willing to be filled with God as a result of these few evenings' meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The man whom God wants to gain is a person fully endowed with a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's mind is higher than man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But man's mind is nevertheless very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition, he is full of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, if man wants to be filled, his will must first be put under subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is hard to chop a piece of wood with uneven grain because it is too complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only wood with even grain is good for chopping.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God picked up us, the complicated pieces of wood, for the purpose of manifesting His power.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is able to clear up and to subdue our will and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although God has redeemed us, has given us eternal life and the forgiveness of sins, and has lived inside of us, His ultimate purpose is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's ultimate work is to have the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Jerusalem is made of gold, precious stones, and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In it are the throne of God, His light, and the river of water of life with the tree of life, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Gold signifies the divine nature, and pearl signifies the result of the transformation of God's life within man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The precious stones speak of the glory as a result of the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The tree of life, the water of life, and the fruit of life all refer to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's masterpiece is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The New Jerusalem is God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything else will pass away, and the heavens and the earth will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything apart from God cannot be joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only that which comes out of God can be joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our eyes need to be opened, and we need a deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once we see this matter, we will no longer do what we did before.</S>
