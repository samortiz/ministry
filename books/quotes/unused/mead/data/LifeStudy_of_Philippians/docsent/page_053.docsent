   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DERIVED FROM THE EXCELLENCY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE PERSON OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Jews consider the law of God given through Moses the most excellent thing in history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, they are zealous for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul participated in that zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when Christ was revealed to him by God Gal 1:15-16 , he saw that the excellency, the super-eminence, the supreme preciousness, the surpassing worth, of Christ far exceeded the excellency of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His knowledge of Christ issued in the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On account of this, not only did he count the law and the religion founded on the law to be loss, but he counted all things loss.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here Paul speaks not directly of the excellency of Christ, but of the excellency of knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The knowledge in 3:8 is not the knowledge that belongs to Christ, the knowledge that Christ Himself has; it is our subjective knowing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To you, which is more excellent the Person of Christ or your knowing Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to doctrine or opinion, you may say that the Person of Christ is more excellent than the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, Paul, speaking from his experience, could say that it is the knowledge of Christ which is more excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have pointed out that the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There can be no doubt that in Himself Christ is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if we do not have the knowledge of Christ, how shall we know His excellency?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we lack the knowledge of Christ s excellency, His excellency will not mean anything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before Paul s experience on the road to Damascus, he did not have any knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He treasured the law and regarded it as most excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul s zeal for the law was a sign of his appreciation of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His zeal came out of his appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul certainly was proud of his excellent knowledge of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though Christ is infinitely more excellent than the law, Paul did not have the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But at the time of his conversion, this excellent One was revealed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With this revelation of Christ, Paul began to have the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After he began to acquire the knowledge of Christ, Paul came to realize that the knowledge of the law received through Gamaliel was far inferior to the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Conscious of this comparison as he was writing 3:5-8, Paul could speak of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and of suffering the loss of all things for the excellency of this knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be sure, the excellency is in the very Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But for our experience, our realization of this excellency depends on our knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we lack knowledge, there is simply no way for us to realize that this Person is so excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only when we come to know His excellency do we have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How precious is this excellency of the knowledge of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVENESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the four books that make up the heart of the divine revelation Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians Paul opens the veil to show us who Christ is and what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is all-inclusive and all-extensive, the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the reality of God, man, eternity, light, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We simply do not have adequate words to declare who and what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What was the extent of your knowledge of Christ before the books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians were opened to you in the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps you knew only that Christ is the Son of God sent by the Father in His mercy to die on the cross for the salvation of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You knew that He was born of a virgin, that He died on the cross, that He was raised from among the dead, and that He was exalted to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You believed in Him as your dear Redeemer and precious Savior, and in this way you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you realized that you need Him to help you live in such a way as to glorify the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is good to know Christ in this way, but this knowledge of Him is far too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Forty-eight years ago, I also had such a limited knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But beginning in 1932 the Lord through the recovery has gradually been opening the veil that I may have a fuller knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Little by little, the veil has been taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I believe that many saints in the Lord s recovery can give the same testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only recently have I been impressed with the extensiveness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One day as I was speaking on the Christ revealed in Colossians, I spontaneously used the term extensive and pointed out that the revelation in Colossians concerning Christ is extensive, even all-extensive, for Christ is more extensive than the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is immeasurable, limitless.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, He is not only all-inclusive, but also all-extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the Bible, Christ truly is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1932 I first began to see the all-inclusiveness of Christ and to minister along this line.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although Christ s all-inclusiveness is clearly revealed in the Bible, many believers are greatly surprised when they hear us speak of it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Colossians 2:16 and 17 say, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These verses indicate that Christ is our eating, drinking, feast, new moon, and Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is the body, the reality, the substance, of all the positive things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the reality of the air we breathe, of the food we eat, and of the sunshine we enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, He is the reality of both the Triune God and of man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we teach that Christ is all-inclusive, the reality of all positive things in the universe, some go so far as to accuse us of teaching pantheism.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They accuse us of identifying God with the material creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We utterly repudiate pantheism and declare that it is a devilish teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not preach pantheism in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, according to the Bible, we do teach that Christ is God, man, and the reality of all positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But this does not mean that the material things in the universe are God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are not God and we never shall become God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Nevertheless, Christ is in us and, in a very real sense, He is even becoming us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Colossians 3:10 and 11 say, And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created Him; where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These verses also point to the all-inclusiveness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the new man, the Body, the church, there cannot be Greek and Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Likewise, there cannot be Chinese and American, German and French.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is all the members and in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This means that in the new man Christ is you and Christ is me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He truly is all-inclusive and all-extensive.</S>
