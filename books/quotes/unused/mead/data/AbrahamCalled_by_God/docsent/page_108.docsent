   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ABSOLUTE Rebekah was absolute vv.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>57-58, 61 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Rebekah had never seen Isaac, she was willing to go to him without hesitation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She did not say to her mother, "Mother, I have never seen Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps I should correspond with him first and afterward have him pay us a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then I could decide whether or not to marry him."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rebekah did not talk in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although her brother and mother were hesitating, wanting her to stay for at least ten days, she said, "I will go."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She was absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the past forty years, I have seen a number of young sisters who developed mental problems as a result of considering marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some spent days, weeks, months, and even years considering whether a particular brother was the one whom God had prepared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When such sisters came to me, I said, with a rebuking tone, "If you feel he is the brother, marry him blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if he is not the one, forget about him and don't talk about it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more you consider, the more you bother God, yourself, and me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can I tell you yes or no?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I say yes, you will say that I do not know him well.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I say no, you will feel unhappy because you have already fallen in love with him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Don't think about it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Either marry him or forget about him."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was serious in telling them this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Young sisters, if you want to be married, you must learn to be kind, diligent, and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>SUBMISSIVE Rebekah was also submissive vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>64-65 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When she saw Isaac and realized who he was, "she took a veil, and covered herself."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sisters, do not put a piece of cloth on your head as a decoration or ornament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It must be a sign of your submission.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once you are married, you are no longer your own head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your husband is your head, and your head must be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the true meaning of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>LABAN AND BETHUEL</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Laban and Bethuel were in the fear of the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were also very hospitable vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hospitality often brings in the greatest blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel and the sister of Laban, to become Isaac's wife was a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That blessing was secured by their being hospitable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they had not been hospitable but rather had rejected Abraham's servant, that wonderful marriage would never have taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, they accepted the Lord's sovereignty, saying, "The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>50-51, 55-60 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Laban and Bethuel recognized that this was the Lord's doing and that they had no right to say anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here we see the atmosphere of their life, a life in oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>ISAAC</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Isaac was not a man of activity, for he did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He simply dwelt by a well, by a place of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 63 says, "Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Translators of the Bible are bothered about the rendering of the Hebrew in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some versions interpret it as meaning that Isaac went to the field to pray, and others say that he went to the field to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It might have been that Isaac was meditating in the presence of the Lord, possibly considering his marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He had lost his mother, did not have a wife, and the most trustworthy servant had gone on a journey.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Isaac did not know if the servant would ever come back.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The family had no safety or security, and he was in a desperate situation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, he went out to the field to seek the Lord and meditate before God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While he was meditating, Rebekah came.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After the servant had told Isaac all that had happened, Isaac took what his father had done for him and married Rebekah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>66-67 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His marriage was an inheritance, not a strife.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did not strive for a wife; he inherited what his father had done for him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He did not do a thing to get a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He only took what the father had secured for him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Acting in this way, he was one with the Lord that the purpose of God might be fulfilled in him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He had a real and solid marriage without a wedding ceremony.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>FULFILLING THE PURPOSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Isaac's marriage eventually fulfilled the purpose of God 21:12b; 22:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The life of those in this chapter was not merely for their own human living; it was a life that issued in the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, a life which brought forth Christ and produced the kingdom of God for God's economy.</S>
