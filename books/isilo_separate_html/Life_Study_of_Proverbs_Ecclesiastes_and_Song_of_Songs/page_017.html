Almsgiving versus Stinginess</H2><P>There is one who scatters and increases yet more, and there is one who withholds what is appropriate but ends up only in want. The blessing soul will prosper, and he who waters will also be watered himself. As for him who withholds grain, the people will curse him; but blessing will be upon the head of him who sells it (vv. 24-26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Love for Correction versus Hatred for Reproof</H2><P>Whoever loves correction loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid (12:1). Poverty and shame will come to him who refuses correction, but he who regards reproof will be honored (13:18). A fool despises his father's correction, but he who regards reproof gets prudence. The ear that listens to the reproof of life will lodge among the wise. He who ignores instruction despises his own soul, but he who listens to reproof acquires understanding (15:5, 31-32).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Practicalness versus Vainness</H2><P>He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, but he who pursues worthless things lacks sense (12:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. Listening to Counsel versus Being Self-righteous</H2><P>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to counsel (v. 15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>15. Holding Back Anger versus Being Prone to Anger</H2><P>A fool's anger is known at once, but a prudent man conceals shame (v. 16). He who is slow to anger is of great understanding, but he who has a hasty spirit exalts folly (14:29). A wrathful man stirs up contention, but he who is slow to anger quietens strife (15:18). He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he who rules his spirit, than he who captures a city (16:32). He who is cool in spirit is a man of understanding (17:27b). The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook a transgression. A man of great wrath will bear the penalty; for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again (19:11, 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>16. Truthfulness (or Faithfulness) versus Falsehood</H2><P>The lip of truth shall be established forever, but a lying tongue is only for a moment. Lying lips are an abomination to Jehovah, but those who deal faithfully are His delight (12:19, 22). A faithful witness will not lie, but a false witness utters lies (14:5).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
