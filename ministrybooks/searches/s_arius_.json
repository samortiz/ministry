Although He is the true [18] image of the Father, He is merely the image. He can forgive sins not because He has a sinless nature but because He was able to withstand the temptation of the devil. The Holy Spirit was the first item created by the Son. The bishop of Alexandria called a council and removed Arius from office. However, many people still followed Arius. Arius maintained his teaching, wrote hymns, and preached in many places. Many followed his teaching, and the controversy became intense. In view of this, Constantine called for the first council in Nicaea of Asia Minor (A.D. 325). Based upon strong arguments from Athanasius, a deacon graduated from Alexandria only a year prior to that, the council exiled Arius. The compromising group attempted to interpret a word in the Nicene Creed that speaks of \u201cthe same essence\u201d to \u201csimilar essence.\u201d Neither the Arians nor the compromising ones believed that the Father and the Son are of the same essence. In A.D. 381 the Roman emperor gathered the bishops of the eastern church and called for a second council. In that council both Arianism and the compromisers were condemned. Some in the compromising group said that the Holy Spirit was also created and acted as the messenger of the Father and the Son, similar to the archangel. Based on the Scriptures, the second council confirmed that the Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son, and like the Son, was sent by the Father. "

Athanasius refuted this teaching, based on Origen\u2019s teaching that Christ must have a human spirit because this is a necessary link between the Word and the Lord\u2019s body of flesh. The council of Alexandria in A.D. 362 confirmed that the humanity of Christ is perfect. Apollinarius, the bishop of Laodicea, denied such a teaching and made a new assertion, saying that Christ has a human soul but not a human spirit. Instead, He has the divine Spirit in place of the human spirit. The second council condemned this teaching as unscriptural. However, it did not explain the relationship between Christ\u2019s two complete natures of divinity and humanity. "

The Nestorians asserted that the two natures of Christ, divinity and humanity, are distinct and are not mingled. The theology of Antioch believed the same all the more. The theology of [19] Alexandria, on the other hand, emphasized the divinity of Christ and even called Mary the Mother of God. Both were too extreme. Nestorius, a patriarch of Constantinople, was originally from the school in Antioch. When some presbyters under this school asserted that Mary was the mother not of Christ\u2019s divinity but only of His humanity, he strongly supported them. Nestorius overemphasized the distinctiveness of Christ\u2019s divinity and humanity; he even claimed that in the body of Jesus were two persons, God and man. This is the source of the error of Nestorianism. Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria, opposed this doctrine. The emperor of both the East and the West convened the third council in Ephesus in A.D. 431. The council rejected the Nestorian doctrine, considering it a heresy, but it did not explain the relationship between the two natures of Christ. Moreover, it stressed divinity over humanity. Later, Eutychius, an archimandrite of a monastery at Constantinople, asserted the merging of Christ\u2019s two natures, with humanity being merged into divinity, making Him an extraordinary person. The archbishop Flavian of Constantinople renounced the claim. Eutychius did not listen and was thus removed from his office. However, Dioscorus of Alexandria appealed on behalf of Eutychius. The bishops still maintained that the doctrine was in disagreement with the Scriptures, and they called for a council to renounce the teaching as heresy. However, the emperor was displeased and later convoked another council in Ephesus in A.D. 449. The bishop of Alexandria led soldiers and presbyters to attend, exiled the bishops of Constantinople and Antioch, and even attacked and caused chaos at the council. Flavian died from major injuries. This council was known as the Robbers\u2019 Council and is not listed as one of the ecumenical councils. Later, the fourth council was assembled in Constantinople (Chalcedon) in A.D. 451. At this time the Monophysites slightly changed their teaching, saying that although the humanity of Jesus was inferior, through its merging with divinity it had become a new nature that was different from either one. Based on a letter of Leo, the bishop of Rome, to Flavian, the council declared that Christ is one person with two natures, and the two natures are unconfused, unchangeable, indivisible, and inseparable. He is the complete God and the perfect man. Later, the Monophysites still contested with the orthodox school, and a fifth council was convened in Constantinople in A.D. 553. In spite of this, the dispute continued. [20] "

Therefore, Arius taught that since Christ is a creature, He cannot be equal with the Father.

The tritheists, who [419] believe that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not only distinct but also separate, went to the extreme of emphasizing the threeness of the Trinity to the extent of neglecting Their oneness.

In a message in which Brother Nee says clearly that Christ is the first among God\u2019s creatures so that He may have the preeminence, the first place, in God\u2019s creation, the brother\u2019s translation changed the meaning of Brother Nee\u2019s speaking. The theological background to his kind of reasoning is that during the fourth century a theologian named Arius produced a great heresy indicating that Christ is not God but an excellent man, a creature, created before the foundation of the world. He taught this heresy based on Colossians 1:15, which says that Christ is \u201cthe Firstborn of all creation.\u201d "

Actually, they dared not speak concerning this matter, since it became associated with heresy. Thus, from that time no one spoke much concerning that point until Brother Nee was faithful to present to us the truths in Colossians 1. Brother Nee explained that Christ is not only the Creator but also part of the creation because He became a man. He pointed out that man is a creature and that according to Hebrews 2:14, Christ became a man by partaking of flesh and blood (cf. John 1:14). Moreover, to deny that Christ is one of the creatures equals not confessing that Christ came in the flesh, that is, not confessing that He is both God and man. This is a great heresy (1 John 4:2-3). As God, Christ is the Creator, and as man, He is a creature. "

[12] He pointed out that for the same reason, Revelation 13 speaks concerning Christ being crucified from the foundation of the world, even though the crucifixion took place only two thousand years ago (v. 8). Therefore, Christ is the first among the creatures because in God\u2019s eternal view He became a creature even before His incarnation in time. That was Brother Nee\u2019s teaching. In a translation of one of Brother Nee\u2019s statements related to this matter, the brother made a subtle change to what Brother Nee said so that it meant that Christ came from the place of the Creator to the place of the creature, indicating a change only in location rather than a change in status and position. Because of the condemnation on Arius, this brother dared not present the truth that Christ as the Creator became a creature. "

However, very few dare to say this, because it is condemned as a heresy. All the ancient Bible teachers tried to reconcile the aspect of three with the aspect of one related to the Godhead. From the second and third centuries onward, many debates took place concerning the Triune God and the person of Christ. Some of these debates involved heretics such as Sabellius and Arius. Arius taught that Christ was a creature without deity prior to His resurrection but that through His resurrection He was promoted to become God. At the time when Constantine the Great came into power, Christianity was prevailing around the Mediterranean, and the contentions among Christians became a problem. As a result of Constantine\u2019s desire to unify the Roman Empire, he called a conference at Nicaea in A.D. 325. At that council, the Council of Nicaea, Arius and his heresy were condemned. The result of that council brought about only a temporary situation of peace, for problem after problem occurred from that [322] time onward. Sometime later, the papal system was established, resulting in a situation of darkness until the time of the Reformation. Before the Reformation, laymen were not allowed to interpret the Bible, but with the Reformation came the open Bible. When the Bible became open, the arguments began a second time. "

To be created or born implies that the created or born one previously did not exist. Although Christ is the ever-existing God, the Bible also teaches that He was born as a man, thus becoming a creature. The Bible and God are not limited by our narrow notion of time. For example, Revelation 13:8 says that Christ the Lamb \u201cwas slain from the foundation of the world.\u201d We need to put aside our religious concepts, which are based on traditional teachings, and receive the pure revelation of the Bible.
