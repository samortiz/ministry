Immediately after the prayer, I knew whether or not the person was going to be healed. After entering the room I would anoint him, depending upon the situation, and after my prayer I would ask, "Well, how is your sickness?" The answer would show at once whether or not the person had faith. If he said, "Praise the Lord, it is all settled," he might still feel very weak and have a high fever, but he could praise the Lord. I would then ask, "Do I need to come back and pray again?" If he said that there is no need because it was all done, I could leave in confidence, no matter how serious his condition seemed to be, because he did not believe that God would heal him, but that He had already healed him. Sometimes when I asked a person about his sickness, the answer was different: "I believe that the Lord is going to heal me. I am as certain as anything that God is going to heal me. I believe with all my heart that I am going to be healed." He may seem to have all the faith in the world that he is going to be healed, but I go home disappointed. I know that he is not going to be healed. There was no divine touch, no faith. The man said that he believed, but he did not believe at all, he only hoped.</p><p>Do we see the importance of Mark 11:24? God says we must believe that we have received. Once the Lord granted me a wonderful healing, and I testified to a few of the believers. Among them was a sister who had very serious eye trouble. Every week she had to travel a considerable distance by steamboat to be treated by a doctor, under whose care she had gradually improved. She heard my testimony and thought, "Though the doctor said I would be better, he said I never could be normal again." So she prayed and believed that the Lord would heal. But she had an appointment with the doctor and so she went to see him. He gave her some glasses and a jar of ointment. After she got on the steamboat, she prayed again and said, "Lord, are You really going to heal me?" She believed that the Lord had already heard her prayers and that the thing was done. So she said, "Lord, what do I need these glasses and ointment for?" However, Satan said, "Do not be so quick; do not be excessive; do not be fanatical. Wait and see if it works. If it does not work, you will still have your glasses and ointment to fall back on. In this way, you will be protected on both sides." But she said, "My prayer has been heard; it is already done; I am healed. There is no need for glasses or ointment." Then Satan said, "The glasses cost thirty dollars. If you throw them away, you will be wasting thirty dollars. If your prayers and faith do not work, you will have to spend another thirty dollars to replace them." But she said, "I am already healed. What do I need ointment and glasses for?" So she threw them overboard. (I am not suggesting that you throw your glasses away, and that we do not need the help of doctors. But if we have faith, we can do anything.) She went back and her eyes were really healed. Remember the Lord's word, "Believe that you have received them, and you will have them." Faith is always in the past tense, though experience may be in the future. If we make faith a matter of the future, because experience is still in the future, our faith is hope. After the sister returned, she testified of what the Lord had done, and a brother who was in exactly the same circumstances heard her testimony. (He was also present when I spoke of what the Lord had done for me.) This brother had exactly the same disease and went to the same doctor, who prescribed exactly the same treatment for him. He said to himself, "If God is able to heal her eyes, is He not able to heal my eyes?" So he prayed. Then one of my co-workers came to me and said, "Do you know that Brother So-and-so is trusting the Lord to heal his eyes? Is this not grand?" "No," I said, "We should wait to see whether it is hope or faith." He also had an appointment with the doctor, and he too went to get glasses and ointment. After he got them, he boarded the same boat and argued, "If I am healed, should I not throw away my glasses and ointment?" He remembered that the sister had thrown her glasses and ointment into the river, and so he did the same thing. He said, "I will trust the Lord and the Lord alone; I will not trust the doctor or medicine." On his return he came to see me. I asked him, "Why did you throw your glasses and ointment away?" "Oh, I trust God. From today I will not trust man but God alone," he replied. "What about your eyes?" I asked. "I can trust God," he said. Then I said, "But you have only those two eyes; they are very precious. If anything happens to them, you can never replace them." He said, "I believe God is going to heal my eyes." "Do you really believe that God is going to heal your eyes?" I asked. He said, "Yes, if I did not believe that God was going to heal my eyes, do you think that I would have been so foolish as to throw away my glasses and ointment?" I said to him, "I am sorry to say this, but your faith is too big for God to do anything. I am afraid that one day you will have to go back to that doctor and buy another pair of glasses." "What do you mean?" he asked. I replied, "You have hope in God but no faith." He was rather irritated, and he went out and said to another brother, "One day Brother Nee will see that he is wrong. I will prove to him that I have faith. I know God is going to heal me." My co-worker came in and asked, "Why did you say that he has no faith? Why do you believe that God is not going to heal him?" I replied, "Because he has no faith at all; he has only hope." "What do you mean?" he asked. "Do you not remember that Mark 11:24 explains the nature of real faith?" I said. He responded, "Do you mean to say that a person who risks blindness does not have real faith? If this is not faith, what is? Do you mean to say that a person who throws away thirty dollars for his faith and throws away fees amounting to a hundred dollars does not have real faith? If that is not faith, what is?" I said, "These are all works, not faith. It is all something that he has done; it is not believing in what God has done." Of course, I was more than willing for him to be healed. I did not want him to not be healed so that I would be proven right! A month passed, and nothing happened. Two months passed, and I saw him again. His eyes were redder and the discharge worse. One day he came to me and said, "Do you still believe that I do not have faith?" I said, "I fear that this is the case." He replied, "I believe that God is going to heal me. One thing I know: God has shown me that I must go up the river to preach. I will stay for two months, and when I come back, I will be healed." I said, "Try your best to believe that you will be healed." I said nothing to discourage him, but I said to my co-worker, "He believes that if he does something for God, God will do something for him. His belief is related to the future, not the past." He came back unhealed, and he had to resort to glasses. Today he still wears them.</p><p>These two cases were exactly parallel. One was healed and one was not healed because one had faith and the other had none. One believed and the other only hoped. We think that if people risk something, they have faith; however, these are the works of men, not the faith of men. If we believe, we should say, "Praise the Lord, it is done."</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 46: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (6) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
