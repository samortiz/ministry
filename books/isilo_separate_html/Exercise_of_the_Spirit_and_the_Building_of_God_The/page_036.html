<p>The Bible is not merely a book of teachings. It is more than a book of teachings. The Bible is a book of supply. There are at least two verses that confirm this. One verse is Matthew 4:4, which says, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; The emphasis in this verse is &ldquo;every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; That which comes out of the mouth of God is what He is filled with, just as a person&rsquo;s words are the expression of what he is filled with. The words that come out of the mouth of God are His riches and His element. Hence, these words are our supply; they enable us to live in His presence. The second verse is Jeremiah 15:16, which says, &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them.&rdquo; The Word of God is edible; hence, it is full of supply.</p>
<p>There are other portions in the Bible that speak of the Word of God as our nourishment. For example, Paul said that in his ministry he supplied the believers either with milk or with solid food (1 Cor. 3:2). Some portions are simpler and are easier to digest and therefore are likened to milk. Other portions of the Bible are more difficult and are harder to digest and therefore are likened to solid food. However, both milk and solid food supply nourishment. This shows that the Bible is not merely a book of teachings but rather a book of supply. It is food for us to eat. We need to esteem the Bible highly because it is God&rsquo;s great gift to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God has given us another great gift&mdash;the Holy Spirit. This giving is referred to many times in the Bible. For example, in Matthew 7:11 the Lord Jesus said that our Father in the heavens will give good things to those who ask of Him. According to Luke 11:13, <em>good things</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. In God&rsquo;s eyes, the &ldquo;good things&rdquo; in the universe is the Holy Spirit. God gives good things&mdash;the Holy Spirit&mdash;as a great gift to those who ask of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Center of God&rsquo;s Promises</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God promised to give His gift to man (Ezek. 36:26-27; Joel 2:28-29). In the New Testament the Lord said that He would pour out the Holy Spirit upon His believers (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-5, 8). Therefore, the Holy Spirit is the center of God&rsquo;s promises to His people both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament (Gal. 3:14). On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out (Acts 2:1-4), thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s sweet promise. From that time onward, all the riches of God were available to man through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It is correct to say that the entire Bible is concerning Christ. But it is also correct to say that the entire Bible is concerning the Holy Spirit, because starting in the Old Testament God repeatedly promised that the Holy Spirit would come. Hence, the Old Testament is the promise of the Holy Spirit. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus repeatedly said that He would give us the Holy Spirit. In John 14 and 16, before the Lord&rsquo;s death, He spoke extensively regarding the coming of the Holy Spirit. After the Lord resurrected, He breathed the Holy Spirit into His disciples, and He commanded them to wait in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit, the promise of the Father, would come upon them (20:22; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-5, 8). After receiving the Holy Spirit, they became a group of people who lived in the Holy Spirit. From Acts to the end of Revelation the focus of the divine revelation is on the living of the believers in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Realization of Christ</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit causes everything of Christ to be realized in men, just as Christ caused all that the Father is to be manifested among men. Just as Christ was God manifested among men, so the Spirit is Christ realized in men. One is a matter of manifestation; the other is a matter of realization. God in Christ can be experienced and enjoyed by us in a real and practical way because the Spirit is the realization of Christ. Our experiencing and enjoying God is altogether a matter in the Holy Spirit. The work of the Holy Spirit includes revealing and explaining Christ to us so that He can become our reality. For this reason, the Holy Spirit is called &ldquo;the Spirit of realty&rdquo; (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Realized according to the Bible</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit enters into us in order for Christ to be realized in us according to the revelation of the Holy Scriptures. The Bible explains and reveals Christ, and the Spirit causes all that has been explained and revealed in the Bible concerning Christ to be realized in us and become our reality. The Spirit and the Word are one.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the Word realized in us, and the Word expresses the Spirit. Every aspect of God&rsquo;s relationship with man is a matter of the Word and the Spirit. That which God speaks is the Word, and that which enters into man is the Spirit. The Word is in our hand, and the Spirit is in us. It is hard to distinguish between the two. The riches of God are revealed in the Word, and the Word that enters into us becomes spirit and life. Not only so, when we express the indwelling Spirit through our speaking, He becomes the word of God to those who hear, and what they receive becomes spirit and life in them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
