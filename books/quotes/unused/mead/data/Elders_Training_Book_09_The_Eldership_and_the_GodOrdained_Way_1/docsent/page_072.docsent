   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO OUR SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN A GRADUAL AND POSITIVE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You also must take good care of the present situation you are in. You may be in a local church that is not so high, so living, or so encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hardly anyone may like to visit people by knocking on their doors, and some may even oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What should you do in such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may have been sick with the same disease, so you should be able to sympathize with all the sick ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should be patient with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You need to visit these dear ones to pray with them, to have fellowship with them, to warm up their cold heart, and to stir up their down spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may have to do this for an entire year to get a few to rise up to realize the burden you are bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe the proverb that says: "Where there is a will, there is a way."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to practice the Lord's present recovery, His new way, but we should not be too hasty or rough.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be patient with the saints and we should not categorize them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should love everyone with the same love and avoid creating any kind of division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to be with the saints the way Paul was in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He told the brothers there, "You yourselves know..how I was with you all the time" Acts 20:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was with the saints day by day for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of us may have to work for a living, but we still should have the evenings and weekends to give to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can use our leisure time for the Lord's interests.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The unbelievers spend much time for their pleasure, amusement, and recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, the best amusement is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A brother among us told the story of his grandfather who was a baker.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He worked in a bakery from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m., but nearly every day the first thing he did when he came home from work was to go and visit people for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter how we labor, it is much better than being idle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How wonderful it is to be in the Lord's recovery, and now by His mercy we have a way to practice the church life by the preaching of the gospel, home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This way is full of labor but also full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we take this way, we will enjoy the Lord's presence, and we, our family, and our church will be greatly blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to our present situation, I feel that the wisest thing is for us to go on in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must bring the saints into the full realization of the new way gradually by the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not lead the church into this in a hasty way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I want to point out again that the new way is composed of the following steps: 1 preaching the gospel for begetting; 2 having home meetings for nourishing; 3 having group meetings for teaching; and 4 having church meetings for building.</S>
