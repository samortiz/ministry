   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 15 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 20:1-2, 8-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>8 And when evening fell, the master of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the last ones to the first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>9 And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>10 And when the first ones came, they supposed that they would receive more.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And they themselves also received each a denarius.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>11 And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>12 Saying, These last ones worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>13 But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I am doing nothing unrighteous to you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>14 Take what is yours and go.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I want to give to this last one even as I have given to you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Or is your eye evil because I am good?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>16 Thus shall the 1 last be first and the first last.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The householder in verse 1 is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Morning here is 6:00 a.m., denoting the earliest part of the church age, when Christ came to call His disciples into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The workmen denote the disciples, and the vineyard denotes the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The agreement referred to in verse 2 denotes the agreement He made in 19:27-29.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The denarius is the reward the Lord offered Peter in His agreement with him in 19:27-29.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to verse 8, the householder rewarded the workmen at evening, that is, at 6:00 p.m., denoting the end of the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 8 says, "And when evening fell, the master of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the last ones to the first."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is against the natural and commercial concept.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It indicates that the wages paid to the last workmen are not according to their work but according to the gracious wish of the Lord of the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Much to the surprise of those hired first, the last were the first to receive the reward, although they worked just one hour, not during the heat of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those hired first should remember Romans 9:14-15 and 20.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no unrighteousness with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who were they to reply against the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Matt 20:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Peter's natural concept, representing that of all believers, was commercial; he did not know the Lord's gracious wish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, he murmured against the Lord according to legality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be saved is to receive grace, and to gain the reward is to enjoy the grace we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After receiving grace we must learn to enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To leave all things behind and follow the Lord is not to pay a price; it is to enjoy the grace we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not think that you have sacrificed anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What you sacrifice is just dung; it is vanity of vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything under the sun is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your education, position, and future are all vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To leave all things behind is to be unloaded and released.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have given up all things for the Lord in a proper spirit, we would say, "O Lord, I am not paying a price I am daily enjoying grace."</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>16 1 The last are the latest workmen, and the first are the earliest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In working, the earliest come first, but in receiving the reward, the last become the first.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is in this way that the Lord makes the last first and the first last.</S>
