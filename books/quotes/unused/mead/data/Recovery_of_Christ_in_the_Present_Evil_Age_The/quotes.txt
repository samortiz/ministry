[1]  The Recovery of Christ in the Present Evil Age CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE PRESENT EVIL AGE 1 THE SECULAR WORLD AND THE RELIGIOUS WORLD
[3]  The Bible shows us that there are two different kinds of worlds.
[4]  The term the world usually refers to the universe composed of the heavens and earth created by God for His purpose and corrupted by Satan to oppose God.
[5]  CHRIST MINISTERING OUTSIDE OF RELIGION AND BEING OPPOSED BY RELIGION
[6]  When the Lord Jesus was thirty years of age, He came out to minister.
[7]  One day He went to a little house in Bethany, where He had intimate fellowship with His disciples Matt 26:6-13 .
[8]  After the Lord had been ministering for some time, He took His disciples far from the holy temple and the holy city, close to the border of the Holy Land, to a place called Caesarea Philippi, to give them a revelation of Christ and the church 16:13-18 .
[9]  Nevertheless, after the Lord revealed that He was the bread of life to be eaten by His believers, the disciples said, This word is hard; who can hear it? v. 60 . In John 7, as the Lord was teaching in the temple, the opposition again came from religion.
[10]  As one who is God, Christ, and the Spirit, Christ is altogether different from the religious world, which lacks God, Christ, and the Spirit.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE PRESENT EVIL AGE 2 CHRIST BEING OPPOSED BY AND
[12]  The Lord Jesus came directly to the religious world.
[13]  However, every time He went to Jerusalem, the center of the religious world, He encountered nothing but debating, fighting, and opposition.
[14]  The Lord brought in a great change from the Old Testament economy to the New Testament economy.
[15]  My burden is that we would see that religion is in our blood.
[16]  They were trying to calm the situation, but the Lord allowed a riot to rise up against Paul, which resulted in his arrest before he completed the purification v. 27 . The Lord did not allow him to be purified in that way, for that was not a purification but a contamination.
[17]  He was weakened by the religious concept in Jerusalem, but the Lord did not tolerate it and sent him far away from Jerusalem to a prison in Rome.
[18]  Although the Lord came directly to the religious world, He did not have rest when He was in Jerusalem, where the temple of God was.
[19]  Christ had no rest in Jerusalem because Judaism had fallen to become a religion in which people who were apparently worshipping God were actually persecuting God by attacking Christ.
[20]  However, Paul s intention in writing Galatians was not merely to expose Judaism as the present section of the evil religious world but rather to use the background of religion to reveal Christ.
[21]  If we are fighting against religion, yet we do not have Christ, even our fighting will eventually become a kind of religion.
[22]  Because Christ was revealed into Paul, he could say, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me 2:20 .
[23]  Christ living in us and our living in Christ and putting on Christ should not be doctrine to us but our daily experience.
[24]  As a result of Christ living in us, our living in Christ, and our putting on Christ, we live Christ and magnify Christ Phil 1:20-21 .
[25]  In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.
[26]  If we return to religion, we are separated from Christ.
[27]  In today s recovery God wants a group of people who are Christ-conscious living by Christ, walking with Christ, loving Christ, dealing with Christ, and remaining in Christ s presence all the time.
[28]  As the Lord is going on, we need to be clear about the nature, position, and function of the church as well as the history of the church.
[29]  The church is a constitution of Christ, the produce of Christ, Christ s multiplication.
[30]  At that time they became the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, to be a corporate expression of God in Christ on earth Eph 1:22-23 .
[31]  One hundred years later, in 1827, the Lord raised up the British or Plymouth Brethren under the leadership of John Nelson Darby.
[32]  They took a stand to practice the church life.
[33]  The light became clearer in this second practice of the church life in the Lord s recovery.
[34]  In 1926 Brother Nee received a burden to move to Shanghai, and the church life there began by 1927.
[35]  About five years later, in 1932, the Lord touched me, and a church was raised up in my hometown of Chefoo.
[36]  The Spread of the Lord s Recovery to the West
[37]  Because he knew life, the Lord, and the Bible, Brother Nee was clear about the Lord s move, and he realized that some day the recovery would spread to the Western world.
[38]  Also, the situation in China did not encourage us to go abroad because the work in China was full of God s blessing, and there was much work to do.
[39]  The crucial point of Brother Nee s ministry was to minister Christ as life to produce the church, which is the Body and the fullness of Christ expressed in many localities.
[40]  The Lord s ministry is to minister Christ as life and everything to His believers so that the church would be produced as a living expression of Christ on the earth in many localities.
[41]  The Christ who is versus religion is not the objective, doctrinal Christ but the subjective, experiential Christ.
[42]  To love others apart from the Spirit is religion, and not to love others apart from the Spirit is also religion.
