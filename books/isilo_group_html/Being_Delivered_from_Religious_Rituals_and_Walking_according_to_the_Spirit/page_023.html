<p>The believers in the Bible are not the only ones who were subdued by the law. We also have laws, and we probably have more laws than Moses enacted. For example, our meetings have a set procedure that we have practiced for nearly twenty years. For the past twenty years this procedure has not changed. Our way of meeting has become an established rule that cannot be changed. This is what we call regulations, rules, customs, habits, and practices. This is the law.</p>
<p>We praise the Lord that He came in to disturb us. In the United States He led us to call, &ldquo;O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; When the saints began to call on the Lord in a released way, they were enlivened. This &ldquo;wind&rdquo; gradually blew to other places, and it also blew to Taiwan. Many religious and law-keeping saints could not take this practice. They said that this cannot be called Sunday worship and that in order to have proper worship, everyone should be quiet. They could not tolerate the noise. As a result, some saints are for being quiet, and others are for being loud.</p>
<p>According to church history, believers are divided into sects and groups because they have differing laws. For example, when some believers in a group insist on worshipping in a certain way, but others in the same group insist on worshipping in a different way, the result is division. In the past there was a Christian group in which some of the believers would shake when they met to worship. There were also believers in that group who were opposed to shaking, so they told those who wanted to shake to go somewhere else. This is the way that the Society of Friends, or Quakers, was formed.</p>
<p>Here is another example. In a Christian group in the United States there were believers who responded with Amen when others prayed. This disturbed other believers in the group. Instead of asking the believers who said Amen to leave, they set aside a corner and named it the &ldquo;Amen corner.&rdquo; Those who wanted to say Amen had to sit in that corner.</p>
<p>When we began to practice calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, problems arose among the churches. Some saints said that they did not agree with the noise. They could not agree, because they had a concept concerning our practice; they had a law. However, calling on the Lord loudly has gradually become a kind of law. It seems as though some saints are not satisfied unless they call on the Lord loudly. They are not happy to call quietly. As a result, among us a quiet group and a loud group have emerged. The quiet ones keep the law of being quiet, and the loud ones keep the law of being loud. This is a problem.</p>
<p>Everything we handle can become a law. Even in the matter of serving the Lord, we attempt to use methods. These methods are a kind of law. When I fellowship with the co-workers and elders, I often ask, &ldquo;How should we do this? What should we do?&rdquo; It seems as though I am asking for methods. We simply cannot stay away from methods. Even our pray-reading has become a method. Formerly, we read the Bible in one way, and now we read the Bible in another way. In every locality the saints pray-read in the same flavor, following the same procedure. We need to release our spirit. However, I am concerned that the way we release our spirit has become a law.</p>
<p>It seems as though whatever we practice becomes a law. Formerly, our prayers were lengthy. The long prayers could be compared to writing a long essay with beautiful words. This intimidated the new believers, and they dared not pray. The long prayers also put the saints to sleep. Few saints attended the prayer meeting because the saints could not endure long prayers. Now the long prayers are gone, and the saints are released. Everyone is praying short prayers, such as &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to be released!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Every saint should be released!&rdquo; However, it would not be wrong to have some longer prayers in addition to the short prayers. This would help us to further touch our spirit. But we are concerned that it would be easy for us to fall into the practice of always having long prayers.</p>
<p>We are surely difficult people who always have the habit of keeping the law. It seems as though we either pray only short prayers or only long prayers. Once a brother said to me, &ldquo;The brothers and sisters in Taiwan are very receptive to your leading. They will follow whichever way you lead.&rdquo; This is true; however, we should not follow in a military way. If a commanding officer says to stand straight, everyone stands straight, and if he says to march, everyone marches with complete uniformity in their steps. This is the law. You may ask, &ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; We should not do anything. We should not ask for a method.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Galatians 3:3 says, &ldquo;Having begun by the Spirit.&rdquo; This points to the fact that our Christian life is altogether a matter of the Spirit. Therefore, we do not need to read the Bible in a certain way; rather, we should be living and have various ways of reading the Bible, just as the wind blows wherever it wills. When we come to the meeting, we should forget about regulations and methods and let the Spirit occupy our being. If we are reading the Bible in the meeting, and a brother feels to stand up and read, he should do so. Some may say that if every saint does this, there will be chaos. If we would all stand up according to the leading of the Spirit, there would not be chaos.</p>
<p>When we are bound by the law, the spirit of the meeting is also bound. Our spirit should be free. When the brothers lead the Scripture reading, every saint should feel free to stand up to read. In this way the meeting will be living. Instead of forms, methods, or rules in our meetings, we should exercise our spirit, fellowship with the Lord, and be prepared to function. Not only should the brothers be prepared to function, but also the sisters should be prepared. There should not be set procedures in the meetings. The meetings should be entirely according to the leading of the Spirit. The meetings should always be different. We do not want methods, nor do we want chaos.</p>
<p>We do not need to use the same procedure to pray-read. There can be many ways to pray-read. Likewise, we do not always have to sing a hymn from the first stanza to the last stanza. We can sing only two stanzas or three stanzas. It may be that while we are singing, a brother stands up and reads a portion of the Scriptures. After he reads, everyone can continue singing. Sometimes a saint can stand up and share a testimony. Our meetings should not follow set rules; instead, everyone should follow the leading of the Spirit. We must all be according to the Spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Delivered from Religious Rituals and Walking according to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
