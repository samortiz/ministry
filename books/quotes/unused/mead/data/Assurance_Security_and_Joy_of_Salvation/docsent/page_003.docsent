   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE JOY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen the assurance of our salvation, that is, how we know that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have also seen the security of our salvation, that is, how we can never lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But is that sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Unfortunately, many Christians are content to go only this far having salvation, but having little joy or enjoyment of that salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our friend with millions in the bank may have the assurance that he is rich, and he may have the security of knowing that his deposit is safe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if he never spends a dime and is content to live a pauper s life, we can hardly say he has the enjoyment of those riches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Objectively speaking he is rich, but in his practical experience he has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the condition of many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are saved, but in their daily life they have little experience of the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, God s intention is that we not only have Christ, but that we enjoy Him, even to the uttermost John 10:10; Phil 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The normal condition of a Christian is to exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory 1 Pet 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But nearly all of us will admit that there are times, even many times, when we do not have this overflowing joy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Does this mean that we have lost our salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our salvation is based upon God, not upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But although we cannot lose our salvation, we can lose the joy of that salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Loss of Joy</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What are the things, then, that cause us to sometimes lose our joy?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first item is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joy depends on our having unbroken fellowship with God, but sin separates us from Him and causes Him to hide His face Isa 59:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second item is grieving the Holy Spirit Eph 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are saved, we become God s temple and have His Spirit indwelling us 1 Cor 6:17, 19; Rom 8:9, 11, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Spirit within is not a force or a thing, but a living person, Jesus Christ Himself 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; 13:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Like every living person, He has feelings and attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, when we speak or do things contrary to Him, He is grieved within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Holy Spirit is grieved, our spirit, which is joined to Him 1 Cor 6:17 , is grieved, and we lose our joy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Maintenance of Joy</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our salvation is like a rock, immovable, but the joy of our salvation is like a delicate flower, easily upset by a little breeze.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, it is something we must cultivate and nourish.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What, then, can we do to maintain this joy?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, we can confess our sins 1 John 1:7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we confess our offenses to the Lord, His blood cleanses us, and our fellowship with Him is restored.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After David sinned, he prayed, Restore to me the gladness of Your salvation Psa 51:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The precious blood of Christ cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, we can take God s Word as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jeremiah said, Your words were found and I ate them, and Your word became to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart Jer 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Often we discover that after reading and praying over God s Word, our heart is bubbling over with enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No famished man is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Likewise, we should not remain famished Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should continually feed and feast on God s Word Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Third, we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Often after opening our heart and speaking out to the Lord, we sense a deep joy and refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Isaiah 56:7 says He will cause us to rejoice in His house of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Real prayer is not the recitation of familiar words and phrases it is a pouring out of our heart and spirit to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus said, Ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full John 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Real prayer is releasing and enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Finally, we can fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The greatest enjoyment for a Christian is to be together with others who love and enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No human words can utter the sweetness we experience when we praise Him and speak about Him together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First John 1:3-4 says, That you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And these things we write that our joy may be made full.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Real fellowship is not a duty, but an enjoyment the greatest joy on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, we have the assurance, the security, and the joy of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praise Him for such a full salvation!</S>
