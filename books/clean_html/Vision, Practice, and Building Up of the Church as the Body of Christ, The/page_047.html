<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS IN THE HUMAN LIFE AND CHURCH LIFE BY OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>According to the six chapters of Ephesians, our spirit must be enlightened to be a spirit of wisdom and revelation; this is the beginning of God&rsquo;s dwelling within us. Our spirit must also be strengthened so that Christ may gain more ground to take possession of our whole being. This spirit becomes the spirit of our mind to take over, subdue, and control our mind. Then we need to be filled in our spirit and pray at every time in our spirit. If we have such a spirit, we will have no problems with the building up of the church. If a husband and wife have a spirit that is always enlightened by God and full of wisdom and revelation, a spirit that is the dwelling place of God, a strengthened spirit that always gives Christ more ground within them, a spirit that takes possession of their mind, a spirit that is filled, and a praying spirit, they will have no problems in their marriage life. All the problems among the married couples come only when they are out of their spirit.</p>
<p>When I was younger, brothers and sisters would come to me with the troubles of their marriage life and family life. At that time I always told them to open their Bible to Ephesians 5:24-25. They already received the teaching from this passage on their wedding day, but I would try my best to remind them of it. This was foolish. Every time I did this, I failed myself and I failed them. I failed in this way for a period of many years. Eventually I learned that such teaching does not work. There is another verse in Ephesians 5, verse 18, which says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit.&rdquo; Their problem was that they were out of the spirit. If they would simply return to the spirit, open to the Lord, and speak to Him, their problems would be solved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE POINT OF VIEW OF OUR SPIRIT<br />
TO PRACTICE RELATEDNESS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>A marriage life is a related life. Many times a husband does not tell his wife before he goes somewhere. Sometimes wives also act independently. This is because they have not realized that after being married, they now have a related life. After getting married, a husband must not only tell his dear wife where he is going, but he may also need to ask her permission. In order to be a good husband or wife, one must always go to his or her spouse before doing anything. To keep the relatedness in this way removes all the misunderstandings. It causes the family life to be full of joy and the husbands and wives to be happy with each other.</p>
<p>In the same way, the church life is also a related life, an enlarged marriage life and family life. Therefore, we all need to learn to be related. However, whenever we are in our mind, we are separated, not related. Relatedness can be realized only in our spirit. This is not mere knowledge; it is something practical for the building up of the church. Sometimes we may say, &ldquo;Let us come together and thoroughly discuss the situation.&rdquo; This may help in a small way, but we need to be careful. The more we talk in the mind, the more problems we have. When we have a problem, the secret is to say, &ldquo;Brothers, let us stop our talking and pray a little.&rdquo; We need to stop the exercise of the mind and pray. To pray is to come back to the spirit and exercise the spirit. After everyone prays, we are restored to oneness. Whenever we come back to the spirit, we are immediately in the oneness.</p>
<p>We may again illustrate this with the marriage life. Whenever husbands and wives are not happy with each other, they are in the soul, either the mind or the emotions. The problem is never with the spirit. The best way to help the situation is for them to turn from the mind and the emotions to the spirit. If they turn to the spirit, they will be happy. When a husband is in his mind or emotion, he looks at his wife from the angle of the mind and emotion. When you look at my face from the front, you can see my eyes, but when you look from behind, you see only my hair. In the same principle, if a brother looks at his wife from the point of view of his mind, he will quickly become unhappy with her. However, when he turns to his spirit, he looks at his wife from another angle. His view is different because his angle has changed.</p>
<p>Many times we have problems with the dear ones in the church life simply because we exercise our mind too much. The more we exercise our mind to look at the brothers and sisters, the more problems we have. We need to turn to our spirit whenever we have any problem with the brothers and sisters. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, help me not to look at my brothers and sisters in the mind. Help me to turn to the spirit and consider the saints from my spirit.&rdquo; Then we will see from another angle. The situation will still be the same, but our view will be changed. The reason it is easy to be angry with people is that we are too much in the emotion. If we turn to the spirit, however, our angle will change, so our view of the saints will be different.</p>
