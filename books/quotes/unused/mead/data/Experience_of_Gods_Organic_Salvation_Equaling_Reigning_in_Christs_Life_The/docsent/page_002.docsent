   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S ORGANIC SALVATION EQUALING REIGNING IN CHRIST S LIFE MESSAGE ONE GOD S ORGANIC SALVATION 1 REGENERATION AND RENEWING OUTLINE God regenerates us that we may have His divine life the base of God s organic salvation Titus 3:5; John 3:3, 16, 36a: As the base for us to grow in the divine life: The Spirit of God regenerates us in our spirit with the divine life: That we may be born of God as God s species John 1:13.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That, in addition to our natural life, we may have the divine, eternal life of God John 3:16, 36a as the basis and means of our spiritual life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We not only receive the divine life through regeneration but also grow in the divine life with regeneration as the base: By being nourished with the supply of the milk of the word of God unto our daily, gradual salvation 1 Pet 2:2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through denying our natural life to live by the divine life Matt 16:24.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the base for us to be built up in the divine life: We are being built up in the divine life by the growth and increase of the divine life in us Col 2:19; Eph 4:15-16.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this divine building up, which is based on the growth of the divine life, the regenerated believers as Christ s brothers and members Heb 2:11; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:27 are constituted into the Body of Christ as the increase and fullness of the unlimited Christ John 3:30a; Eph 1:23 for the achievement of the purpose of God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God renews us that we may become His divine, new creation the building up of God s organic salvation Rom 12:2b; Titus 3:5c; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15: That we may be built up in the divine, new creation: Through regeneration we have been created in Christ into one new man Eph 2:15; Col 3:10 as God s new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this new creation is out of God s old creation, of which so many old elements should be renewed to become new.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In fact, the creation of the new man has been completed by Christ on the cross Eph 2:15 ; but in practicality, having been made the members of the new man, we should apply to ourselves what Christ has completed by being practically renewed in our living that we may be built up in the divine, new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That we may be built up in God s organic salvation: In God s organic salvation, regeneration is a washing, and renewing is the continuation of the washing of regeneration Titus 3:5.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The means of renewing in God s organic salvation: By the renewing Spirit Titus 3:5 mingling with our regenerated spirit as one spirit to spread into our mind Eph 4:22-24 and infuse our inward parts with God s attributes, which are forever new and never become old, thereby renewing our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By our walking in newness of the divine life in the resurrection of Christ Rom 6:4.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By our being consumed by the environmental sufferings for the killing of our outer man and the renewing of our inner man day by day 2 Cor 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through such a renewing we are built up in God s organic salvation to ultimately become as new as the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Prayer: Lord, You are the Christ; we worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your economy, Your plan in eternity, is for the manifestation of Your glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, we pray that You will support us and give us the Spirit from heaven and the words that are of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We pray also that You will release new light and new revelation here all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The general subject of this series of messages is The Experience of God s Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ s Life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may use the following statements as a summarized explanation of this subject:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God regenerates us that we may have His divine life and renews us that we may become His divine, new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature and transforms us that we may have His divine image.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God conforms us that we may have His divine element and glorifies us that we may have His divine image in full.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We reign in God s life by His organic salvation to accomplish His eternal economy and achieve His divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this message, the first message on God s organic salvation, we would like to see the matters of regeneration and renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not easy to speak such messages, but each message has an outline that can help us enter into the content of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, today I am not speaking to you in the way of delivering a message.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, I will speak item by item according to the message outline.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that you will try your best to follow me in each point.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every item mentioned in these outlines is a development, and the ultimate issue of this development is the New Jerusalem, which is an indescribable constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never consider that the New Jerusalem is a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The New Jerusalem is an indescribable constitution of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As such, it can be understood only according to the revelation of the Holy Spirit, and it cannot be expressed with human words.</S>
