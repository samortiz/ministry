   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPRESSING CHRIST WITHOUT LIMITATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To magnify Christ is to express Christ without limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is to show to the whole universe that the very Christ who is our life and by whom we live is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the human concept, Christ is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when people see us living by Him, they will realize that He is not limited.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the Apostle Paul had not been put in prison, no one would have understood how unlimited Christ was.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was through Paul's imprisonment that the Christ by whom Paul lived was expressed as the unlimited One.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because Paul's endurance was Christ Himself, it would have been impossible to exhaust his endurance no matter how long Paul had been kept in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, it was inexhaustible and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes Christians ask others to pray for them because they are coming to the end of their endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such endurance is not Christian endurance, for it is not endurance magnified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Christ whom we experience as endurance cannot be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we live by Him, He will be magnified; that is, He will show forth His inexhaustlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Paul's endurance was Christ, it was unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such an unlimited endurance is the magnification of the unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To the universe, this is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Like endurance, our faithfulness, patience, and humility must also be unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Any attribute we have through living by Christ will be unlimited and thus mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By this we can see the difference between the human virtues and the virtues that are the magnification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All human virtues are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, human tolerance will eventually be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the very magnification of Christ lived out of us cannot be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This mystery subdues the Devil, the demons, and all the evil angels.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It also convinces everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any proper human being will be convinced by seeing the magnification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our Christian patience is a mystery because it is the magnification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not merely Christ manifested; it is Christ manifested as the unlimited One.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even our forgiveness of others needs to be a magnification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew 18 Peter asked the Lord how many times he should forgive his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He asked if he should forgive him even seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Lord told him that he must forgive seventy times seven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is inexhaustible forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such forgiveness is the magnification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our forgiveness is the inexhaustible Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Again and again, throughout the years, we forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This unlimited forgiveness is Christ magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>SUFFERING TO MAGNIFY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the Christian virtues should be inexhaustible, often God will not reduce our sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, in order to magnify Christ, often He will increase them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to magnify Christ, it is necessary that we suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose you pray, "O God, my Father, You are kind and merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You know that I cannot endure very much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please reduce my suffering."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God answered your prayer and reduced your suffering, Christ would not be magnified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need the sufferings for the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As our sufferings increase, Christ is magnified all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, do not be concerned about what kind of suffering enables us to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead of analyzing this matter, we should simply love the Lord and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When sufferings increase, we may think that our heavenly Father is cruel and merciless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Remember, this word about magnifying Christ was spoken by someone in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The longer he was in prison, the more he magnified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be magnified means to be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we have pointed out, to magnify Christ means to express Him as the One who is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is magnified through the increase of our sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not be afraid of suffering, for it is a joy to magnify Christ through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many Christian teachers realize that the book of Philippians is a book of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Over and over again, in this book Paul tells us to rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we are in a pleasant environment, it may not mean very much to be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But to rejoice when we are in prison means a great deal.</S>
