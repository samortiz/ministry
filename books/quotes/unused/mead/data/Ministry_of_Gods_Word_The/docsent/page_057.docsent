   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEMORY IN THE QUOTING OF SCRIPTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should also pay attention to the matter of quoting the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In delivering God s word, we have to follow the example of the apostles who quoted from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we speak on a certain subject, we should quote from the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In speaking God s word, we must have the written Bible as our basis.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should base our speaking on the Old Testament as well as the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But there is a problem today: If we are not careful, we can be led astray by the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In quoting from the Old and the New Testaments, we may get carried away by the quotations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may miss what we intend to speak in the first place, and when we return home, our burden becomes even heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times while we are speaking, we have no control over our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is easy for us to speak on an Old Testament passage or a New Testament passage and then get carried away by it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We wonder why we feel heavier and heavier as we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we return home, we feel condemned; we feel that we have wasted time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have expounded the Scripture and explained the doctrine, but we have not discharged the burden that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in our speaking, we have to learn to continually check whether or not the burden is unloaded.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say this or that, and we may quote from the Old Testament and the New Testament, but all these are peripheral to the purpose of bringing out God s present word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Unless there is God s present word, there is no need for us to speak at all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not have God s present word, we would do just as well if we came together and studied the Scripture together without any special speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must not be satisfied with just repeating something in the Old Testament and the New Testament; we must release our own words as well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ministry of the word is a very subjective thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to speak God s past words, and we have to speak God s present words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must not only speak about the Old Testament and the New Testament; we have to come back to our own words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can say something through the Old Testament, and we can say something through the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we also have to say what we need to say.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our words have to be strong and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should release what we want to say sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As each sentence is released, we touch the right spot, and more life is released.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The burden is gradually discharged, and it is fully discharged when the message is done.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may feel that our utterance is short, but our burden is discharged; we have done what we needed to do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Following this, we will see the fruit in others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One thing is certain: Where there is the discharge of a burden, God s children will see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they do not see the light, it is their problem, not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if we cannot discharge our burden, then the problem lies with us, not them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must realize before the Lord that a minister of the word should always be burdened with words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Speaking is for the discharge of a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to discharge a burden, we must have the Spirit s memory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the Spirit s memory, we cannot discharge our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even when the Spirit s memory is fresh, we must still be careful not to be carried away by the truths of the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should always remember that our burden is to bring God s present word to men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not merely expound the Bible, while forgetting what we are supposed to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we forget the words that we are supposed to speak, we will find that we still have not said that very thing even after we have said everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is possible that there may be a hindrance from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In any case, our thought has to be rich, and our memory has to be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to be rich in everything before we can release our burden through our speaking.</S>
