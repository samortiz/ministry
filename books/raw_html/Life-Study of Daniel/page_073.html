<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. Being a Type of Antichrist</H2><P>In all the abovementioned evils, Antiochus Epiphanes was a type of Antichrist, who will come in the last week of the seventy weeks (9:27; Matt. 24:15; 2 Thes. 2:3b-4; Rev. 13:4-7).</P><P>Whereas verses 21 through 35 of Daniel 11 refer to Antiochus Epiphanes, verses 36 through 45 refer to Antichrist. Antichrist will have no regard for anyone or anything; he will do as he pleases. He will exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and against the God of gods he will speak extraordinary things (v. 36). He will not regard the gods of his fathers or the desire of women, nor will he regard any other god, for he will magnify himself above all (v. 37). He will honor instead a god of fortresses, and he will take action against the most fortified of fortresses with the help of a foreign god (vv. 38-39). At the time of the end, the king of the south will push against him, and the king of the north will storm back at him. He will enter the countries and overflow and pass through (v. 40). After entering the beautiful land, he will stretch out his hand against the countries (vv. 41-42). But news from the east and from the north will trouble him, and he will go forth with great wrath destroying and exterminating many (v. 44). He will pitch the tents of his palace between the Mediterranean Sea and the beautiful mountain of Zion; but he will come to his end, and there will be none to help him (v. 45).</P><P>Antichrist will come to his end when Christ as the stone cut out without hands comes with His bride to smash the great human image from the toes to the head. During the church age, the age of mystery, Christ is building up the church to be His bride. In Revelation 19 Christ will marry His bride and then come with her as His army to deal with Antichrist and his armies, which will be gathered around the city of Jerusalem. Since Antichrist will not believe in God or Christ but only in himself, the appearing of Christ with His bride will be a great surprise to Antichrist and his followers. For his enjoyment Antichrist will pitch the tents of his palace between the Mediterranean Sea and the beautiful holy mountain. At that juncture Christ will come with His bride to bring Antichrist to his end.</P><P>According to the Bible, Antichrist will destroy the temple in Jerusalem. The first temple was built by Solomon, and that temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. Then after seventy years, Cyrus the king of Persia released the captives of Israel to return to their fathers' land to rebuild the temple. Eventually, Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of the king of the north, utterly desecrated the temple, profaning it with idolatry, fornication, and unclean offerings. The Maccabees defeated this king and cleansed the temple. That cleansing was a justification, declaring that the temple was the holy place for God's people to worship Him. After Christ's death, Titus came with the Roman army and destroyed the temple again in A.D. 70. According to the Bible, there will be a fourth destruction of the temple by Antichrist in the middle of the last seven years of this age.</P><P>All these cases show us that the center, the aim, and the goal of Satan's struggle against God is related to the temple. God desires to have a place on earth for His people to worship Him, as a testimony that He still has an interest on this earth. But Satan is always struggling to destroy this place. If we see this, it will help us to understand the Bible.</P>
