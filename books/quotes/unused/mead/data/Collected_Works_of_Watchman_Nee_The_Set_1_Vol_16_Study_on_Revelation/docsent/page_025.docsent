   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Where do they go to?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 6:17 says, "Who is able to stand?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet these people in 7:9-17 are able to stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God gave the promise of rapture only to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, only the church is able to stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 When will God return to take care of the Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in Rom 11:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 7:9-17 must refer to the people in Romans 11:25.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These people are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>5 Regarding the twenty-four elders, the four living creatures, and the one hundred and forty-four thousand, no mention is made of being purchased by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only these people were purchased by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>6 Although to be clothed in white garments was what God promised the church in Sardis, both Sardis and Philadelphia put together could not have produced such a large number.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>None could have such a glorious destiny but the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, this must be the scene of those in the church who were raptured to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>7 The angels' attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first sentence which all the angels say is, "Amen" 7:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is great joy in heaven over one sinner who repents Luke 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When all the angels see so many people coming, they cannot help praising for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>8 Their garments were cleansed by the blood 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only the church has this kind of special condition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>9 The scene in Revelation 7:15-17 is similar to the scene of eternity in Revelation 21:3-7.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The overcoming in Revelation 21:7 is an overcoming by faith 1 John 5:4 , since Revelation 21:6 states, "I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some have argued that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation and that the people mentioned here are those who are saved during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, this argument cannot stand for the following reasons:</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1 This school proposes is that the twenty-four elders in chapters four and five represent the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So the whole church should already be raptured by this time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know that this is basically wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The reasons have already been given in the discussion on chapter four concerning the twenty-four elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2 In Revelation 7:9 no one could number the great multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us ask if during the tribulation, under such great persecution, there could be so many people receiving salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The total population of the whole world is 1.7 billion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we can subtract the dead ones which can be counted in this book, how many do we still have?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Revelation 6:8 the fourth part of men were killed, about four hundred million dead ones, leaving approximately 1.2 billion alive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Again, the third part of men were killed in 9:15 and 18, approximately four hundred million men, leaving eight hundred million men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition to that number, in Revelation 8:9 there were men who died because ships were destroyed; in 8:11 many men died because the waters became wormwood; and in 11:13 many died of earthquakes, among whom were numbered seven thousand men of renown.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mr. Govett did some research and concluded that the original language referred to these men as men of renown.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How many more died, who were not men of renown?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, no one knows how many were killed during the final tribulations in chapters fifteen and sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the number of the army of horsemen in Revelation 9:16 was two hundred million, if we subtract from the remaining eight hundred million men these two hundred million horsemen, we are left with only six hundred million men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we further subtract from these six hundred million the above unaccounted-for number, what is left is much less.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, even if all those who survive the great tribulation were saved, the number would not be so many that no one could number.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3 By this time the great tribulation has not arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not until Revelation 8:1 that the seventh seal is opened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first four trumpets which come after that are merely calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only by the time of the fifth trumpet do we have the beginning of the trumpets of woes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps this is the beginning of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The seventh trumpet is undoubtedly in the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How then can there be people who are saved during the tribulation, when the tribulation has not even come yet?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>4 Revelation 7:9 says, "Before the throne."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If it were not for the rapture, how could anyone be in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet during the great tribulation, no one will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is the only group that will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>5 In the whole Bible, no mention is made of such a great revival during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A biblical prophecy never stands by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is always confirmed by other books.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Second Peter 1:20 is definitely a rule of interpreting prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the principle according to which the Holy Spirit writes the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, these people do not refer to the believers who are saved during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The phrase "standing before the throne" in Revelation 7:9 only tells us of the fact of the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It does not tell us the process of their rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"White robes" here refer to the purity of their conduct as a result of the cleansing by the blood v. 14 . The white garments in Revelation 3:4 are a promise which corresponds with that mentioned in Revelation 19:8.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This refers to their victory on earth, that is, their purity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the future this will be manifested in the heavens and enjoyed in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The white garments in 4:4 speak of the elders who are without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The white robes in 6:11 refer to the martyrs' acceptance by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The "palm branches" in 7:9 signify victory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The feast of tabernacles in Leviticus 23:39-43 uses palm branches.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The feast of tabernacles shows that God wants to live with His people temporarily on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This foreshadows the millennium.</S>
