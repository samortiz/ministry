<h2 class="head4">b. God as the Husband and His People as the Wife</h2><p>Several times in the Old Testament God referred to Himself as the Husband and to His people as His wife (Isa. 54:5; 62:5; Jer. 2:2; 3:1, 14; 31:32; Ezek. 16:8; 23:5; Hosea 2:7, 19). God was desirous of being a husband and of having His people as His wife. Many times the prophets spoke of God as the Husband and of His people as His wife. Humanly speaking, we always think of God in a religious way as the Almighty, feeling compelled to worship Him. But do you married brothers expect this from your wives? Suppose your wife thought of you as a big body, as a giant, approaching you adoringly, bowing herself, and kneeling down to worship you. What would you say? You would say, &ldquo;Silly wife, I don&rsquo;t need such a worshipper. I need a dear wife to embrace me and kiss me. If you will simply give me a little kiss, I will soar in the air.&rdquo; Our God certainly is the Almighty God, and, as His creatures, we must worship Him. Many verses speak about worshipping God in this way. However, have you never read in Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea that God desires to be a husband? In ancient times God&rsquo;s people built the temple and established a system of worship complete with priesthood and sacrifices. One day God intervened and spoke through Isaiah saying, &ldquo;I am tired of this. I am weary with your sacrifices. I want you to love Me. I am your Husband, and you must be My wife. I want to have a marriage life. I am lonely. I need you. I need you, My chosen people, to be My wife.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Full Romance in Song of Songs</h2><p>Among the 39 books in the Old Testament, there is one book called the Song of Songs. Song of Songs is more than a romance; it is a fantastic romance. Have you ever read a romance like the Song of Songs? As far as I am concerned, the Song of Songs is the finest romance. It speaks of two people who fall in love. Although I do not like to use this term, &ldquo;fall in love,&rdquo; I cannot deny the fact. In Song of Songs we find a woman falling in love with a man saying, &ldquo;Oh, that he might kiss me with the kisses of his mouth. I am thirsty for this.&rdquo; Immediately, her beloved is at hand, and the pronoun changes from &ldquo;he&rdquo; to &ldquo;you&rdquo; (S. S. 1:2-3). &ldquo;Your name is sweet, and your love is better than wine. Draw me, my beloved. Don&rsquo;t teach me, draw me. I don&rsquo;t need a pastor or a preacher. I don&rsquo;t need an elder or even an apostle. I need you to draw me. Draw me, we will run after you.&rdquo; What a romance!</p><p>In the case of Adam and Eve we saw that the couple had one source, one nature, one life, and one living. In Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea we saw that God desires to have a wife who will live together with Him. God longs to have a marriage life, to have divinity live together with humanity. But His people failed Him. In Song of Songs, however, we see the genuine marriage life. What is the secret of such a romance? The secret is that the wife must take her husband not only as her life and her living, but as her person.</p><p>As we pointed out during the informal training of 1972, the Lord used several figures of speech to characterize His seeker in Song of Songs as she passed through the various stages in the growth of life. The first figure He used was of a company of horses (S. S. 1:9). Horses are strong, energetic, full of personality, and seek a definite goal of their own. Gradually, by the working of love, this seeker was changed from a company of horses to a lily that was fragrant, beautiful, and blossoming (S. S. 2:2). The seeker became a lily without will, emotion, or person. Eventually, she became a pillar. Although the word pillar denotes something strong, the seeker was likened to a pillar of smoke (S. S. 3:6), not a pillar of marble. She was a pillar of smoke that stood erect and steadfast in the universe; yet she was very flexible. I like to see young wives being pillars of smoke saying, &ldquo;My will is in my husband&rsquo;s heart, my emotion is in him, and my mind is in his head. I am simply a pillar of smoke.&rdquo; A pillar of smoke has no person of its own; it has no mind, emotion, and will. When the husband says to such a wife, &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; she will instantly obey. On the contrary, if the husband should say, &ldquo;Let us stay here for eternity,&rdquo; there will be no problem. However, the reports that I receive about the young couples are absolutely different from this. If the brother says, &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; the wife refuses. If the husband says, &ldquo;Let us stay,&rdquo; the wife insists on going. She is still a wild horse from Egypt pulling Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariot. Such a sister may be seeking the Lord, but she carries Pharaoh. She needs to be unloaded. How? By losing her mind, will, and emotion and becoming a pillar of smoke.</p><p>The seeking one in Song of Songs eventually becomes a palanquin to carry her beloved (S. S. 3:9). She no longer has a person of her own; her beloved, Christ the Lord, is now the Person within her. She herself is a palanquin bearing the Person of Christ. Later, this seeker becomes a garden growing something to satisfy her beloved (S. S. 4:12-13). Finally, she becomes the city (S. S. 6:4), the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2), without any person of her own, but with the strong Person of Christ within her. Praise the Lord! This is the holy romance.</p>
