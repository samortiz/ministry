   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sending His Son in the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin That He Might Redeem Those under Law That We Might Receive the Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin that He might redeem those under law so that we might receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 8:3 speaks of "God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The flesh is of sin, and the Son of God did indeed become flesh John 1:14; Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but had no participation in the sin of the flesh 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was typified by the brass serpent lifted up by Moses for sinful Israelites Num 21:9; John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The brass serpent was in the form, the likeness, of an actual serpent, but it did not have the poison of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In like manner, Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the sinful nature of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The subject of Romans 8:3 is God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knew that He could not send His Son to be the flesh of sin, for, if He did that, His Son would have been involved with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, He sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, as typified by the brass serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ does not have the nature of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God sent Him only in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin in order to redeem us from under the law so that we might receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Galatians 4:4 and 5 say, "When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fullness of time in verse 4 denotes the completion of the Old Testament time, which occurred at the time appointed of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this verse Paul describes the Son as "come of a woman, come under law."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The woman is, of course, the virgin Mary Luke 1:27-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son of God came of her to be the seed of woman, as promised in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, Christ was born under law, as revealed in Luke 2:21-24, 27, and He kept the law, as the four Gospels reveal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's chosen people were shut up by the law under its custody Gal 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ was born under the law in order to redeem them from its custody so that they might receive the sonship and become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, God's economy is to produce sons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sonship is the focal point of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's New Testament economy is the dispensing of Himself into His chosen people to make them His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ's redemption is to bring us into the sonship of God so that we may enjoy the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's New Testament economy is not to make us keepers of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's New Testament economy is to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God's promise, which was given for His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression Rom 8:29; Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship Eph 1:5 and regenerated us to be His sons John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Galatians 4:4 says that God sent forth His Son when the fullness of the time had come.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God sent Christ at exactly the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Earlier would have been too soon, and later would have been too late.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ came when the time was right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was at the appointed time, at the fullness of time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, the Son's coming was full of meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, God sent John the Baptist to prepare the way for Christ, and then He sent His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God sent His Son that we might receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To receive the sonship is to receive the dispensing of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the sending of both John the Baptist and of Christ were for the dispensing of the divine life into God's chosen people.</S>
