   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Small Group Meetings and the Truth Lessons</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is one important principle that we must keep in the small group meetings and the truth classes: Everyone must speak, but no one should preach from Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the truth classes we do not need to expand or supplement Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the small group meetings we should encourage everyone to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In all the places that are practicing the truth classes, some are doing it rightly, but others are doing it wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every lesson of Truth Lessons is a good message.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The main points, the lines of thought, and the material presented are very rich; they are more than what an ordinary believer can absorb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You must trust me that everything that should be included was included when we compiled Truth Lessons, and everything that should not be there was excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not believe that anyone, myself included, can give another message as good as the printed lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The subject matter is well organized, and the content is concise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, the teachers do not need to expand, expound, or supplement these lessons with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes a short passage contains a tremendous amount of material.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am afraid that some brothers have been elders for many years, but they still do not understand the material contained in the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In teaching the truth classes, the first ones we should teach are ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need to preach the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All we must do is study and memorize them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need to engage in a long discourse regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All we must do is help everyone to absorb the points and remember them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need to add or delete anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The outstanding point about Truth Lessons is that it presents to the reader the truths in the Lord s recovery level by level, from the most simple to the most advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have been in the Lord s recovery for many years, but many of us still do not quite understand the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our understanding is very general.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know something, but we do not know it in depth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since we are saved and by the Lord s mercy we are in His recovery, we should receive some basic education in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, all of us need to know the origin and functions of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are all found in Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All we need to do is study and memorize them, and then teach the saints to repeat-read, emphasize-read, pray-read, and vitalize-read them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the saints can continue steadfastly in this matter, and if they go through one lesson a week, in four years all of them will become scholars.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They will be rooted in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will fill up the lack we have had in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past some of you listened to messages for more than twenty years, but you still did not know the origin and the functions of the Bible, and you still did not know that Satan is both an enemy and an adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All you knew were such terms as bearing the cross, loving the Lord, and the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is like some who teach arithmetic for years but teach only simple counting; they do not advance to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we must overturn our past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must not repeat the past.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consider the educational system in our society.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A man does not receive a good education by listening to famous speakers every day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, he learns by going to school day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he merely listens to lectures day by day, he will not graduate from school, and he will not learn anything solid.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will greatly affect his family, society, and nation as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The teaching of the truth lessons may appear dull, but in four years it will lay a firm foundation in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today in Taiwan we have intercollegiate college entrance examinations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If all our schools did not teach according to the syllabus, and if every class went according to the way it pleased, how could students pass these entrance examinations?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today among us we do not have any examinations; we do not know how much truth the saints know and how much experience they have in their daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we test everyone on matters such as the cross, resurrection, and the functions of the Bible, I wonder how many would pass.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a great lack among us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I only wish that I could overturn all our practices.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now that Truth Lessons is printed, I hope that this situation will change.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In education, the first thing to take care of is the students.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are teaching in a primary school, we need to use a primary school curriculum.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot teach with the material we use in a doctorate degree seminar.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the reason that I need to repeat what I have said, that in teaching the truth we must not enter into a lengthy discourse.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All we need to do is read, ask some questions, and repeat a little when we come to the crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may have a doctor among us, but we must remember that we are teaching the truth; we are not training people to become doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not need to use our own material to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, teach according to the Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the same time, you need to encourage the saints to attend the small group meetings, and you need to make everyone speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In particular, those who do not usually speak must open their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who always speak should be advised in private to speak less and to give more opportunity for others to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They may be full of words, but in order for others to be perfected, they should be advised to exercise some restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Encourage those who speak little or who do not speak at all to speak more, and the small group meetings will become living.</S>
