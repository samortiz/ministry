<h2 class="head5">The Preparation</h2>
<p>Even though David had this desire, God did not allow David to build a house for Him because David had shed blood abundantly and waged great wars (1 Chron. 22:7-8). In typology, this refers to Christ in His suffering before He entered into glory. He was not able to build the temple until He entered into glory. As long as Christ stayed in His suffering, the church could not be produced. In God&rsquo;s ordination, David could not build the temple. Instead, he did the preparation work.</p>
<h2 class="head6">The Materials</h2>
<p>First Chronicles 22:14 speaks of David&rsquo;s preparation of the materials. David told Solomon, &ldquo;Now then in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah...gold...silver and bronze and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; and timber and stone I have prepared.&rdquo; In his affliction David prepared all the materials for the building of the temple. According to typology, in His affliction Christ prepared all the materials for the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head6">The Site</h2>
<p>David not only prepared the materials but also the site for the building of the temple. The site was the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite (21:18-30). When Solomon&rsquo;s time came, he simply carried out the building work. This indicates that in His suffering Christ prepared everything&mdash;both the materials and the site&mdash;needed for the building of the church. Thus, when Christ entered into glory, He could begin to build. David told Solomon that the materials that he had prepared were sufficient but that Solomon could add to them (22:14). In reality, most of the materials were prepared in David&rsquo;s time. In principle, this shows that Christ in His suffering prepared all that was needed for the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Solomon</h2>
<p>In typology, Solomon and David signify two aspects of one person. David typifies Christ in His sufferings, and Solomon typifies Christ in His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Being Glorified</h2>
<p>After Solomon was made king, the first thing he did was build the temple. This means that as soon as Christ entered into glory, He produced the church. Christ&rsquo;s glorification is recorded at the end of the Gospels (Matt. 28; Mark 16:6-20; Luke 24:46-51; John 20:19-31). Then in the beginning of Acts, the church was produced. As recorded in Acts 2, the church was produced on the day of Pentecost. This can be compared to the day on which Solomon completed the temple. Solomon&rsquo;s being made king and his enthronement were his exaltation and glorification by the Israelites; these were absolutely related to the building of the temple. Likewise, Christ&rsquo;s exaltation and glorification are absolutely related to the producing and building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Building the Temple</h2>
<p>As soon as Solomon was made king, he built the temple (1 Kings 6). This typifies that as soon as Christ was glorified, He produced the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Ark Entering the Temple</h2>
<p>After Solomon completed the temple, the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah into it. On the day when the temple was dedicated to God, it was filled with the glory of God (8:6, 10). God obtained a dwelling place on the earth and caused His glory to fill it. Once the temple was built up and God obtained a dwelling on earth, He could fully express His glory. The temple&rsquo;s dedication is a type of the day of Pentecost; once the church was produced on the earth, the glory of God was expressed on the earth and filled the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Building Materials</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Preparation and Obtaining of the Materials</h2>
<p>The materials for the building of the temple were prepared in part by David and in part by Solomon. If we carefully read 1 Kings 5 through 6 and 1 Chronicles 22, 28, and 29, we will see that David prepared most of the materials for the building of the temple and that Solomon prepared a small part. David plus Solomon typify the complete Christ. David typifies Christ in His death; thus, everything prepared by David typifies what Christ obtained in His death. Likewise, Solomon typifies Christ in His resurrection; everything Solomon prepared typifies what Christ obtained in His resurrection. Hence, the obtaining of the materials for the building of the church depends on Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Most of these materials were obtained by Christ&rsquo;s death, and a small part was obtained by His resurrection.</p>
