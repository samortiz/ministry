   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PASSOVER, THE MANNA, AND THE LAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In writing 1 Corinthians Paul also used pictures from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians 5:7 we see that Christ is the Passover, and in 10:3 and 4, that He is the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the pictures in the Old Testament, it was by the passover lamb that the children of Israel were delivered from Egypt, and it was by the manna that they were sustained in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The tabernacle erected in the wilderness typifies the movable church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of church life is not solid or well established.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the children of Israel had entered into the good land and had enjoyed the blessing promised to Abraham, they built the temple with stone, by the unsearchably rich supply of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The temple typifies the solid church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1 Corinthians we have the church typified by the tabernacle, but in Colossians and Ephesians, the church typified by the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Christ we enjoy in Colossians is not simply the lamb and the manna, but the good land, the lot, the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christian teachers speak about the passover, the manna, and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I doubt that any have seen that the good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This type of Christ can be fulfilled only by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christians may know the Spirit of God, but they may not know the Spirit, the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit as the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God as the fulfillment of the promise of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For us, the good land promised by God to Abraham is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, the Spirit is the blessing God promised to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>WALKING IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Galatians 5:16 Paul charges us to walk in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit should be our realm, the sphere, in which we walk.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, in Galatians 5:25 Paul says, If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in spirit Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>. This indicates that the Spirit is our good land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christ revealed in the New Testament, especially in Colossians, is the all-inclusive land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This land is Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah, we have received a share in such a portion!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE NEED FOR AN EXODUS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we see this, we shall not allow things other than Christ to invade the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Colossians were troubled by ordinances, practices, philosophy, and asceticism because they did not see that Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit was their portion, their good land.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In place of this portion, they accepted observances, ordinances, and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In principle, the same is true of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christianity has been invaded by culture.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not one part of Christianity has been exempt from this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All of Christianity has been flooded by culture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The purpose of the Lord s recovery is to bring us out of all this to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At first, the world was Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now the religion of Christianity has become an Egypt where God s people are held in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s people today need an exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many of us can testify that when we came into the church life, we made an exodus and were delivered out of the authority of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>ONLY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, they remembered the flavor of the leeks, onions, and garlic they enjoyed in Egypt, and they still longed to eat that kind of food.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when the children of Israel entered into the good land, nothing with an Egyptian flavor was brought into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That would have been blasphemous to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To bring into the church something other than Christ is also a blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the good land there are no Egyptian leeks, onions, and garlic.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the good land we enjoy only the produce of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the same principle, there is no worldly garlic in the church life, only Christ as the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we see this, we shall be kept from bringing any foreign element into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have seen that the portion of the saints is Christ as the good land, the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Firstly, Christ is the seed that gives us life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then He becomes the kingdom, the realm, the sphere, in which we live and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, Christ is our seed and our land, our life and our realm.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is Christ as the portion of the saints.</S>
