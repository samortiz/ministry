   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we want to receive the prize, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"But I buffet my body and make it my slave."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many would place their own bodies above the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many would place their own bodies above the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But Paul said that he subjected his body; he was able to control it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul could control the lust of his body, the excessive demands of his body, and the desires of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not let his body get on top.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He said that he buffeted his body and made it his slave.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether or not a Christian can please the Lord depends upon whether he can control his body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people cannot control their own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever a little stimulus comes to their body, all kinds of sins result.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must see that all those who cannot control their own bodies will lose their prize and their crown.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although they can preach the gospel to others, they themselves will be disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We believers are saved once and for all and will never lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when the Lord Jesus returns in His glory to rule the earth, He will not give crowns to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the new heaven and new earth, although every saved one will receive the same glory, when the Lord Jesus comes to rule on this earth for a thousand years, some will lose their prize, their authority, and their glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some will not be able to enter the kingdom and will not be able to receive a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord's word is very clear concerning the matters of salvation and eternal life: both are totally of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, whether or not one can enter into the kingdom of the heavens depends upon his works.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have just seen that we have to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we see that we have to buffet our own body.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Bible there seems to be a fixed number of crowns.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation 3:11 says, "I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some who do not understand the Bible do not know the difference between a reward and a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Neither do they know the difference between the crown and God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They think that salvation can be taken away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "take" here does not refer to salvation but to the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One can be saved yet still lose the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There was a very sensational headline in the news recently.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A certain king of a certain country had lost his crown.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a saved one does not hold fast to what he has, if he does not keep the words of endurance of the Lord Jesus, and if he forsakes the name of the Lord Jesus, he will lose his crown some day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are loose, and if you do not hold fast, you will lose your crown.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Someone else might take away your crown from you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation 2:10 has a word similar to this: "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here it does not say give life, but give the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Life is obtained through faith; it is not obtained through faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a person does not have faith, he cannot have life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if a person is unfaithful after he has life, he will lose the crown of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, if a Christian does not have good works after being saved, though he will not lose life, he will nevertheless lose the crown.</S>
