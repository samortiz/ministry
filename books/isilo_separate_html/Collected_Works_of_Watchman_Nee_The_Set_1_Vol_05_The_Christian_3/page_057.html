Yet we have to realize that "the people" here refers to the people in the church. From its name, we see that Laodicea is a church of people's ruling. Here we see the believers rising up for independence and self-rule. They oppose the authority of their spiritual leaders. They consider the church to be the church of the members and that everything should be according to the common will of the members. In this way, the ancient church has followed the most modern trend. They choose their pastors like they choose their lawyers and doctors. They think that since they contribute the money, they should therefore make the choice. They should receive according to their contribution of money. Although they may not admit that they have itching ears, it is nevertheless a fact that they "heap up to themselves teachers" (2 Tim. 4:3). In any case, the ear is always their counselor. This is inevitable because it is always the speakings, whether soothing or offensive to the ear, that decide the employment or unemployment of a person.</P><P>Even when they are pastors, they are standing only on the ground of hired workers. In the Presbyterian Church, there are the elected elders as the decision makers of the church. This is a democratic institution. In the Episcopal Churches there are also the elected directors who oversee all the affairs of the church. The pastor is only a moral counselor. In the Congregational Churches this is even more truly the case. The Congregational Church has the members as the basic unit. Its very name implies this. The present day churches are truly democratic churches. The minority has to submit to the majority. The solution to all problems is to win enough votes and to gain enough hands. Anything that is agreed upon by all, whatever this thing may be, can be executed. Anything that is vetoed, whatever it may be, has to be stopped. The quantity is emphasized, and the quality is neglected. The most pitiful thing is that the condition of the church, even at its best, is such that the spiritual ones are always in the minority. Under such a circumstance, how can one hope to see a flourishing situation? Many churches are in fact worse than this. Is this not a pitiful condition? Of course there is always the possibility for the few spiritual ones to affect the whole. At a time when public right is highly developed, however, the spiritual ones in the church have become to many the most useless ones. It is possible to ask them to pray, but one cannot ask them to be in charge of anything.</P><P>The system of Roman Catholicism is, of course, most autocratic. Everyone from the Pope at the top to the priests are all authoritative. The common believers do not have the right even to come to God directly. These are the middle-men between God and men. They go to God for the common believers and go to the common believers in the authority of God. This, of course, was overturned by the Reformation. Now the Bible is open, and man is to listen to the Bible and not to the priests or the Pope. At the beginning of Christianity the Bible was propagated through hand-written copies which were few in number. Not many people received a copy of it. After the Reformation God brought in the invention of the printing press at the right time, and the Bible became the most common book. There is now the possibility for everyone to have a copy of the Holy Book. The believers can still be ignorant of the Bible. Yet if they are ignorant now, it is because they have chosen to be so instead of being forced to be so. Having the Bible is, of course, the greatest blessing. But then, the responsibility that comes with it is also very great.</P><P>Although the Bible has been released, and Protestantism has upheld the liberty of the believers, the overwhelming number of fleshly ones and their reluctance to bear responsibility before the Lord causes the so-called "clergy-laity system" to come into being in Protestantism. It becomes a different form of the Roman priesthood. The believers are willing to blindly follow their blind leaders. We have said much about this before and will not repeat it here again.</P><P>Sardis is the product of the reformation of Thyatira, and Philadelphia is the product of the reformation of Sardis. Protestantism initiated a reformation from Roman Catholicism, and Philadelphia initiated a reformation from Protestantism. Outwardly Protestantism and Roman Catholicism are very different. Actually they are more or less the same; both are dead. Protestantism only took the authority away from the Roman Pope and gave it to another group of people. The authority was never returned to Christ. The authority that was in the hand of the Pope has now been transferred into the hands of the kings (for the state churches) and the hands of the many founders of denominations (for the many independent denominations). Man's creeds, ordinances, and constitutions have replaced what was once the will of the Pope. The Bible is supposedly released, yet man's theology, tradition, and creeds have still silenced it and shut it up. Of course, Protestantism will never admit to this fact, but the fact is there. How can one deny it? If Sardis had indeed reached the proper standard, we would not have seen Philadelphia being raised up in Revelation. It is because Sardis has taken the authority for church administration from the hand of one group of church officers and given it to another group of church officers that the Holy Spirit raises up Philadelphia. Who can doubt that Philadelphia is the result of the work of the Holy Spirit? Philadelphia typifies a total submission to Christ and a recognition that the Lord's word and His name have the highest authority and that they should be honored by the believers.</P><P>If we are thoughtless and if we do not have much experience or any spiritual discernment, we will not understand why Laodicea, the church of the human opinion, would come about after the great revival of Philadelphia and how it could have come about in the midst of Philadelphia. Yet this is actually the most natural and sure result. Philadelphia came out of Sardis, and Laodicea came out of Philadelphia. Philadelphia is one step more advanced than Sardis, but when Philadelphia regresses, it does not become Sardis again nor return to the position at Sardis. Instead, it becomes something new-Laodicea!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> </body></html>
