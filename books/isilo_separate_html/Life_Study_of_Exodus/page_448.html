The burnt offering is different from the sin offering. The sin offering may be considered a sacrifice, but the burnt offering may be considered a gift. The sin offering is for redemption; the burnt offering is for fellowship. The peace offering is for enjoyment and satisfaction. On the one hand, we have been identified with the crucified Christ as our sin offering. On the other hand, we are also identified with the resurrected Christ. The bull in Exodus 29 typifies the crucified Christ; the two rams signify the resurrected Christ. The resurrected Christ is offered to God first as a burnt offering and then as a peace offering. As those who are being sanctified to serve God as priests, not only do we have Christ as the sin offering, but we also have Him as the burnt offering and the peace offering. He is the bull in crucifixion, and He is also the rams in resurrection.</p><p>The offerings for the sanctification of the priests are of two main categories. The first category is that of the animal life; the second category is that of the vegetable life. Regarding the animal life, there are the bull and the two rams. Regarding the vegetable life, there are the bread, the cake, and the wafer. In each category there are three items. Figuratively speaking, this number three signifies resurrection. Even when Christ was on the cross, He offered Himself in resurrection.</p><p>Christ is both the crucified One and the resurrected One. As such a crucified and resurrected One, He not only represents us, but also includes us. We are included in Him. Hence, when He was crucified, we were crucified in Him. When He was resurrected and presented to God, we were in Him.</p><p>The resurrected Christ is a burnt offering. The burnt offering is offered to God for His full satisfaction. The entire burnt offering was burned on the altar as a sweet savor to God. This is difficult to explain. From experience we know that when we are identified with Christ in His death, we have the realization that we have become a heap of ashes. Then, spontaneously, we are in resurrection. Here in resurrection Christ, our portion, is a ram offered to God as our burnt offering to satisfy God in full. Therefore, in order to be priests, we need to be washed, clothed, and redeemed. Furthermore, we need Christ as the resurrected One to offer to God for His satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PEACE OFFERING</h2><p>The last step in the sanctifying of the priests is the offering of the second ram, the ram for a peace offering. The first step is to be washed; the second is to be clothed; the third is to present the bull as the sin offering; the fourth is to present the first ram as the burnt offering; and the fifth, the last, is to present the second ram as a peace offering.</p><p>The last part of 29:9 says, &ldquo;You shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.&rdquo; Literally, the Hebrew rendered consecrate means &ldquo;fill their hands.&rdquo; This is also the meaning in verses 29, 33, and 35. Therefore, to sanctify God&rsquo;s redeemed ones to be His priests requires the filling of their hands.</p><p>Many versions do not translate literally the Hebrew word which means to fill their hands. Some translations say consecrate; others even use the word ordain. Actually, what we have here is neither consecration nor ordination; it is the filling of the hands of the sanctified ones. Thus far, Aaron and his sons have been washed, clothed, and redeemed. These are the first three aspects of sanctification. They have also presented Christ as the burnt offering for God&rsquo;s full satisfaction. Therefore, their uncleanness has been taken away, their nakedness has been covered, their sinful nature has been dealt with, and they have offered Christ to God for His satisfaction. However, their hands are still empty. Even after all these four steps, they are still empty-handed. How can they serve God as priests if they are still empty-handed? In order to be priests serving God in a practical way, they need to have their hands filled.</p><p>We have seen that the washing, the clothing, and the presenting of the bull as the sin offering have solved three problems. The washing solves the problem of uncleanness, the clothing solves the problem of nakedness, and the presenting of the sin offering solves the problem of our sinful nature. Furthermore, we have seen that the presenting of the burnt offering satisfies God and causes Him to be happy. When God smells the aroma of the burnt offering, He can say, &ldquo;I am satisfied and happy.&rdquo; However, the priests, who are still empty-handed, might say, &ldquo;O God, You are happy, but we are still hungry. Lord, we have nothing to fill our hands or our stomach. Yes, we have been cleansed and covered. Our sin has been taken away, and You are satisfied. But, Lord, we are still hungry.&rdquo; Because of this hunger, there is the need for the last step in the sanctification of the priests&mdash;the offering of the second ram.</p><p>Hallelujah for Christ as the second ram! This ram is not the sin offering to solve the problem of sin; neither is it the burnt offering to satisfy God. This ram is for the peace offering. The peace offering enables the priests to enjoy Christ with God. In other words, to have the peace offering is to be prepared to feast with God. The peace offering is for our feasting with God. In the following message we shall consider this offering in more detail.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_447.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_449.html">Next</a> </body></html>
