   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE WAY TO EAT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 24, 30; 12:13, 3b; Acts 9:14; Rom 10:12; Isa 55:1-2, 6, 10-11; Lam 3:55-57 I. CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO ENJOY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 1:2 tells us that the called saints are those who call upon the name of the Lord, and those who call upon the name of the Lord are the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The totality of these saints is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, our status and our position are that we are saints, those who call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said that Christ is theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that Christ is the portion of all those who call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in verse 9 he said that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ, that is, into the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has called us that we may participate in the enjoyment of Christ, and the way to enjoy Christ is by calling upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Again I say that in reading the Bible our problem is that we often read our own concepts into the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, it is very difficult for us to receive any revelations from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, normally we have some understanding of love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, when we read 1 Corinthians 13, it is easy for us to grasp what it says about love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Love is this or love is that.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when we read 1 Corinthians 1, it is difficult for us to see that we are the called saints and that we are those who should call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are called to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is also difficult for us to see that Christ is theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, it is difficult for us to see that God has called us not that we may go to heaven but that we may enter into the fellowship of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has called us into the fellowship of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is equivalent to God s inviting us to a feast to enjoy His Son, as referred to in Matthew 22.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This Christ is God s wisdom and God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has made this Christ to be our righteousness for the past, our sanctification for the present, and our redemption for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past we were full of unrighteousness, and we were a mess, but Christ is our righteousness to deal with our past.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through His death on the cross He satisfied God s righteous requirement and solved the problems of our past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As to the present we are very weak and have many failures, but Christ is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in the future He will transfigure our body that we may be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, He entered into our spirit, He is transforming our soul, and He will transfigure our body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He takes care of all three parts of our being: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a Christ is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has called us that we may enjoy such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BEING BAPTIZED INTO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>TO DRINK OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Up to this point what we have covered is merely doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is as if I told you that we have a feast here which is truly rich and very good, but you have not as yet tasted a bit of it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, in 1 Corinthians, after the objective truths are presented in chapters one and two, chapter twelve tells us how to experience such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, it tells us that all the believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, were baptized into one Spirit v. 13 . The rich Christ today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Like electricity, the Spirit is hard to describe; thus, God uses water to signify the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we were baptized, we were put into the water; this signifies that we were put into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the Spirit; when we were baptized into Christ, we were baptized into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we were baptized into the Spirit, we obtained the position to drink this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse in the original language means that we were put in the position for us to drink this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How do we drink this Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 3 of the same chapter says, No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, once you say, Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>, immediately you are in the Holy Spirit, and you are drinking the Spirit.</S>
