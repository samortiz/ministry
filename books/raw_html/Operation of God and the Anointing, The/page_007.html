        <h2 class="head2">The Way God Operates in Us</h2>
<p>God has entered into us, and He dwells in us, but how does He operate in us? A brother may argue with his wife in the morning. While he is arguing with her, does he have any feeling within? The more he argues, the more he wants to argue. If the wife raises her voice slightly, the brother will raise his voice even higher. Some couples can argue from eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning until eight o&rsquo;clock at night. However, a genuine Christian will have a feeling within if he argues with his wife. If he does not have any feeling, I doubt that he is saved or is a genuine Christian. If he is a genuine Christian, as soon as he raises his voice, he will have a feeling within. He will have a sense that God is not pleased with him.</p>
<p>Not only so, when he prays after the argument, he will sense that there is a problem and that he should not have argued. Even the next day he will still sense that there is a problem; there will be an inexplicable feeling within him. This feeling can be compared to having indigestion after a meal. He wants to pray, but he cannot pray. He may want to fellowship with a brother, but he does not have anything to say. He does not want to miss a meeting, but he cannot sit still when he is in the meeting, nor can he receive the message. He feels miserable within because he knows that he should reconcile with his wife, but he cannot bring himself to do it. Hence, he is unable to pray or read the Bible. This feeling of discomfort is not related to being angry with his wife. This is the feeling of a genuine Christian. Such feelings are God&rsquo;s operation within us. When God cannot get through in us, we will feel as if we have &ldquo;indigestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This feeling of struggle proves that we have the divine life and that we also have a problem within. If we did not have any feeling, it would indicate that we do not have the divine life, that we are dead. A person who is not saved may not be bothered when he argues with his wife, even if the argument continues for a whole day. He may stomp his feet in anger but not feel condemned. However, a person who is saved is alive within. Hence, as soon as he begins to argue with his wife, God will operate within him, causing him to feel bothered. If he does not allow God to operate, there will be a barrier between him and God, and he will feel uncomfortable and bothered.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Responding to God&rsquo;s Operation</h2>
<p>A proper Christian responds to God&rsquo;s operation. When he is about to argue with his wife and senses God&rsquo;s operation, he should obey and stop the argument. There is a brother who was about to argue with his wife, but he had a sense not to argue with her. He immediately stopped, went into the bedroom, shut the door, and prayed. Although he had tears, he felt joy within and began to praise God. Later, when his wife was angry and careless with her words, he was not provoked. At such a time he was not merely human; he was one with God. He let God reign within him so that even when his wife yelled at him and scolded him, he was able to rejoice and praise God. This brother expressed the God who filled him.</p>
<p>If this brother learns this lesson well, he will begin to check with God before he does something. Every time he considers a matter, he will ask, &ldquo;Lord, what do You think about this?&rdquo; He will also ask the Lord concerning his decisions. This shows that he has learned the lesson not to take his own thoughts, views, ways, or decisions. Instead, he will put himself aside and let God have the ground in him. Then God&rsquo;s thoughts, views, ways, and decisions will become his. As a result, his thoughts will be God&rsquo;s thoughts, his views will be God&rsquo;s views, his actions will be God&rsquo;s actions, and his decisions will be God&rsquo;s decisions. His speech, attitude, behavior, and actions will be out of God and will express God. Such a brother has &ldquo;digested&rdquo; God. Hence, his thoughts, emotions, preferences, opinions, and decisions are filled with God. God is not only in him; God is operating in him and being expressed through him.</p>
<p>If we want to gain God, we must let Him operate in us. To gain God does not depend on how zealous we are for Him, nor does it depend on how many things we have done for Him. To gain God depends on our letting Him operate in us and on our being willing to respond to His operation within us. We often are willing to be zealous for God, but we are not willing to respond to God&rsquo;s operation in us. We often are willing to do a great work for Him, but we are not willing to respond to His operation within us by confessing our mistakes. Our zeal and our work are often filled with our own element: our preferences, our interests, our opinions, and our inclinations. We are willing to be zealous for God, but we are not willing to let Him deal with our preferences and interests. We are willing to work for Him, but we are not willing to let Him deal with our opinions and inclinations. Our preferences and opinions in our zeal and work usurp not only the ground that God should have but also His rule in us; hence, He cannot get through in us. We follow our preferences and opinions instead of responding to His operation in us. Our preferences and opinions are our self. Hence, it is the self who rules and reigns in our zeal and our work. We are not willing to put aside the self and let God have the ground in us so that He can be expressed. Only when we are willing to drop everything else and care for God&rsquo;s operation in us, can we gain Him and be filled with Him. When we are willing to live, act, and work according to His operation, He will gain more ground in us, spread in us, and be expressed through us.</p>
<p>If we are willing to put ourselves aside and let God spread and operate freely in us, we will be filled with the riches of God unto the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19b). This is the way to gain God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
