<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WAY TO SPEAK FOR GOD IN VARIOUS KINDS OF MEETINGS</h1><p>To say that the purpose of the Christian meeting is for speaking is altogether against traditional Christianity. According to traditional Christianity, the Christian meeting is called tso-li-pai in Chinese, which literally means “doing a worship.” Such an expression, which was probably coined by the Western missionaries who did not know Chinese adequately, is puzzling to the Chinese people. The Chinese have expressions such as tso-fan (prepare a meal), tso-i-fu (make a dress), tso-chia-shih (do housework), tso-kung-k’e (do homework), tso-hsueh-wen (learn knowledge), tso-cho-tzu (make a table), and tso-i-tzu (make a chair). All these expressions are understandable. However, to say tso-li-pai—“doing a worship” or “making a worship”—is difficult to understand.<p>From the Bible we see that the way Christians meet is a matter of immense importance. Unfortunately, due to the degradation of the church, Christians have gradually deviated from taking the proper way in many important matters, and the most important of them all is the matter of meeting. Therefore, we want to investigate the history of Christian, or church, meetings.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH LIFE STARTED BY THE FIRST GROUP OF CHRISTIANS</h2><p>The last part of Acts chapter two shows us that on the day of Pentecost three thousand were saved and baptized into the name of the Lord (v. 41), and then these ones immediately began to meet together. The way they met was clearly recorded in the second chapter of Acts. Acts 2:46 says, “And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart.” The Greek words translated from house to house mean “in every home.” Those who know a little Greek know that this expression from house to house is quite fitting. It indicates that the early believers met together not only in the temple but also in their homes, from house to house.<p>In chapter five, the last verse says, “And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ” (v. 42). The early believers did two things. The first thing they did was teach people. We believe that what they taught was surely based on the truths they heard from Peter and John, and they taught from house to house. The second thing they did was announce the gospel of Jesus as the Christ. These were the two things they did. On the one hand, they taught the truths, and on the other hand, they announced the gospel; furthermore, they did these things from house to house.<p>This verse also shows us that at Pentecost, when the Christians began to meet, their meetings were of two kinds. On the one hand, they had meetings in the temple; these were big meetings. On the other hand, they had meetings in the homes, from house to house; these were small meetings. However, we must realize one thing. The actions of the believers on the day of Pentecost were altogether the actions of the Holy Spirit who was poured out upon them. On the day of Pentecost, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit was particularly intense, and the atmosphere of the presence of the Holy Spirit was especially strong; that was a great move of the Holy Spirit. After hearing the gospel, many were pricked in their heart, and asked Peter, “What should we do?” Peter answered, “Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins” (2:37-38). Thus, they all repented and were baptized. After they were baptized, they began to have big meetings in the temple and also small meetings from house to house. From this we cannot help acknowledging that their actions were absolutely of the Holy Spirit and were the move of the Holy Spirit, because never in the history of the Jewish people had there been such a thing as meeting from house to house.<p>This way of meeting initiated by the first group of Christians for their church life on the day of Pentecost was a creation and a masterpiece of the Holy Spirit and was led and ordained by the Holy Spirit. This way of meeting created by the Holy Spirit was of two aspects. On the one hand, there were the big meetings in the temple, and on the other hand, there were the small meetings from house to house. If we read this portion of the Word in a thorough manner, we will see that this was proper. The big meetings were held in the temple so that people could be brought in order to gain them. In order to gain the Jewish people, the big meetings in the temple were necessary. This is similar to our practice today. We preach the gospel in the gospel meetings to lead people to salvation. After they have been baptized, we turn them over to the small meetings held from house to house. In these small meetings held from house to house, the newly saved ones can function comfortably, be preserved, and learn to take care of others.
