<h1 class="title">ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE MINGLED SPIRIT<br />
AND GOING OUT<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S INTERESTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; Gal. 5:16, 25; 6:18</h1>
<p>The revelation of the Bible is that Christ came in the flesh to be the Lamb of God (John 1:29) that He might die on the cross in order to accomplish redemption, deal with all negative things&mdash;including sin, Satan, the flesh, and the world&mdash;solve all problems, and release the divine life from within Him. Following this, He rested for three days, and then He resurrected from the dead. In resurrection Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). We must all be deeply impressed with the two steps that Christ took. First, as God He became flesh to accomplish redemption and release His life, and then as the last Adam He became the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life. Now sin is gone, and life, which is Christ Himself (John 11:25; 14:6), is here. Because God has forgiven us of our sins and Christ has imparted Himself into us as life, we have all become living members of Christ&rsquo;s Body, His living organism for His expression. Whenever and wherever we come together, we are the church, the Body of Christ as His expression.</p>
<p>Now Christ is no longer only objective to us but very subjective. Therefore, we all need to live by this living, subjective One and walk in our spirit, which is regenerated and indwelt by the Spirit of God. This spirit is the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22). We, the redeemed ones, do have a wonderful mingled spirit as the treasure in our being (2 Cor. 4:7). This mingled spirit is the source of every spiritual reality and spiritual attribute. Regardless of how young a person is, as long as he believes in the Lord Jesus, is washed by His redeeming blood, forgiven of all his sins, and regenerated in his spirit, he has this wonderful treasure within him. Regrettably, however, very few Christians are clear that as redeemed sinners and living members of Christ they have a wonderful spirit that is mingled with the divine Spirit. Some Christian teachers even oppose this truth. When we speak of our spirit mingled with the divine Spirit, some say that we are teaching &ldquo;evolution into God.&rdquo; This shortsightedness is an insult and even a blasphemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR HUMAN SPIRIT BEING<br />
BORN OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>That we have a mingled spirit is according to the revelation of the Bible. Some say, &ldquo;God is high, great, holy, and divine, but we are low, small, mean, and sinful. How can we sinful persons be mingled with God?&rdquo; This argument neglects the spiritual facts. The first fact is in John 3:6, which says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; This verse makes it clear that it is our spirit, not our mind or even our heart, that has been born of the divine Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The second fact, which is even stronger, is in 1 Corinthians 6:17, which says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; <em>One spirit</em> indicates a mingling. We are one spirit with the Lord because we have been joined to Him organically in our spirit. Our critics are shortsighted, even blinded, by their traditional concepts. They know that God is high and that we are low, but they do not see 1 Corinthians 6:17. The revelation of the mingled spirit is wonderful and great. Without being mingled, how can the human spirit and the divine Spirit become one? Many in Christianity say that the church is merely united with Christ. This is not wrong, since the Bible tells us that Christ is the Husband and the church is the wife (Eph. 5:25). However, while saying that our union with Christ is scriptural, some say that to be mingled with the Lord as one spirit is a heresy. These critics have been blinded by religion. They hold to Ephesians 5:25, but they do not see 1 Corinthians 6:17.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING IN US AND WE IN HIM</h2>
<p>The third spiritual fact is that the New Testament repeatedly says that we are in Christ and that He is in us (1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:17; John 14:20; 15:4-5; 17:23, 26; Rom. 8:10; Gal. 2:20). If we were only in Christ but He were not in us, or vice versa, there would simply be an indwelling, not a mingling. However, the Bible says again and again that we are in Him and that He is also in us. This is not a mere indwelling; it is a mingling. We may illustrate this mingling by considering a glass of tea. Not only is the tea in the water, but the water is also in the tea. This is a mingling of the tea with the water. We all need to see the mingling of God and man. Some critics say that if we as human beings are mingled with God, God and we will both lose our natures. This thought is short even of scientific knowledge. When tea is mingled with water, both the nature of the tea and the nature of the water remain unchanged. It is not that the water is no longer water and that the tea is no longer tea. Although the two are mingled as one, they both retain their distinctive natures. <em>Webster&rsquo;s Third New International Dictionary</em> defines <em>mingle</em> as &ldquo;to bring or combine together or with something else so that the components remain distinguishable in the combination.&rdquo; A clear Old Testament type of mingling is seen in the meal offering, which is composed of fine flour, signifying Christ&rsquo;s humanity, mingled with oil, signifying the Holy Spirit as Christ&rsquo;s divinity (Lev. 2:4). In such a mingling the distinction between the two elements of fine flour and oil is preserved, and no third element is produced. The same is true regarding the mingling of divinity and humanity in the incarnated Christ and in His believers. Although the proper denotation of <em>mingling</em> is readily understood, most Christians still neglect the truth concerning mingling, and some condemn it as heretical. This is because they are veiled and blinded by their traditional, religious doctrine. We are not arguing here for doctrine; we are contending for the truth.</p>
