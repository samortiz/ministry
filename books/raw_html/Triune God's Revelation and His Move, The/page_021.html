<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>ILLUSTRATIONS OF RECEIVING REVELATION FROM THE HOLY WORD AND SEEING VISION THROUGH REVELATION</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=title>THE GREATEST AND HIGHEST VISION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:1, 26-28; 2:7-25</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Covering the entire economy of God—Gen. 1—2.</li><li>God’s creation is for Him to be one with man.</li><li>In the first section of His creation God created man only in His image and after His likeness outwardly, without the life of God inwardly.</li><li>The second section of His creation begins with His making man a spirit and putting man in front of the tree of life.</li><li>Making a spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life indicate that God wanted man to receive Him as the tree of life to be man’s life and everything.</li><li>From the place of the tree of life, a river flowing and producing gold, bdellium, and onyx stone indicates that the flow of the life of God in the believers transforms them to be the three kinds of precious materials for the building of the Body of Christ as God’s eternal goal—1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-21.</li><li>None of the living creatures was qualified to be Adam’s counterpart, wife, indicating that no natural life is qualified to match Christ as His counterpart.</li><li>God caused Adam to sleep, opened his side, took one of his ribs out of him, and built it into a woman who was fully qualified to be his counterpart, indicating that God put Christ to death and from His pierced side flowed blood for redemption and water for dispensing of life to produce the church to match Christ as His counterpart.</li><li>The rib of Adam taken out of him signifies the unbreakable life of Christ (John 19:33, 36) which flows as the living water of life.</li><li>This greatest and highest vision unveils God’s new creation as the second section of His creation in resurrection, out of His old creation as the first section of His creation in nature. It equals the entire revelation of the entire Bible, from God’s creation (Gen. 1), through His incarnation to present Himself as the tree of life to all the fallen people for the producing of the church, through His death, resurrection, and transforming work for the building up of His organic Body to match Him as His counterpart, unto the consummation in the New Jerusalem as a couple of the redeeming God and the redeemed people for God’s enlarged expression for eternity with the divine glory manifested in humanity.</li><li>God’s moves in all the ages are motivated by all the contents of this greatest and highest vision.</li></ol><h2 class=head1>I. COVERING THE ENTIRE ECONOMY OF GOD</h2><p>It is very hard to receive revelation and even harder to see a vision from Genesis 1 and 2, the first two chapters of the Bible. But the Lord in His mercy has opened up this part of His Word to us for many years. The vision in these two chapters is the greatest and highest vision. No vision is greater or higher than this vision, which covers the entire economy of God.
