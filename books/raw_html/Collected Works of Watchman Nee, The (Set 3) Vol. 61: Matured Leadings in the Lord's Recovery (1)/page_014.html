<h2 class="head1">BEING ABLE TO PERFECT OTHERS</h2><p>In order to raise up the one-talented ones, instead of letting their talent remain hidden in the earth, there is the need of perfecting trainings and spiritual education. We need prayer meetings and Bible-study meetings that perfect men. In perfecting the saints, we should not select just the ones who are in high positions, who have money, who have worldly experience, or who are competent in the world. Instead, we should choose those who have spiritual perception, spiritual understanding, and who have made spiritual advancements. Moreover, they have to be consecrated. There is a brother in Shanghai who is not very capable, but he has spiritual perception, and his understanding is perfect. He is actually more qualified than many so-called experienced ones. The way to judge a man is to see if he is consecrated, if he has spiritual perception, and if his heart is perfect. Some are willing to consecrate in this way, but they are not very smart. Among those who meet these qualifications, we have to select a few. We have to work on them particularly. Sometimes we have to work on them together, and sometimes we have to work on them separately. They all must be able to do better than us. It does not matter if they do not do well in the beginning. After a few times they will improve. The fallen mentality thinks that only we ourselves can do a job, but we have to perfect others to do it and help them to do it. Perfect a few, and then charge them to help others to do the same. The four Gospels show us clearly that the Lord did not commit Himself to everyone; He only committed Himself to the twelve disciples. The twelve then committed themselves to the hundred and twenty, who committed themselves to three thousand. First John 1:3 says that the disciples have fellowship with the apostles who have fellowship with the Father and the Son. This is the principle. We have to learn from the example of the Lord Jesus and the apostles.</p><p>If there is an agricultural seminar, it is difficult to ask the president of the country to be the chairman. If there is a symposium of doctors, it is difficult to ask the governor of Hong Kong to be the chairman. Even if these dignitaries came, they could only sit in the last row. Likewise, it would be difficult for us to actively participate in a worldly convention. If we join them, we could only be passive spectators. However, in spiritual matters, we cannot deny that we have learned more things than some other brothers and sisters. They may be more capable and experienced than we are, but they have to sit in the back to listen to us. Paul charged Timothy to take the lead in Ephesus, and he reminded him to not let others despise his youth in particular, knowing from which ones he had learned (1 Tim. 4:12; 2 Tim. 3:14). We should never measure a man according to worldly standards.</p><p>In summary, we have to find men who are perfect in heart and who have spiritual understanding. Do not worry about their age; pay attention to their consecration and spiritual perception. If a man does not have spiritual perception, he is of little use in the work. We can perfect a few people one at a time, or we can gather them together and teach them as a group. Paul not only edified the church; he also raised up a few individuals. He wrote to the church in Corinth, but he also wrote to individuals such as Timothy and Titus. He not only traveled among the churches to teach God's kingdom, but he picked out Titus, Timothy, Philemon, and Onesimus, and he perfected them one by one.</p><p>We can gather brothers and sisters in the countryside to Canton and Hong Kong and train them in the fifty-two lessons for new believers. We can do this in two trainings, with each training being two weeks in length. After they are trained, they can be sent back to the countryside to work.</p><p>The principle in God's work is to involve ourselves in the work first and then involve others in the same work. If we do not take care of these two steps, we have failed and have come short of God's standard. We cannot say that we have done enough as long as we have worked hard ourselves. We cannot say this. Paul not only worked himself, but he stirred up others to join him in the work. In his Epistles to the Corinthians, we can see that he was pushing others to do the same work. We have to arrange some work for other brothers and sisters to do. We cannot be the only ones who are busy all the time. This approach is ineffective. In a hundred years everyone sitting here will be gone. If no one is perfected to continue our work, what a loss this will be to God! We have to use every means to make others work. We have to learn to take them by the hand in our work. We have to learn to deal with them and gain them. The way is to work, visit, and preach the gospel together with them. We admit that we are all inexperienced in this area. We have to be in fear and trembling, and we have to be very exercised before the Lord.</p><p>No one can be careless or loose in perfecting others. We should not think that we know everything. We should not think that we can be a teacher by simply reading textbooks. There was no school for training prophets; all the prophets were raised up by God individually. We can only say that we do not know that much. We are here learning, and we are hoping to bring men to God so that God can have a way in them. We have to be in fear and trembling. We should not order others to do this or that lightly. Instead, we should take the lead to work together with others. It is very presumptuous to think that only we can do something and that no one else can do it. The people that the Lord has given to us are more than what we need. Every one of them is useful. We should not be presumptuous, loose, or careless. However, we should not hesitate to make decisions for fear of making mistakes.</p><p>We have covered the matter of leadership before. Leadership does not depend on ability. Rather, it depends on: 1) much prayer and diligent study of the Word, 2) the capacity to perfect others and raise them up, and 3) making everyone useful. The way ahead lies on our shoulders. If we are faithful to the Lord, He will get through in us, and the brothers and sisters will have a way to follow us.</p><h2 class="head1">HELPING ALL THE ONE-TALENTED ONES TO SERVE</h2><p>Can we help all the brothers and sisters rise up to serve? If we can, we will not have any problems. Even if we have more people, we can still handle them. Who can withstand the church when the entire Body rises up to serve? Five can chase a hundred, and a hundred can chase ten thousand (Lev. 26:8). If we can raise up all the one-talented ones, we can absorb as many people as are given to us.</p><p>Those who are hard and stiff are hard inwardly; outwardly they can be very soft. This is the reason it is not easy to perfect a person. When a person volunteers to serve, he carries with him both his outward and inward attributes. Those who are gifted are usually hard and stiff. We cannot open the door just to outward attributes while ignoring inward attributes. If we do, we will make it hard for others to go on. It takes much work, labor, and prayer to perfect one person.</p><p>Brother Weigh's personal problems cannot be dealt with quickly. I would consider it very quick indeed if they are dealt with after five years. It may take eight or ten years for some people. Time is a big factor. We should not think that hearing something and understanding it is the end of the story. We have to ask the Lord for much mercy.</p>
