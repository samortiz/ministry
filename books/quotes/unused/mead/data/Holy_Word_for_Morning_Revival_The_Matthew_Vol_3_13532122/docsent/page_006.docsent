   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 11 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 15:1-6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3 And He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>4 For God said, " 1 Honor your father and your mother," and, "He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>5 But you say, Whoever says to his father or his mother, Whatever you would have been profited by me is now a gift to God,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>6 Shall by no means honor his father or his mother; and you have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the Lord forsook the rejecting religionists, they still would not cease troubling Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They came to Him from their religious center, Jerusalem, in order to find fault with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, their troubling afforded Him another opportunity to reveal the truth concerning genuine cleanness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>10-11, 15-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Pharisees and scribes asked the Lord Jesus why His disciples transgressed the tradition of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This reveals that the disciples did not keep the old traditions in following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They cared only for the heavenly King's presence, not for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past, some of those who claimed to be for God had certain practices, and their practices eventually became the traditions that were observed by the Jews when the Lord Jesus was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, these traditions were not commandments in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing commanded by God could ever become a tradition, for God's word is always fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A tradition, on the contrary, is something invented or initiated by man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Jewish religionists accused the Lord's disciples of transgressing their tradition, but the Lord condemned the religionists for transgressing the commandment of God because of their tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They cared for their tradition, but they ignored God's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In principle, the religious people today do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Roman Catholic Church and most Protestant denominations make void the word of God because of their traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Christendom many still insist on the traditions, and in the so-called churches these traditions are very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the Lord has raised us up to come back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not care for man's tradition, teaching, or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus and His followers were accused by the traditionalists, and today we are accused by the religionists.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>531-534</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>4 1 The Lord's dealing here with the Pharisees and scribes not only condemned them for making void the word of God because of their tradition but also implied that man should honor his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God in His government among men has ordained that man should honor his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has made this the first commandment among the ten commandments that concerns human relationships Exo 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fallen human nature, however, always prompts man to ignore his parents, that is, to rebel against God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to bring man back to God's government, the Lord as the heavenly King emphasized that man should honor his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This corresponds with His word in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens concerning the fulfillment of the law 5:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the apostle also emphasized this matter strongly Eph 6:1-3; Col 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We, the kingdom people, must honor our parents and not excuse ourselves as the Jewish religionists did.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To make any excuse indicates that we are not under the heavenly ruling but are following our fallen nature and the rebellious trend of today's generation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
