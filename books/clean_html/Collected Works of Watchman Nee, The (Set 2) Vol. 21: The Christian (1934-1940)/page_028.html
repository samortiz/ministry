<P>God wants us to do two things. First, He shows us that we are ill. The worst thing that can happen to a patient is to avoid the doctor. But unless a sick person admits that he is sick, he will not consult a doctor. Second, we have to go see the doctor. This is also very important. Suppose I have a friend who has tuberculosis but does not admit it. He argues that he is tall and strong and big, and that he is not sick. I would advise him, saying, "You have a slight fever every day, and your health is not good. You should rest more and work less. Otherwise, it would be hard to recuperate and be healed if your illness progresses to the second stage." But this friend of mine does not admit that he is sick. He argues: "Am I not well? Do I not have the strength to work?" He still goes to bed late and rises up early, and lives as he pleases. It does not mean that he is well; he is merely denying his own illness. As such he can never be healed. This is the way God treats the world. It does not mean that God does not have the way, the means, or the salvation ready. The trouble is that man does not realize that he is sick and that he is a sinner. This is why it takes God two stages to enlighten man. John 1 says that the law was first given by Moses, and then grace and reality came through Jesus Christ (v. 17). God took four thousand years to show man that he is sick. God gave the law to man in order that he would see that he is a sinner, and that all men are sinners. God did not give the law for man to keep, but for man to realize that he is a sinner. The purpose of the law is for man to know himself. The law cannot justify man, nor can it save man. The book of Romans makes this point very clear. It says that "through the law is the clear knowledge of sin" (3:20). After we have the clear knowledge of sin, the Lord Jesus comes and says, "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</P><P>In the first stage, God gave the law. In the second stage, God gave us the Lord Jesusâ€”grace came. When a doctor diagnoses a patient, the first thing he does is to ask the patient to stick out his tongue, feel the patient's pulse, and measure his temperature. He will show the patient that he is sick and then tell him the kind of sickness that he has. Then he gives the patient a packet or a bottle of medicine. First, the doctor shows the patient that he is sick, and then he tells the patient the way and method to be healed. Therefore, the work in the second stage must be related to the work in the first stage. First, God gave the law so that man would realize that he is a sinner. Second, God sent grace, which is the Lord Jesus, so that man would be healed. But there are some stiff-necked ones who say that they are not sick, and that they do not have any sin. So the Lord Jesus said that He had not come to call the righteous (those who consider themselves righteous). Let the others keep the law and be Pharisees. Now that the Lord Jesus has come, He is telling us that a man must receive help in the first stage and then receive help in the second stage. Yet some men are not willing to receive the testimony of the law. If a man refuses to receive help from the law, he will not receive help from grace and reality. If a man does not receive help in the first instance, he will not receive help in the second. I may think that I am healthy, and I may stand tall. But after the doctor measures my pulse and temperature and examines me, he will tell me that I am sick. I may think that I am a good man, but now that the law has come, it tells me that I am a sinner. I may think that I am a wonderful man, but once the law comes, it will tell me that I am a sinner. This leaves me helpless. But the second man comes; He helps me and saves me. The law can only define a sick man. The commission of the law is to show man that he is sick. If you do not admit that you are sick, you must submit to the law.</P><P>A healthy person does not need a doctor; only a sick person needs a doctor. This is a great and universal principle. Friends, are you sick at heart? Do you have any hidden illness? Do you have any secret sins that no one can touch? Do you have sins that you have committed in darkness? Do you have some illness that cannot be told to others? God will touch your secret and hidden illnesses. It is a pity that, although man knows very well that he is naked and laid bare in God's eyes, and that he has a part in all kinds of unclean evils and human sins, he still tries to hide himself and mend himself. He still tries to improve his conduct a little before believing in Jesus. It seems as if he is trying to recuperate a little before going to the doctor. This is foolish. If you do not admit honestly that you are a sinner, you cannot be healed.</P><P>I like the song we sang today. It says, "Just as I am...I come! I come!" [Hymns, #1048]. I have told you before that this hymn was written by a woman in her twenties. She said that she had the sense of sin since she was very young. She wondered how a person like herself could face God. To her this was impossible. She visited many churches and talked with many pastors. She asked them questions and tried to find out from them how she could be saved. This went on for seven or eight years. Many told her that she had to do better before she could believe in Jesus. Others told her that she should pray more and study the Bible more. Still others told her to do good and perform noble deeds, or to do this or do that before she could believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved. As time went by, she found herself worse than before. In the end, she met an old preacher. She asked the old man what she must do before she could be saved. The old man put his hand on her back and said, "Go to God just as you are." She jumped up and asked, "Do I not have to do better, make more progress, and improve more before I can believe in the Lord Jesus?" The old man said, "There is no such need. You can come just as you are." On that day, she became clear and realized that she could come to the Lord just as she was.</P><P>God knows that we are sick. This is why He sent us the Doctor. Friends, have you ever been sick? Suppose I have a fever of one hundred five degrees. If I ask the doctor to come, will he say that he will come when the temperature drops to one hundred three? The sicker I am, the faster the doctor will come. If a person's temperature is ninety-eight degrees, the doctor may say that since it is only ninety-eight degrees, there is no need to go. The more serious your illness is, the faster the doctor will come. The woman admitted that she was a sick person and that Jesus Christ is the Physician from God who came to heal her. Not long after she returned home, she wrote this hymn: "Just as I am...I come! I come!"</P><P>Friends, what is grace? Grace is to come just as we are. There is no need to change or reform ourselves. We come just as we are. Many people think that a preacher is one who exhorts others to do good. But I never do this. If I exhort others to do good, I am merely putting powder and cosmetics on their faces and then sending them to hell. The Shanghai mortuary does a good job of grooming and touching up dead people and putting them into coffins. If I am a preacher exhorting men to do good, I am doing nothing except telling them to improve themselves and then go to hell. But hell does not need any improved or reformed persons. The Lord Jesus did not come to first make men better and then save them. He came to redeem us. He died and shed His blood for our sins. He died on the cross to accomplish redemption. He resurrected in order that we may not only be redeemed and forgiven, but receive the life of God, be saved, and have eternal life.</P>
