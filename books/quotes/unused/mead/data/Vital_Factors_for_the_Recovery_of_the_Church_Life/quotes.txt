[1]  Vital Factors for the Recovery of the Church Life CONTENTS
[2]  The Factor of the Spirit and the Factor of the Divine Life 1
[3]  The New Testament reveals to us that God has an eternal purpose.
[4]  God s eternal purpose is to have the church for the expression of Himself in Christ Eph 3:10-11 .
[5]  Ephesians 5:25 tells us that the Lord Jesus died for the church, and Matthew 16:18 tells us that He is now building the church.
[6]  If we are going to fulfill the desire of God s heart, surely we must practice the church life; and for us to practice the church life, we all need to see Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.
[7]  This very God became incarnated in the flesh John 1:1, 14 .
[8]  One day He entered into the womb of a virgin named Mary, and He accomplished a wonderful conception in that human womb.
[9]  One day Jesus was born of a human virgin to be a God-man.
[10]  After His birth, He lived on this earth for thirty years in a carpenter s home.
[11]  How mysterious it is that God became a man and lived as a man in a poor home for thirty years.
[12]  In Matthew 26 when He was judged by the Sanhedrin, the highest council of the Jews, the high priest said to Him, I adjure you by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God v. 63 . The Lord Jesus did not deny that He was the Son of God.
[13]  The first qualification is that Jesus died as the Lamb of God.
[14]  John 1:29 says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
[15]  Jesus died as the Lamb of God to take away the aggregate, the totality, of sin and sins.
[16]  In dying in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He was made sin for the believers 2 Cor 5:21 , and God condemned sin in the flesh through His death Rom 8:3 .
[17]  After He died and was buried, on the third day He rose from the dead 1 Cor 15:3-4 .
[18]  In His resurrection He accomplished two main things: first, He imparted the divine life into His believers for their regeneration John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3 , and, second, He became a life-giving Spirit to impart the Triune God essentially into His believers as their life and life supply 1 Cor 15:45b .
[19]  After He completed everything through His death, in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to enter into His disciples to bring the processed Triune God into them as their life and life supply.
[20]  Today the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwells us to impart the processed Triune God into our being as our life and our life supply.
[21]  THE FACTOR OF THE DIVINE LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:2; John 1:29; Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 5:21; John 3:14; Heb 2:14; 1 Cor 15:45; Col 1:15; Eph 2:14-15; Gen 1:2; 2:7-8; Luke 1:35; 4:1; John 7:39; 2 Cor 3:17; John 20:22; Acts 2:33
[22]  The Spirit is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, and life is the divine life, the eternal, uncreated life of God 1 John 1:2; Eph 4:18 .
[23]  Christ died on the cross with a sevenfold qualification: He was the Lamb of God; He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin; He was in the form of a brass serpent; He was the last Adam, the last of mankind; He was the Firstborn, the first item, of all God s creatures; He was the Peacemaker; and He was a grain of wheat.
[24]  When Christ died as the Lamb of God, He died for us; that is, He died on our behalf.
[25]  In Christ s crucifixion, not only were all things terminated on the cross, but the divine life was released.
[26]  The divine life was released out of the one grain of wheat to produce many grains, the many sons of God.
[27]  We no longer belong to the old creation, but we are now sons of God and members of Christ.
[28]  Now, within us we have the essential Spirit, the Spirit s divine essence, and upon us we have the economical Spirit, the Spirit of God s economy.
[29]  The Spirit of Jehovah for God s Contact with Man
[30]  In this move, the Spirit is called the Spirit of Jehovah Gen 2:7-8; 6:3 .
[31]  Throughout the Old Testament, when God came to contact man, the Spirit of Jehovah came upon certain persons Judg.
[32]  The Spirit of God was there, the Spirit of Jehovah was there, and even the Holy Spirit was there, but the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[33]  The Spirit is the realization of Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God John 14:17-20; Col 2:9 .
[34]  The entire Triune God is embodied in Christ, and this Christ is fully realized as the Spirit.
[35]  After passing through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God in Christ became such a life-giving Spirit.
[36]  We praise You that we are here in the church enjoying You as the Spirit, as life, and as the very God.
[37]  After training His disciples for forty days, the Lord ascended to the heavens.
[38]  This Spirit today is also called the Spirit of God Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the Holy Spirit Acts 16:6 , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , and the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .
[39]  We have also seen that when the Triune God moves, He is the Spirit.
[40]  PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Eph 1:22-23; Acts 15:41; Rom 16:4; 2 Cor 8:1; Gal 1:2; Rev 1:4; Matt 18:17; 1 Cor 12:27; Eph 2:22; Rev 1:11; Titus 1:5; Acts 14:23; Phil 1:1; Rom 16:1; Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3; 1 Cor 10:16-17; 1 Tim 5:19-20; Matt 20:25-28; 23:8-12; 1 Pet 5:1-3; 1 Cor 1:12-13; Acts 13:1; 1 Cor 14:26, 29; Acts 14:4, 14; 21:8
[41]  In the previous chapters we have covered the first three factors that are vital to the recovery of the church life.
[42]  These factors are Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.
[43]  The universal church is the unique Body of Christ.
[44]  According to Ephesians 1:22-23, Christ is the Head and the church is His Body.
[45]  All the local churches constitute the one Body of Christ Eph 4:4 .
[46]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, I will build My church.
[47]  Here the church is in the singular number, indicating that it must be the universal church.
[48]  It is because the one church, the universal church, is the totality of all the churches, and all the churches are local constituents of the one universal church.
[49]  The ground of the church should not be merely local; it should also be universal.
[50]  Locally, the ground of the church is the ground of locality; universally, the ground of the church is the genuine oneness.
[51]  Although the administration of the church is separate and equal locally, the fellowship of the church is one universally.
[52]  In all the churches we should only teach one thing Jesus Christ as the Spirit to be our life for the producing of the church.
[53]  The elders should not lord it over the believers.
[54]  Instead, they should be patterns, examples, taking the lead to love the Lord, to seek after the truth, to grow in life, and to serve in the church Matt 20:25-28; 1 Pet 5:1-3 .
[55]  CHAPTER FIVE THE FACTOR OF THE SPIRIT S OPERATION THROUGH THE CROSS IN THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:6b, 17, 18; Gal 5:22-23; Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23-24; Col 3:10-11; Eph 2:22; 3:8; Gal 5:24; Rom 8:13; 6:6; Gal 2:20a; Matt 16:23, 24; 1 Cor 1:18-19; Eph 2:15,14; Heb 2:14; Gal 6:14
[56]  In this chapter we will see the most practical factor vital to the recovery of the church life.
[57]  This is the factor of the operation of the all-inclusive Spirit through the cross in the church life.
[58]  Therefore, God, Christ, the Spirit, the divine life, the believers, and the church are the crucial matters revealed in the Bible.
[59]  The All-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ Imparting Life
[60]  The Spirit who is operating in us is the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ, and He is operating in us in seven ways.
[61]  First, He is within us imparting His divine life to us 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:6b .
[62]  He imparts His divine life into our being in the same way that water flows through a garden hose.
[63]  However, the Holy Spirit does not work in us by Himself; He works through the cross.
[64]  In the church life, the Holy Spirit is the Surgeon who operates on us every day by means of the cross.
[65]  We must also experience the cross crucifying our old man and the self.
[66]  Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ.
[67]  In the previous chapters we have covered five factors vital to the recovery of the church life: Christ, the Spirit, the divine life, the proper practice of the church life, and the Spirit s operation through the cross.
[68]  Furthermore, in the church life we must not only have virtue, but transformed virtues Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23-24; 2 Cor 3:18 .
[69]  He was equal with God, but He did not regard His equality with God as a thing to be grasped Phil 2:6 .
[70]  In Ephesians 4:2 Paul said that, in addition to exercising the virtues of lowliness and meekness, we also need to be longsuffering.
