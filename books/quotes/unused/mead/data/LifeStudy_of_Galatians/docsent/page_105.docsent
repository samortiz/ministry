   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT TWO KINDS OF WALK BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 5:16, 22-23, 25; 6:15-16; 3:2-3, 5, 14; 4:6, 29; Rom 6:4; 8:4; 4:12; Phil 3:16-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall begin to consider the matter of two kinds of walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 5:16 Paul says, But I say, walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians 5:25 says, If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we shall see, in these two verses Paul uses two different Greek words for walk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>LIVING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For years I have tried to understand 5:25, where Paul speaks, on the one hand, of living by the Spirit and, on the other, of walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I did not know the difference between living and walking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It seemed to me that walking included living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually I came to see that to live by the Spirit involves first to have life and then to live.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be born is a once-for-all matter, but to have life and to live is not once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the contrary, it is a lifelong matter, for we are constantly receiving life in order to live.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, to stay alive we must breathe moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not sufficient to breathe only at the moment we are born.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In like manner, we need to receive life moment by moment in order to live.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To live by the Spirit is, therefore, to have life and then to live.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we have life and live, we are able to walk, to have our being in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>WALKING ABOUT AND WALKING IN LINE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we consider the two kinds of walk by the Spirit, we shall refer to the walk in 5:16 as the first kind and to that in 5:25 as the second.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek word for walk in verse 16, peripateo, means to have our being, to deport ourselves, to order our manner of life, to walk about.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is used with respect to ordinary daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It denotes a common, habitual daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This understanding of walking by the Spirit is confirmed by verses 22 and 23, where Paul speaks of the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in these verses are not unusual things; they are aspects of our ordinary daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the walk in verse 16 is our habitual and common daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word for walk in verse 25, stoicheo, has a very different meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is derived from a root which means to arrange in a line.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This may be illustrated by the movement of traffic in designated lanes on a highway.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the Greek word for walk here means to walk in line.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It also means to march in military rank.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Walking in this way, like soldiers marching in rank, requires that we keep in step.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we compare these two kinds of walk, we see that the second is more regulated than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, both kinds of walk, the common, ordinary walk and the walking in line or in rank, are by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The same Greek word used for walk in 5:25 is also used elsewhere in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Romans 4:12 Paul speaks of those who walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here the walk is not the ordinary walk, but the walk that is regulated, a walk in a definite line.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this case, the walk is in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the walk in Romans 4:12 is not a common, ordinary walk; it is a definite, particular walk, the walk in the steps of Abraham s faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul s concept was that Abraham s faith was a lane in which we should walk and follow Abraham s steps.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Elsewhere in the book of Romans Paul used the Greek word for the first kind of walk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This word is used in Romans 6:4, where Paul says that we also should walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is also found in Romans 8:4, where Paul speaks of walking not according to flesh, but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The walk in these verses is the common, ordinary walk of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Philippians 3:16 Paul also speaks of the second kind of walk: Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here Paul uses the Greek word stoicheo to denote an orderly walk in line or military rank.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, in Philippians 3:17 and 18 he uses the Greek word for the first kind of walk to refer to the common, ordinary walk: Be imitators together of me, brothers, and observe attentively those who thus walk as you have us for an example.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul s use of two different Greek words for walk indicates clearly that there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit in the New Testament.</S>
