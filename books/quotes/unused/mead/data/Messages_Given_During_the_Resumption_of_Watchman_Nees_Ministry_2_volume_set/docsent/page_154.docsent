   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONSECRATION OF OUR BODIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING A MATTER OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>NOT CONFORMING TO THIS AGE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 12, the second definite thing concerning consecration is to be not conformed to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a difference between the age and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The world is kosmos; it is different from the age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The age is a part of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are different ages, such as the age of the Ching Dynasty, the age of the Chinese Republic, and the age of the "May 4th movement."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word age means the modern world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It means that part of the world that is before your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With different people, the age is different to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In north China today, a young bride-to-be would want a wall clock.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But fifty years ago, no one ever dreamed of having such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the age?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is something that touches your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The world is the whole thing, and the age is a part or a fragment of the whole thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A man can only touch the age that is partial; he can never touch the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, a man can only drop the age that is partial; he cannot drop the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, a person gives up the world through giving up the age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The real consecration is one in which a person presents his time and drops the age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a person only presents his time, his consecration is only a half consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The presenting of the time plus the dropping of the age equals a complete consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The presenting of the time and the dropping of the age are like the left and right hands; neither one can be missing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your age may be a house or a 1948 model car.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A person can say that he does not love the world, but he cannot say that he does not love the age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The world is too big; it is not movable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But a person can chip a piece off this world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person cannot move the world, but he can move such things as the rings and the diamonds.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those brothers who are in business have in their mind a set of abacus all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some would even give up their jobs as college professors or judges to engage themselves in business.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The most fashionable world today is to go into business.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>ONLY A DEFINITE CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>ENABLING US TO SERVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we give all our time to the Lord, we will have no more time to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the sisters will give to the Lord all the time that they devote to beautifying themselves before the mirror, they will find time to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we need today is to put into practice these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, the age has to decrease in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, the time we give to the Lord has to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, we have to learn to give more time to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, we have to learn to drop more of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do this, you will find yourself a person serving God.</S>
