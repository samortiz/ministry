   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"JESUS TOOK WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PETER AND JAMES AND JOHN"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 2 continues, "Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why did Jesus not take all of the twelve disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why did He only take these three disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All twelve disciples had Jesus Christ, but only three had the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Having the Son of God is having eternal life, but not everyone who has the Son of God has the revelation of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without the revelation of Jesus Christ, there will not be a clear and adequate realization of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord brought three disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank the Lord that at least three people were able to receive the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they can have the revelation, so can we.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"INTO A HIGH MOUNTAIN"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus brought the three disciples "up alone into a high mountain privately."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did the Lord bring the three disciples to a high mountain?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is because level ground is not the place for receiving revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moses was on a mountain when he received the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Elijah was on a mountain when he served as a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>High on the mountain is where one gets away from people, far away from the earth, and close to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To climb up a high mountain requires strength.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If one wants to receive revelation, he must leave all men behind to be far away from earth and close to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"HE WAS TRANSFIGURED BEFORE THEM"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While they were up on the high mountain, the Lord was transfigured before them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why was the Lord transfigured?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What would have happened if He had not been transfigured?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this verse we see that Jesus Christ is actually God in disguise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God were not disguised, we would all know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But God is disguised in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This makes it difficult for us to recognize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps we know that there was a carpenter in the land of Galilee, a man in Nazareth; perhaps we know that He was a brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a sense everyone who has read the Bible knows Him, because the Bible talks about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His name is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But those who only know Jesus Christ in this way do not really know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They merely know a "disguised" Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Jesus Christ whom the disciples knew was the "disguised" Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am afraid that the Jesus Christ we know is merely the Jesus Christ spoken of in the four Gospels or the Jesus Christ taught by some preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord's transfiguration was the Lord's removing of the "disguise" in front of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is essential for all of us to see the Lord who is outside the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we say that the disciples did not know the Lord, they could argue that they had a history of following the Lord for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is inaccurate to say that they did not know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we could not say that they really knew the Lord, because they were so ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the Lord had to be transfigured; He had to remove the disciples' veil of false knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God the Son manifested Himself on the mountain and removed the veil in order for man to know Him in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After Peter saw the Lord's transfiguration on the mountain, what did he say?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to 2 Peter 1:16-17 he said, "For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we became eyewitnesses of that One's majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For He received from God the Father honor and glory, a voice such as this being borne to Him by the magnificent glory: This is My Son, My Beloved, in whom I delight."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Peter had such great power and such clear understanding of the Lord's coming because he had received the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peter followed the Lord to the mount of transfiguration and experienced a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He saw the revelation of Jesus Christ, and his living was drastically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How do we know whether a person really knows the Lord and has seen the revelation of Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If one knows the Lord and has seen the revelation of Jesus Christ, his living will surely have a drastic change.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is an indicator that a person has received the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
