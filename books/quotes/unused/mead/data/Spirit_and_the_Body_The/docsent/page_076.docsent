   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADORNING THE LESS HONORABLE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider 1 Corinthians 12:22 and 23.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These verses say, "Nay, much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble, are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. What are the members which we think to be less honorable and which we clothe with more abundant honor?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As you consider your own body, do you know what members these are?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those members of the body which seem to be less honorable are the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1948 I was staying with Brother Nee in his hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At a certain point in our conversation, he said, "Witness, the more cultured people are, the more they adorn their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whether your culture is high or low is indicated by the way you adorn your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You northerners have higher culture than the southerners.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You never go around with bare feet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, you beautify them with socks and shoes."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I replied, "Brother Nee, the northerners adorn their feet because the weather there is cold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The southerners may simply wear a pair of slippers because the weather here is usually very warm."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee replied, "No, don't say this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even among the southerners, the highly cultured people do not go around with bare feet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They always spend money to beautify their feet."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day I was reading 1 Corinthians 12:21, where Paul says that the head cannot say to the feet, "I have no need of you."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The head should not say, "Feet, because you are so low, I don't need you."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the feet are so low, they need more adornment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose I were fully dressed with a suit and tie, but had no shoes and socks on.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Would you not say that it was shameful for me to be barefooted?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, you would not consider it shameful for my head or my hands to be uncovered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that the feet are the less honorable members of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because they are less honorable than the other members, we need to adorn them properly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we often damage the principle of the Body by adorning the head with many "hats," but not caring for the lower members, the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to bestow more honor on the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From now on, in all the churches and in all the meetings we must learn to clothe the lower members with more honor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not buy more "hats" for the head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, purchase "shoes" for the adornment of the feet so that you may beautify these less honorable parts of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>HONORING THOSE WHO SPEAK HALTINGLY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today, however, we often follow the despicable practice of crowning the eloquent speakers with honor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sisters admire eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Certain sisters may place several crowns upon the head of an eloquent one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I were an eloquent speaker and my speech were like music, the sisters would find it entertaining and would say, "Let us go to hear Brother Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His speaking is so pleasant."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the sisters would purchase crowns for me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But suppose I spoke in a very halting way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Finding listening to me unbearable, everyone would want me to sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead of clothing me with honor, they would deprive me of whatever adornment I had for my uncomely feet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They would strip me in order to suppress me from speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, we must thank God that He has brought so many halting speakers into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Which do you prefer the head or the feet?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Throughout the years of the church life in California, we have not spent a penny to adorn the head.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we have spent a great deal to buy socks and shoes to beautify the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is precisely Paul's meaning when he says that the members that seem to be less honorable are clothed with more abundant honor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all need to learn to exercise ourselves as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From now on, we should no longer regard eloquence so highly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead, we should honor those who speak haltingly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you hear this, you may say, "Brother Lee, this is too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eloquence is so sweet and musical.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I cannot tolerate listening to halting speech."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you cannot tolerate it, it is an indication that you are natural and not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Body life every member is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to have the church life, the Body life, we need all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The services in Christianity today are a form of entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Both the singers and the speakers entertain the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the seminaries men are taught to speak eloquently and are taught how to attract people and to entertain them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a shame it is to speak eloquently to entertain people!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are not here for this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, we must either crucify people or resurrect them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead of entertainment, we have the experience of the cross.</S>
