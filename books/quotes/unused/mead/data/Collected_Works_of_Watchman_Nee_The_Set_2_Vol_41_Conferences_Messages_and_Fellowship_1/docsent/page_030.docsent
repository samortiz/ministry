   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Boasting in One's Own Weakness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people are familiar with the first part of 2 Corinthians 12:9, but they forget about the second part of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we will pay special attention to the second part of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul said that he most gladly boasted in his weaknesses so that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Weakness implies that a man is very vulnerable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Paul was weak, what did he do?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Did he cry?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No, he boasted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He boasted that weakness to him was a grace and a glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He boasted and gloried in his weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said, "I am indeed weak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I thank and praise the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was Paul's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was his boast and his glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"I may be weak, but I thank and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I cannot overcome the temptations, yet I thank God in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have we thanked God in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have we given thanks in everything?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should go to the Lord and say, "I thank You that I cannot remove my filthy thoughts, pride, jealousy, and temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God, I do not intend to remove my filthy thoughts, pride, jealousy, and temper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I cannot do anything, and I do not intend to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I thank and praise you that I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am weak, and I boast in my weakness."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Last year I met a brother who was a general in the Manchuria Volunteer Army.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He fought many battles against the Japanese in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the war, his sense of moral and human decency went completely bankrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later he heard that a brother was preaching the gospel in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He went and was saved and became a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, he also married a sister in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because he was fearful of the Japanese, he decided to move to Shantung to practice medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There was a meeting in the place where he was, and he went and joined their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was there last year, I met him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first day I met him, I felt that there was something strange about him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He dressed well and was a nice man, but he seemed a little impolite.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When he came into the room, he did not take off his hat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I became interested in him and took special notice of him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>During those few days, I was conducting a conference on the subject of Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day after a meeting, he told me that he had something very important to discuss with me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I told him that he could come the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He asked if he could come at six in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I told him that I was staying at someone else's home and that it might not be convenient for the host to receive him so early.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I suggested that he should come at seven instead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The next morning I went downstairs after my morning watch, and he was waiting for me at seven o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was a husky and tall man, a typical northern Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet he began to cry in front of me and said, "I have one sin which I have not been able to overcome for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was in the army, others were smoking opium, but I chose to smoke cigarettes instead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes I would smoke over twenty cigarettes a day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later, I became a Christian and married my present wife.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I want very much to quit smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have tried many times but failed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have been quitting and smoking, quitting and smoking, continually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am very much bothered by this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It became worse when I moved to Shantung.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I smoke on the streets, I worry that some brothers may see me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If I smoke in the hospital, I am afraid that the nurses who are sisters may see and criticize me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If I smoke at home, my wife will bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The only way I can smoke is to smoke in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As soon as I hear someone coming, I hide my cigarette.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a great suffering to me, but I can do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the past, I killed my enemies with a gun, but I could not stop my smoking, even if I had a gun.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During the past few months, I have been very troubled by this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Mr. Nee, what should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>While he was speaking, I looked at him and laughed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I said, "I am so happy to meet people like you."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He said, "Mr. Nee, please do not make fun of me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am desperate, and yet you are laughing."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I said, "It does not matter if you smoke, and it does not matter if you cannot quit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All you need to do is one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He said, "What is it?"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I said, "Suppose I come to your hospital today to be a patient and signed a contract with you to stay in the hospital indefinitely.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What would you say?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He said, "If you are not sick, the hospital cannot admit you."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I then asked, "What kind of people do you admit?"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He answered, "Only those who are sick."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I said, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now you should go to the Lord and say, Lord, I thank and praise You because I smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I thank and praise You because I cannot quit smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I can quit for five days, but then I have to smoke again.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I am qualified to come to You.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Your Word says that a healthy person does not need a doctor; only those who are sick need a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If I could make it by myself, I would not need You.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But I cannot make it; therefore, I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I am a patient, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I come to You.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I thank and praise You.'"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He replied, "I can praise Him for many other things, but I cannot praise Him for this.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I have never thanked and praised Him according to your prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I then showed him 2 Corinthians 12:9 and told him how Paul would much rather boast in his weaknesses so that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I said, "You weep for your weakness, but Paul boasted in his weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What a difference there is!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You have to boast in your weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You have to say to the Lord, I have sinned, and I cannot overcome my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I cannot quit smoking by myself, and I will no longer resolve to quit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I commit myself to You.'"</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After this the two of us knelt down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He prayed to the Lord saying, "I am a sinner, and I cannot overcome my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I will not try to make it, and I will not even think about making it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I commit this matter to you.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>May Your power be manifested in me.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I cannot do it, but You can do it."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After he made such a prayer, he said nothing more, but picked up his hat and was ready to go.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I called him back and asked, "Will you smoke after you go home?"</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He said, "By myself I will smoke and I cannot quit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But God will quit for me.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If I quit, it is the Lord who is quitting for me."</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>After he returned home, I was concerned for him and wondered if he was truly released.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>After two days I did not hear any news from him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Every day he stood up after the meeting and left.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I sent men to inquire about his condition, but received no reply.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>One time after my message I saw him again and asked him, "Are you still smoking?"</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He answered, "No!</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But I argued with my wife for a whole day."</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I thought, "One sin has left and another is coming along the way!"</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>He went on, "I argued with my wife and told her that I had tried quitting without success and that she had been grating on me for over two years without result, but this time God did it for me.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I dropped it just like that."</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I said, "If that is what you were arguing about, it is all right."</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I stayed there for three more weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>He testified at the end, "My addiction to cigarettes is completely gone.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>I have no desire to smoke any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Satan tempted me twice, but I did not tell him that I would not smoke anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I merely said that by myself I could still smoke, but that God could stop smoking for me.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I do not have to be concerned about the matter anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>It was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>When I did not move, even when temptation came along, I found that I was able to overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Today he is still victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Some time ago, I received a letter from Shantung saying that this brother has indeed overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Brothers and sisters, you must realize that you cannot make it, and you must not try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Furthermore, you must boast of the fact that you cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>If you do this, nothing will stop God's power from being manifested in you.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If you move, you will frustrate God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Do not try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Let the temptation come and go.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>There is no need to resist the temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Of course, resisting Satan is another thing that has to do with spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>There is no need for you to be concerned with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>You only need to say, "Thank the Lord, I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>I cannot overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Many people like to put their titles on their name cards.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We should write on our name cards "Specialist in Sin."</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We are experts at sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>We cannot do anything other than committing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>We have to say to the Lord, "I can only sin.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>I am weak and can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>You are the One who can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Please be the One who makes it for me.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>I thank You that I have no way to help myself.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>You have the way.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>I am powerless, but You have the power to resist for me."</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>If we stand on this ground, we will overcome all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>I can give a testimony concerning myself.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>At one time I had a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Two classmates of mine can testify concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Many years ago when I was in Shanghai, Satan came to me again and again to tempt me.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Sometimes others would say something that was irritating.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>I did not want to hear it, and I felt uncomfortable inside when I did.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Satan would come and tempt me and stir up my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>I knew that I could not control my temper; I wanted to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Before I knew the overcoming truth, I would suppress my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Sometimes the temper was not in my mouth, but it would still be inside me.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Even when I appeared calm and meek outwardly, I was still fighting the temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>I was merely suppressing my temper with my own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>Later Christ showed me a little of what victory is.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>He showed me that Christ within could overcome my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>Every time I began to lose my temper, I told the Lord, "I can lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>I enjoy losing my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>I am about to lose my temper, and I even want to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>But Lord, You do not lose any temper.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>You are my victory within.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>I cannot make it, but You can.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>I cannot do it, but You can.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>I believe that You can overcome my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>By praying this way, I experienced the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Our victory is absolutely in Christ, not in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>If we drop ourselves and do not struggle, strive, or come up with our own ways, and instead believe in Christ and trust in Him as our victory, we will experience the overcoming power of Christ continually.</S>
