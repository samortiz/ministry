<h2 class="head1">THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS</h2><h2 class="head2">One Must Be a Regenerated Person</h2><p>Brother Chu: How do we exercise ourselves to develop a spiritual consciousness?</p><p>Watchman Nee: In order to answer this question we have to come back to the starting point&mdash;regeneration. Suppose we try to explain the colors white and red to a man who is born blind. We may tell him that something that looks white is white or something that looks red is red. But He will not understand what we are saying. Even if the blind man is very intelligent, he will not understand what color is. Intelligence and color are things that belong to two different worlds.</p><p>In John 3 the Lord Jesus said that unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God (v. 3). He meant that in order to know the things of God's kingdom, that is, in order to know the spiritual things, one must be born again. The things related to God's kingdom, the things of the spirit, cannot be understood by a man of flesh. One can only understand it as his spiritual consciousness develops. In order to have spiritual consciousness, one has to begin from regeneration. After a man is regenerated, the Lord plants a spiritual consciousness within him.</p><h2 class="head2">A Thorough Consecration</h2><p>Second, you must have a thorough consecration. This is what Romans 12:1-2 speaks of in presenting ourselves as a living sacrifice, being transformed by the renewing of the mind, and then proving God's will. Some people are indeed saved. In fact they have been saved for many years already. But we cannot get through with them concerning any spiritual thing. They are like a piece of wood or stone when it comes to spiritual things. They have no spiritual feeling at all. This is because they have a problem with their consecration. In the church we can find brothers and sisters who experience a sudden opening of their understanding. If we trace the cause of this opening, we will discover that these ones have made a thorough consecration before the Lord. To a Christian, consecration is the necessary step after regeneration. We can talk to some people about any worldly matter from music to politics to philosophy. They may be good at them all, but when you talk to them about spiritual things, they may not understand anything. Only spiritual ones can discern spiritual things. Worldly wisdom and human cleverness cannot discern spiritual things (1 Cor. 2:8, 10).</p><p>The word mind in Romans 12 is nous in Greek. It can be translated as understanding. Formerly, our spirit was dead. Through the quickening of the Holy Spirit, it is now able to communicate with God. But we still need the renewing of our understanding before we can know the good, well pleasing, and perfect will of God revealed to us in our spirit. Our understanding needs to be renewed all the time. The spiritual consciousness of the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong is weak because their understanding is not renewed.</p><p>Please forgive me for saying a frank word. A person is dull in his spiritual consciousness because his understanding is not renewed, and his understanding is not renewed because he has a problem with his consecration. I have not seen a man who is truly and thoroughly consecrated who has a dull spirit. A thoroughly consecrated person is one who is a living sacrifice all the time. The stronger the consecration, the more the understanding opens up. Only consecration will give the Holy Spirit the proper ground He owns in the church. Once we hold back anything in our consecration, the Holy Spirit is frustrated from gaining the full ground in the church. Hence, consecration is an indispensable step in removing the negative hindrances.</p>
