   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Traveling for three days Verse 4 indicates that Abraham traveled for three days, for we are told that on the third day he saw the appointed place afar off.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the eyes of God and according to Abraham's feeling, Isaac had been killed for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the third day Abraham not only offered Isaac; he also received him back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, the third day is surely a sign of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very meaningful that the Bible does not call it the second or fourth day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you look at a map, you will see that the distance between Beer-sheba and Moriah is approximately fifty-five miles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the ancient method of travel, it would have taken two days to journey from Beer-sheba to Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the third day Abraham put Isaac on the altar, and then what he offered to God was given back to him in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all must see the seed here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Praise the Lord that today we are Isaacs, not Ishmaels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not journeying southward toward Egypt; we are traveling northward to Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to see this, we must have the life at Beer-sheba, because only this life builds us up and qualifies us to be the burnt offering for God's satisfaction and to receive the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The name Moriah means "the vision of Jah," that is, the vision of Jehovah, the vision of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This has two meanings that we see the Lord and that the Lord sees us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On Mount Moriah Abraham undoubtedly saw God and God saw him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, on today's Mount Zion we have a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no cloud here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not in darkness; we are in the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church life is a vision in which we see God and God sees us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The translators are troubled about how to render verse 14, uncertain whether it should be "in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen" or "it shall be provided."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the King James Version, verse 14 says, "And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Other versions say, "In the mount of the Lord it shall be provided."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some versions even say, "On the mount of the Lord he will see."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although this verse is difficult to translate, it is easy to understand according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's provision is always His vision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we participate in and enjoy God's provision, we have a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We see God and He sees us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because we are in His provision and have the vision, everything is clear, nothing is opaque, and there is no separation between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Where is God's provision today?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is in the church life on Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all can testify what a provision there is in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we are enjoying the provision, what a vision we have!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We see God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We see eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here in the church life everything is crystal clear and transparent in God's eyes and in ours, and nothing is opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We did not have this experience in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we were there, we were in a low dungeon that was opaque on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But today in the church life on Mount Zion we have the full provision with the full vision.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We see God and are seen by Him; God sees us and is seen by us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In God's provision, everything is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Building an altar and offering Isaac Abraham went to a primitive region, built an altar on a mountain, and there offered his only son Isaac vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To build an altar there was not easy, and to offer his only son by killing him was even more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But he did this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He truly meant business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We also must build an altar and offer what God demands.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This surely will cost us something.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have seen the record of Abraham's obedience by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The faith with which he was thoroughly infused by God gave him this obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was this infused faith that brought him to Mount Moriah where he enjoyed God's provision and had a thoroughly transparent vision from God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time there was no one on earth nor in the whole universe who was as clear about divine things as Abraham was.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There, on Mount Moriah, Abraham experienced God's provision and received a clear vision.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything was clear in his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must not read Genesis 22 merely as a story.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must receive divine light from it and see that Abraham's experience is being repeated in us today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praise the Lord that we have today's Beer-sheba and Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are not going downward to Egypt; we are traveling upward to Mount Moriah, where we shall enjoy God's provision and have a transparent vision.</S>
