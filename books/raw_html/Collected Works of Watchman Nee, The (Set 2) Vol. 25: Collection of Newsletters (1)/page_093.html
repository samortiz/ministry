<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from Ting Pu, P'ing Yang, Chekiang</H2><P>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Wu Sheng:</P><P>I have been lying in bed all day for the past few days. I am physically exhausted. I do not have the strength to get up and move around. I have no energy to speak or be social. I really hope to take a trip to Wu Tai, Ch'iao Tun. However, it does not look like I will be able to fulfill this desire in the near future. I hope you will pray for me. With respect to the brothers in Kuan Mei, Wu Tai, or any other place, if they zealously desire to be baptized, we will baptize them. But it is best that we are not directed by our emotions. This is crucial. (Parts omitted.) Thank the Lord! I bless you with peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your brother,<br>Wang Yu T'ing<br>June 6</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from Yung Chia, Wenchow, Chekiang</H2><P>To the brother in the Lord, Mr. Chang:</P><P>May God bless you and give you peace. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>My whole family came out of the denominations (China Inland Mission outside the great South Gate in Wenchow) on April 11 and we moved to the north end of Wu T'ien Street. It is about ten miles from the town. We opened a small Chinese and Western medical hospital. My husband (Mr. Huang Lan Ju) is in much better physical health. We should thank God unceasingly for His grace. I only feel that we are very immature in our spiritual journey. I have many kinds of worldly affairs and I do not have much time to read the Bible or pray. It is really dangerous. I hope the Lord can bring me to an appropriate place to live a spiritual life in order to walk in the way of the cross and wait for the Lord's coming. I do not know yet what the Lord's will is. Please pray for me. I will tell you more another day. Until we meet again.</P><P>Your little sister in the Lord,<br>Mu Chen<br>June 18</P><P>(The place where our whole family worships on the Lord's Day is at Sha Mao River in the town.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Recent News from<br>Hu Shan, P'ing Yang, Chekiang</H2><P>To my brother in the Lord, Wu Sheng:</P><P>I am sure that you have received and read my last letter. Praise God, He hears the prayers of His children. The winds and waves are calm now and Sister Shu Liang has been comforted by the Lord. She has received happiness in her spirit and peace in her body. Thank the Lord, and thank you for your prayer.</P><P>Brother Hsu Jung San from Feng Chuan met with me a few days ago and talked about the meeting in his locality. They hope that after the fall they can have a conference there. They plan to invite Brother Wang Yu T'ing to lead the conference. Please notify him in advance. We would like to know how he is right now. Brother Hua Shih Pin wrote us a letter asking me to go to visit him. It seems that I will not have the opportunity soon, so I am asking you to greet him for us.</P><P>Brother Hua Shih Pin led a conference in Ch'u Chou from June 1 to June 11. God had already begun working there. After the conference he went to Hangchow and saw Brother Watchman Nee, Brother Witness Lee, and Brother Chou Fu An. He stayed there two days and then went to Shanghai for one night before going to Ningpo for one day. He preached the gospel there with Brother David Hsu before returning home. There will be a workers meeting in Ning Hai from July 17-27. Brother David Hsu will preach the Word and lead the Bible study. Please notify the brothers to pray much. I am now in Hsia Hsi of Pei Kang. We have decided to begin the meetings on July 25. I also ask you to please pray for this matter. Ask the Lord that it be His own work so that His name will be glorified greatly. May God be with you and all the brothers and sisters. Amen.</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Chou Ta Ching<br>July 10, 1934</P>
