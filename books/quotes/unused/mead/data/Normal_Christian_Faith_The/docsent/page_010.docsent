   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CALL ON GOD IN DANGER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once a missionary to South America saw a man preaching before a crowd in an open space in a forest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The man forcefully and vehemently denied the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With enthusiasm he gave more than ten reasons, one after another, to prove the nonexistence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After he finished speaking, he asked, "Is there any one of you who would like to object?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please come up here."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For a while there was silence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The missionary decided that he should say something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He stood up and told the crowd, "Friends, I cannot give many reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can only give facts and tell you a story.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yesterday I was walking along the bank of the big river which, as you all know, is very rapid and leads to a treacherous waterfall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was at the bank and I heard a man shouting for help.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He distinctly cried, O God!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Save me!'</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I ran toward the sound and found a man in the midst of the river tumbling toward the waterfall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without hesitation or thought of danger, I jumped into the river.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The torrent was rapid, and I fought hard to keep myself from being swept under.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fortunately, I was quite strong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With one arm around him and the other swimming through the water, I managed to drag him ashore.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After I did this, I felt quite happy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you know who the man who was crying to God for help is?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let me introduce him to you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At these words he pointed towards the man who just made the speech.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"The one who called on God yesterday," he concluded, "is the same one who denies God today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what you call an atheist!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All problems come from inside.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a man is on the border of life and death, he calls on God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When danger is over, he argues and denies God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our heart we all know that there is a God; there is no question about it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know it because there is a capacity for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The capacity for God proves that there is God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>IS PRAYER ANSWERED?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should look not only at objective phenomena but also at our own subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know that God answers prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once I spoke to a person who resolutely denied the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I told him not to be too bold or presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The history of mankind is about five to six thousand years old.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During this span of time, countless numbers of people both in Christianity and outside have prayed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Can you prove that not even one of these many prayers, throughout many years and among many people, has been answered?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Are you so bold as to brush aside with one stroke the validity of all answers to prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These people prayed to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Can you say that none of their prayers were answered?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me testify that not only have there been one or two answers; there have been countless answers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, one answer would suffice to prove the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Friends, do you think that there has never been an answer to prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Would you say that all answers to prayer are false?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I personally have had at least two to three thousand answers to prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is it conceivable to regard them all as mere coincidences?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many other people had their prayers answered.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are all those also coincidences?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once a preacher was traveling across the Atlantic when a thick fog suddenly surrounded the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The vessel could not proceed and had to be anchored in the middle of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The man went to the captain and said, "You have to hoist the sail again; I am scheduled to preach in Quebec on Tuesday."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The captain replied, "Do you see the thick fog?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is impossible for the ship to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you can pray to dispel the fog, I will surely pull up my anchor."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The preacher answered, "Go right ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am going to pray right here while you pull up the anchor.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no time to lose."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He began to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The captain began to work on the anchor as the preacher prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the anchor was up, the fog was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The ship arrived on time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Was this a coincidence?</S>
