<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE PROPHECIES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:14; 6:57a; Eph. 1:22-23; John 3:29; Rev. 21:9-10; Gen. 3:15; 22:18; Isa. 11:1, 10; 7:14; 9:6; 53:2; Micah 5:2; Gen. 2:21-24; Psa. 22:22; Isa. 8:18</h1><p>The focus of these messages is a general sketch of the New Testament in the light of Christ and the church. Here we cannot deal with many details, but by the grace of the Lord, we will see the main points and the main line of the New Testament.<p>In order to know the sketch of the New Testament, we must see something concerning the entire Scriptures. First, the entire Scriptures reveal not only the nature and character of God but also His purpose. In fact, the Scriptures may reveal God’s purpose more than His character and nature because the entire Bible is a book showing us God’s plan; it is a book unveiling the purpose of God. What is the purpose of God? In brief, God’s eternal purpose and intention are to have a group of living persons mingled with Himself as one to be His living, corporate expression.<p>Second, the Old Testament, the first main part of the Scriptures, contains types and prophecies as figures, shadows, and predictions concerning the purpose of God. In the Old Testament are all the figures, shadows, and pictures which describe, portray, or predict God’s eternal purpose.<p>Third, the New Testament contains the fulfillment of the types and prophecies concerning God’s eternal purpose. By this brief and clear word we can see that the entire Scriptures are a book of God’s purpose: The Old Testament contains the shadows and figures of God’s purpose, and the New Testament contains the fulfillment of His purpose. With this understanding and realization, we can better understand the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class=head2>Incarnation</h2><p>To grasp a few significant items is sufficient for us to understand the entire New Testament. The first significant and prominent item mentioned and recorded in the New Testament is that one day God came into man to be mingled with man and to become a man. The almighty Creator of the universe came into one of His creatures, man. This is wonderful! Before incarnation, God was God and man was man; the Creator was the Creator, the creature was the creature, and the two were not one. Incarnation, however, is a real landmark in time, dividing the dispensation of the Old Testament from that of the New Testament. It is a landmark at which something wonderful, magnificent, marvelous, and indescribable happened: The Creator mingled Himself with one of His creatures—man—and He Himself became a man.<h2 class=head2>A Wonderful Life and Living</h2><p>Second, the New Testament shows us a wonderful living, a walk as the expression of an inner life. On this earth the Lord Jesus had the living of the divine life through the human life. The wonderful living of the Lord Jesus spoken of and recorded in the four Gospels was the issue of the mingling of the divine life with the human life. In other words, God was lived out through man in a wonderful living. In this living we can see God expressed through man and God and man mingled as one. If we read the four Gospels again with this light and from this point of view, we will have a new understanding of the record of these four books. They show us the wonderful living of God Himself through man and among men.
