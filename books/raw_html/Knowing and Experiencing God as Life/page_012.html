        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">TAKING GOD AS LIFE AND LIVING BY HIM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 3:22-24; John 1:1, 4, 14; 6:57; 14:10; 12:24; 19:34; Heb. 4:16; 10:19-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING MAN TO RECEIVE HIM AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Most people have the concept that they should worship and serve God and do something for Him. This, however, is not what God requires of man. At the beginning of the Bible, God presented Himself as food to man so that man could receive Him (Gen. 2:8-9). He wanted man to receive Him as food so that He could enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. The first two chapters of Genesis show that among all the creatures created by God, man is the highest creature and possesses the highest life. Man has God&rsquo;s image and likeness to express God and to represent Him with authority, that is, to rule over everything created by God (1:26). However, man did not have God&rsquo;s life; God was not in man. God wanted man to receive Him as life. Therefore, after He created man, God placed man before the tree of life.</p>
<p>The tree of life indicates that God wants to be man&rsquo;s life. God placed Himself before man as the tree of life, indicating that He wanted man to receive Him as food. God wants to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s nourishment and even become man&rsquo;s constitution, just as the food we eat becomes our nourishment and our constitution. In this way God is mingled with us as one, and we can live by Him and because of Him. He wants to be our life, and He wants us to express Him. This is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>If we can receive God, live by Him, and let Him live in us, we will have many wonderful experiences. God has no intention for us to do something for Him. What He asks of us is that we allow Him to enter into us to be our life and do everything through us. He wants us to do everything by Him as our life. In other words, what we do is secondary. The primary matter is that we take Him in as life. This is His primary thought.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FALL BEING TO NOT LIVE BY GOD</h2>
<p>Before man received God as his life, the devil seduced man and caused him to receive the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the tree of life. Thus, man fell away from God&rsquo;s goal. The tree of life points to God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil points to Satan. The result of eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death (2:17), and Satan is the source of death. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil denotes Satan, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14). On one side of man was the tree of life, which denotes the God of life, and on the other side of man was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which denotes Satan with the might of death. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil indicates that death is expressed as good, evil, and knowledge. The result of contacting God is life, but the result of contacting Satan is death. God expresses Himself as life, but Satan expresses himself as good, evil, and knowledge. Satan uses good, evil, and knowledge to seduce man away from God and the divine life.</p>
<p>The real meaning of man&rsquo;s fall is that instead of choosing God as his life, man chose good, evil, and knowledge. Whenever a person chooses good, evil, or knowledge instead of God as life, that person is in the fall. Adam fell when he turned to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This same principle applies to us today. When we attempt to do things apart from God&rsquo;s life, we have departed from the tree of life and have received the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The result of such a choice is death. This is a serious matter.</p>
<p>Many of God&rsquo;s children know the difference between good and evil but not the difference between life and good. When we see a brother who is humble, polite, and loves others, we say that he is a good brother. When we see a brother who rebukes and mistreats others, we say that he is a bad brother. It is easy to differentiate between good and bad, or good and evil. However, it is not so easy for us to determine whether the humility of a humble brother is of life or whether it is of himself.</p>
<p>Life is the expression of God, but good is merely something worked out. If a brother is able to love others and is humble and meek without needing to let God be his life, his conduct is good but not life. His living is not the result of God living out from within him, and God has no place in his living. When we let God be our life, live by Him, and let Him live out of us, we are in life. When we deny ourselves and cooperate with God by allowing Him to operate in us, He will bring us into loving others, and He will become our humility and our meekness. On the surface, there is no difference in our love, humility, and meekness, but in actuality, our love, humility, and meekness are God. Instead of merely being our outward goodness, they are an expression of our inner life.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many of God&rsquo;s children do not know the difference between good and life. They know to condemn evil, but they do not know to condemn good. Both those who commit sins and do evil and those who are good and do good deeds are living according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; they are not touching life. In other words, they remain in the fall of man. We do not need to commit sins in order to be in the fall. We are in the fall when we do not live in God as life.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother habitually gambles, goes dancing, and even lives in dissipation; we would all say that he is in the fall. Suppose another brother bears some responsibility in the church meetings, likes to preach the gospel, and enthusiastically participates in various services; we would say that he is not in the fall. However, his activities do not necessarily indicate that he is not in the fall. We must ask whether he serves by God or by himself. Is this his pious and religious living, or is it the living out of God as life? If he does not live by the life of God, his piety is in the fall. This is not a fall from good to evil or from serving God to committing sins but a fall from living by the divine life to living apart from the divine life, from being in God to being apart from God.</p>
<p>We need to see that the fall of man is a matter of man not letting God be his life. Just as man is capable of doing evil things without the life of God, he is also capable of doing good things without the life of God. Regardless of whether man does good or evil, as long as he is apart from the life of God, not taking God as life or living by God, he is fallen.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
