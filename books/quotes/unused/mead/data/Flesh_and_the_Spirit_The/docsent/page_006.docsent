   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING FORCED BY THE FLESH TO TURN TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now I would like us to see that this flesh eventually is good for us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How is it good for us?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is good for us because it forces us to go to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have something so bad and so evil that we can never deal with it, yet it would never go away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is always here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many years ago I read a number of books telling me the ways to be holy and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I tried these ways.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At first they worked a little bit, but for the long run, none of these ways worked.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result, I became fully disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I found out that this poor flesh is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I wondered why the Lord would not take away our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I thought that if He would take away the flesh, everything would be okay.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the cross Christ terminated everything, but we may wonder why He still left this ugly flesh with us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It seems that the more we pray to deal with the flesh, the more we are bothered by the flesh and the more active our flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems that we can never overcome the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, I told the Lord, "Since You do not take away my flesh, I will not try to be good any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I give up trying to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I give up trying to be victorious."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord told me, "Child, that's wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That's exactly what I want you to do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to give up trying to overcome the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, the Lord showed me that He left the flesh with us for our good because it helps us and forces us to turn to Him, to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we did not have such an evil thing as the flesh with us, we might not pray so desperately.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This flesh helps us and forces us to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are forced by the hopeless flesh to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not turn to the Lord, this is really bad.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if the flesh forces us to turn to the Lord, this is really good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can say, "Thank You, Lord, for the help from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank You, Lord, that You can even be so sovereign to use my flesh to force me to turn to my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you still bothered by the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You had better say, "Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The flesh helps me and forces me to turn to the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to realize that the flesh and the spirit are very close to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 8:6 says that to set our mind upon the flesh is death, but to set our mind upon the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 4 says that we are to walk according to the spirit, not according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 8:10 says that if Christ is in us, our body is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That means our body is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if the Spirit dwells in us, our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can see from these verses that the Bible puts the flesh so close to the spirit.</S>
