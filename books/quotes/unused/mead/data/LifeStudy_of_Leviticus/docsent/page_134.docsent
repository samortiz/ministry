   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY UNCLEANNESS ISSUING FROM WITHIN MAN 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 13:29-31, 33, 34b, 37-41, 45-46; 1 Cor 5:13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we covered leprosy in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider leprosy in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>V. A DISEASE ON THE HEAD AND ON THE BEARD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Leviticus 13:29 speaks of a disease on the head and on the beard.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible the head, especially the hair of the head, signifies our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 11 indicates that hair is related to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A beard is related not to glory but to dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not easy to explain what dignity is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It would not be adequate to say that dignity is a kind of honor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Dignity is actually self-assumed honor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A person of high social standing may be honored by others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if a person assumes honor, that is a matter of dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Spiritually speaking, a beard is related to dignity, to one's self-assumed honor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To have a beard is to display one's dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that there can be a disease on the head, which signifies glory, and on the beard, which signifies dignity, indicates that it is easy for leprosy to be hidden within human glory and dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not leprous for a person to be honored, but it is leprous for one to assume honor to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Leviticus 13, in which we see God's wisdom, gives us a divine diagnosis of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Leprosy is a synonym of sin, and sin is a synonym of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sin is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the universe there is actually only one sin, and this sin is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the principles set up by God in His creation, everything is in order and is related to a certain kind of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is authority everywhere in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is authority in the family and in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there were no authority in this country, there could not be any peace or order.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rebellion is versus authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who rebel oppose authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the divine sense, authority is a synonym of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is the authority in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan tried to break this divine authority, but he failed and was judged for his rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today as God's created, chosen, redeemed, and saved people, and especially as His regenerated children, we should be the most submissive, obedient ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 5 indicates that to sin is to be disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sin came into the human race through the disobedience of Adam v. 19 . Do you know what disobedience is? It is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Disobedience is a synonym of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Disobedience is rebellion, and rebellion is a synonym of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as rebellion is a synonym of Satan, so authority is a synonym of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Anything that is related to rebellion is of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The expression of rebellion in us today has many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every aspect is a sin or a trespass or a transgression or an overstepping or an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These things may be small in appearance, but they all are expressions of the unique sin rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to remember that the source of sin is rebellion and that rebellion is Satan's invention.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sin, therefore, comes from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, every kind of sin has the nature of rebellion and bears the appearance of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even the smallest sin contains the element of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, to sin is to be in rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we sin we rebel against God.</S>
