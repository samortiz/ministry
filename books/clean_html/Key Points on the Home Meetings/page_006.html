<h2 class="head1">BUILDING PEOPLE UP IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>When you help people to read the footnotes and the Life-study messages, you must be careful. Do not give others the impression that you are a leader or a core member. We must learn this one thing: never assume the position of a leader. You must be very natural. When no one has anything to say, you start by speaking something in order to help everyone to exercise. Those who are there for the first time will not be accustomed to this. For this reason you must bring them slowly into this kind of exercise. A home meeting of eight to ten people is very easy to help in this way. We must practice this regularly over a period of time. Do this once a week, fifty-two weeks a year. I believe that if you brothers are faithful and patient to practice this steadily for a year, surely many people will be built up by the end of that year. We only need to try it for a year. Many results will be seen. Once people are built up, they will be very useful. Anyone will then be able to speak for the Lord. They can speak for the Lord at home, to their neighbors, friends, and relatives. The effect will be far reaching.</p>
<p>You all know of the American soft drink company Coca-Cola. Apparently, they are selling a drink to people and earning a very small amount of money per drink. But when you add the small amounts together, it is a lot of money. If we all speak the Lord&rsquo;s word today, this will have a great impact. In September, Taipei had a &ldquo;gospel week.&rdquo; There were no big gospel meetings, but for one week the brothers and sisters went out to contact people one-on-one. Everyone spoke. You brought 1,104 people to the Lord. This is the best proof. We should not underestimate the &ldquo;small&rdquo; things. What we are after is the &ldquo;widespreading.&rdquo; If everyone would rise up to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, the gospel will spread out quickly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD IN THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>If three gospel friends come to your home meeting, you cannot ignore them. You can still use the verses from Galatians. But when you use them, you must use them in the way of gospel preaching. You need to learn to say, &ldquo;The Bible says, &lsquo;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&rsquo; We human beings are all fallen. We are born in the flesh, and the flesh is fallen....&rdquo; Your speaking can go from the flesh to the spirit. This is a very good gospel message. You may say, &ldquo;When we live in ourselves, we cannot escape corruption. We have no way to overcome the flesh. But when we believe in the Lord Jesus and we call on His name, His Spirit comes into ours. He produces fruits of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control.&rdquo; If you speak this way, people will certainly be able to understand, and they will certainly admire the gospel. To preach the gospel in this way will also nourish the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>I hope that you brothers and sisters would also learn to sing hymns. For the long run we all need to exercise to sing the hymns together in a harmonious way. I believe the dormant saints will be recovered and the newly saved ones will be added. We need to do our best to attach ourselves to them. The foundation for the building of the church is the home meetings. We all need to change our concept and habit. From now on, we will not have any more hierarchy. All are members of the Body. Each one must function actively.</p>
