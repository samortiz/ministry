   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY GOD WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:January 11, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: Eph 2:10; 3:17-20 GOD'S CENTRAL GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Throughout the ages, God has only one work, and that is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hope that everyone sitting here can listen carefully to this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why did God create the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why did He create man?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why did He create you?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is God trying to accomplish?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is an important question.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God wants to do something, and you do not know about it, your Christian life is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may think that God's intention is for you to have joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is true that God wants you to have joy and peace, but these things are not God's center.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is not merely giving you peace, blessings, forgiveness, eternal life, and so forth; His central thought is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the ultimate goal of God in the old creation as well as in the new?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's redemption is for this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He created the universe in order to put man in it, and the purpose for Him to have man is to work Himself into him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I cannot tell you why God wants to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But I do know that this is His desire; He wants to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A light bulb is very good to look at.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if you ask the designer who designed it, he will tell you that the bulb is not made just to be good to look at.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It has one specific goal, and that is to transmit electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If electricity is not transmitted into it, all the electric wires and electric poles will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the function of the electric wires and poles?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are there to transmit electricity to the light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone, whether male or female, young or old, honorable or lowly, exists for his three meals a day only.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He eats so that he can work, and he works so that he can eat.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some say that they live for society or for their country.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These are lies; they are but beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The best liars are the social reformers and the politicians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This world is a chaos; it has been put into disarray by the great politicians and by the so-called reformers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For a person to be a high officer or the head of a state will not necessarily bring blessing to humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if a man gains the whole world, what he ultimately gets is but a coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>None of these are the meaning of human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE PURPOSE OF MAN TO BE GOD'S VESSEL,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CONTAINING GOD AND EXPRESSING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man is God's vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is God's "bulb."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God wants to put His life and light into man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He wants to live inside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the meaning of your existence?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is it for your family, children, or business?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have attended school for many years, and you have filled your mind with knowledge, but is this the meaning of your human life?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people hope to have good children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But as their sons are growing up, the fathers themselves are dwindling down.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Other people say that they want to serve God and to keep His will; they want to please God, to work for Him, and to zealously do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are these thoughts correct?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Again there are those who hope to receive answers to prayers, to receive blessings, and to witness for God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christianity today has been degraded by man to a pitiful level.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To have blessings and peace is not the purpose of man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What then is the purpose of man?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 9:20 and 21 say that man is a piece of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This piece of clay is not made to be God's servant or His maid.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is made to be a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Any vessel, whether it is a cup or a bowl, exists for the purpose of containing something.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A vessel is different from a tool.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has no intention to make you into a tool.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It would be terrible if God were to make you into a tool.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He has no intention to make you into a hammer and use you to hit others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He only wants to put Himself into you, so that His life can flow out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The real way to serve God, glorify Him, and keep His will is to put yourself in the hand of God and to allow Him to fill you up.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way, God will shine out and flow out from within you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not a matter of your working for the Lord, but of God's working Himself into you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is a great blasphemy to think that a man can do anything for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He does not need you to work for Him; He only needs you to allow Him to work in you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Ephesians 2 says that we are God's workmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are not His workers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If the whole of Swatow would rise up to work, I can predict that soon these ones will argue one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But if here is a small group of people who would tell the Lord that they are not here to work for Him, but to be worked on by Him, God will have a way here.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God does not need you to be His tool.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He wants you to be His vessel to contain Him.</S>
