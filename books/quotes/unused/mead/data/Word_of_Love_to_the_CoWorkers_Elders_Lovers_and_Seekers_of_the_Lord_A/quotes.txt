[1]  CONTENT Corporate Living and the Need for Shepherding Shepherding People according to the Lord's Heart Beware of Four Negative Factors Be Right in Following Others
[2]  I thank the Lord that in the last few years, especially since 1991, about two years after we started the full-time training in Anaheim, the Lord has been blessing us in many ways for spreading and for revival.
[3]  One day a student came to D. L. Moody, the American evangelist who founded the Moody Bible Institute, saying, I dare not to go out to get people saved because I am afraid that someone may be saved whom God did not choose.
[4]  We must have a clear view about the way we practice the brothers and sisters homes.
[5]  For the homes we should keep the principle that we are a loving people.
[6]  In this message we will fellowship concerning how we should learn of the Lord to shepherd people according to His heart.
[7]  James ends his writing by saying, My brothers, if any one among you is led astray from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that one s soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins 5:19-20 .
[8]  If a brother is led astray from the truth to attend the denominations or go to the movies, our small group may feel that we do not need him, and we do not accept him because he is not qualified.
[9]  God so loved the world, sinful people in their worst denotation, that He gave His only begotten Son, not so that they would go to heaven but that whoever believes into Him would not perish but have eternal life.
[10]  First Timothy 1:15 says, Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost.
[11]  Christ Jesus came into the world, which, as we have seen, is not a positive term.
[12]  First John 4:10 says, Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.
[13]  First Corinthians 13:3 says, If I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing.
[14]  If we lose this spirit, whether we are elders, co-workers, or serving ones, we are finished.
[15]  This is the main reason why we are so barren, bearing no fruit for so many years.
[16]  Recently a brother went to care for a couple, but he did not have this spirit.
[17]  Then I will have to confess, Lord, even in the matter of the way I talked to my wife I was not conformed to Your death.
[18]  In a meeting I may speak with the Lord, but after I return home, I may be another person.
[19]  We should not say that we are the class of people who live with the Lord, walk with the Lord, and work with the Lord.
[20]  I do not prefer to have this kind of fellowship with you, but I must speak in this way for your sake in order to shepherd you.
[21]  Recently I have spoken concerning the Lord s discipling.
[22]  God wants us to be the God-men at the top of the heavenly ladder, but we may not even be on the first rung of the ladder.
[23]  Therefore, we need to be discipled to see how the Lord lived a divine life by putting His natural life aside.
[24]  Today I am more conformed to Christ s death than I have been in sixty years, but my conformation to His death is still not perfected; it is still going on, and I am still under the Lord s discipling.
[25]  Once he told the Lord that he would not deny Him as others would, but the Lord told him that Satan had asked to have him to sift him as wheat and that he would deny Him three times Luke 22:31-34 .
[26]  CHAPTER THREE BEWARE OF FOUR NEGATIVE FACTORS A CONCLUDING WORD
[27]  REGARDING THE FOREGOING MESSAGES We must have the loving and forgiving heart of our Father God.
[28]  We must also have the shepherding and seeking spirit of our Savior Christ, with the goal to gain people.
[29]  In this message I wish to fellowship with you some further crucial matters.
[30]  I do not mean to say that only you have these negative points and I do not.
[31]  This means that in your work in the Lord s recovery you have a party in which certain ones who are very close to you have been captivated, attracted, and charmed by you.
[32]  Later, after further consideration with the Lord, I felt that I had received a clear word and that it was the Lord s timing to respond.
[33]  You may not boast openly, but you may boast hiddenly of your spiritual capacity, ability, and capability.
[34]  I have learned this lesson, I have experienced all these things, and I have seen the situations.
[35]  Therefore, I do have a burden within me to speak to you all, and I feel that this is the time to speak a word of love concerning ambition, pride, self-justification, and not being conformed to the death of Christ.
[36]  Therefore, Paul charged us, saying, For I say, through the grace given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith Rom 12:3 .
[37]  Matthew 16:24 says, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. To not conform to the death of Christ is to not absolutely deny your self, not others self, and bear the cross.
[38]  Whether or not that was my sending, I do not know, but even if that was a sending, I did not send you to control others, to subdue others, with my name.
[39]  Dear saints, I know that you all love the Lord, and I know that you love the recovery.
[40]  Recently I heard certain ones complaining that they spend much labor to gain people, and they send them to the training for four terms at a great cost, but eventually the trainees do not come back.
[41]  CHAPTER FOUR BE RIGHT IN FOLLOWING OTHERS Be right in following others: Be careful in following any co-workers whom you appreciate and to whom you are attracted: He should be a person loving the Lord, living for the Lord, and renouncing his self, natural life, preference, and ambition.
[42]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your mercy and for Your grace.
[43]  Lord, we need Your forgiveness, Your washing away of all our dirt and defects with Your blood.
[44]  Lord, we can stand here before You not on our perfection but on the blood that overcomes the accuser.
[45]  Lord, come and fellowship with us, and grant us Your fellowship that we may have the freedom to fellowship with one another.
[46]  In these sixty-four years I have seen many things, I have gone through many things, I have experienced many things, and I have suffered quite much.
[47]  I went back to them, and I stayed in the home of a rich man, whose wife was very eloquent and active in loving the Lord, but eventually I realized that they were not the ones who could take this way.
[48]  We thank the Lord for this, but if you do not cooperate with the Lord to deal with ambition, pride, and self-justification, and if you are not conformed to the death of Christ, the outcome among us will be division.
[49]  Verses 10-12 say, Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.
[50]  Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
[51]  I do not like to hear that you appreciate me, that you feel I am right and you follow me.
[52]  If you appreciate the truths I have put out, I thank the Lord, but if you appreciate me, that is wrong.
[53]  Living for the Lord, and Renouncing His Self, Natural Life, Preference, and Ambition
[54]  Regardless of how good one is and how high his spiritual capacity might be, you must ask, Is this one to whom I have been attracted a person who all the time renounces his self, his natural life, his preference, and ambition?
[55]  However, even if you say that you are for the oneness of the Body, to not take the unique ground of the local church is strong evidence that you do not care for the oneness of the Body.
[56]  It did not speak of God s economy as a plan but of God s economy in our being concerning our spirit, our mind, our will, and our emotion.
[57]  The application of the divine truths must avoid uplifting any basic truths, such as the three sections of sanctification, the designation of Christ as the seed of David to be the firstborn Son of God, the acknowledgment of the fact that I am of Christ, etc., to cause divisions that divide Christ, including His Body 1 Cor 1:11-13a .
[58]  Since I came to this country in 1962, I have seen and experienced many things.
[59]  Because there are so many co-workers in this area, I feel burdened to speak this word of love as a warning to you.
[60]  I admit and I am bold to say that God brought me to Brother Nee.
[61]  At times in my speaking I was a little careless, but after my message was polished and I read it again, I changed some of the things which I had said.
[62]  The next summer I told the saints that our leading actually is not a person, neither I nor Brother Nee, but it is the Lord s revelation, the Lord s word.
