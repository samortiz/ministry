<h2 class="head2">The Coming Judgment</h2><p>Another way to preach the gospel is to speak about the coming judgment. In China, however, the thought of a coming judgment has been tainted with Taoist philosophy and the Buddhist religion. The Chinese mentality commonly considers that there are different gods for different religions. The Chinese speak of hell, but they regard it merely as a tool to scare people to do good. They do not consider hell as an actual future place. But the Bible tells us that it is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment (Heb. 9:27). Judgment is a definite fact. In preaching this kind of gospel, we can describe the actual condition of hell to men. We can plainly explain the different kinds of judgment in the different ages in the Bible, from the present Hades through the coming tribulation to the judgment at the great white throne and ultimately to the everlasting lake of fire. All these judgments have their order and place in the Bible.</p><p>We have to believe that the Holy Spirit will speak through us as we preach the gospel of judgment. We have to boldly declare that there is a coming judgment! Everyone will die, and after death there is judgment. We can speak on Revelation 20:11-15. There we see the last judgment of God at the great white throne when the unbelievers will be cast into the lake of fire. If possible, we can go on to chapter twenty-one and compare it to chapter twenty. This will stir up men's desire to escape judgment and to receive eternal life. The key to preaching is to believe that the Holy Spirit will speak to men as we speak. God has spoken. Therefore, we can speak. We do not have to be shy. This is also a very good way. Do not be afraid to preach about judgment or eternal punishment. Many people are saved through hearing about judgment. If we cooperate with the Holy Spirit, others will feel the need for salvation when they hear a word on judgment.</p><h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Human Life</h2><p>The meaning of human life is also a subject for the gospel. Some people think that human life is a riddle. They do not know the meaning of human life. Does man exist only for eating, drinking, and sleeping? Some ask this question. We can preach the gospel from this angle. We can tell others that a man lives a meaningless life if he only knows to eat, drink, and sleep. Man's existence is only meaningful after he knows God and knows God's intention in creating man. We have to tell him the biblical record of God's creation, man's fall, and God salvation for man. If a man does not have salvation, he does not have a center; he does not have meaning to his human life. God created the heavens, the earth, and man for Himself. He is the center of everything, and in particular, the center of man. If a man turns away from God, he becomes a mere eating and sleeping machine. Once a man has God, however, he has meaning and purpose to his human life. He will no longer feel the vanity of this life.</p><p>The above five subjects define man's greatest needs. Most people have these five needs. If we can preach these five kinds of gospel, we can meet the need of almost everyone. We have to learn how to present one of these five kinds of things to men, showing them their needs and showing them the way to satisfy their needs. We know these needs, but sinners do not. We should preach what we know to those who do not know.</p><p>The worst thing that a preacher can do is to speak about doctrines without creating a sense of need in others. Reason cannot bring a man to tears. Doctrines cannot prick man's heart. Philosophy cannot kindle the fire within man. Excitement cannot save him. Only creating a sense of need will cause man to readily receive the gospel. It matters little whether or not doctrines are preached well. We should be satisfied as long as men are saved. The thought of giving a good message is a great temptation to a gospel preacher. A doctor does not need to learn to prescribe nice medicine; he needs to heal patients. The greatest mistake that we can commit is to preach a good message for the sake of saving our face, while men's souls remain unsaved.</p>
