   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Eph 3:9-11; Matt 16:18; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Acts 15:2, 6, 22-23, 28; 1 Tim 3:1-7; 5:17; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that in this dark age You are bringing us into the light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While people are busy toiling in the world, You have separated us, even rescued us, from the world and put us into Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, although our gathering is on earth, we sense that we are in the heavens, because the heavens are open to us and are even with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, You are with us in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We believe that You will speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We ask You to unveil us to see Your mystery, which has been hidden throughout the ages and is still hidden to many today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unveil us that we may see Your heart s desire and know Your eternal will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>O Lord, we also ask You to reveal to us in detail the plan, the economy, that You have had from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also ask that You would operate in our hearts accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>O Lord, may You cause each one of us to gain You, to gain Your good pleasure, and to gain the desire of Your heart so that we may be one spirit with You and even one heart and one entity with You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, we are Your many members, and You are our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know that You have an intention for gathering us together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We treasure this time and know that You will fulfill Your desire and accomplish Your eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, give us Your word, light, and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Shine on us and expose our true condition so that we may see You and see ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Make our heart firm and do not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Remove all our wickedness and all our shadows so that our inner being may be single and pure toward You.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May our sky be clear, and may our mind and intention be upright and be a straight way through which You may freely pass.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, may we gain Your praise as those who are sincere, without any crookedness or guile.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In these few days make clear to us the words in Your heart and infuse us with Your intention, feeling, thought, and even utterance so that we may be one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fellowship with us in our fellowship, and speak to us in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Confirm the fact that You are one spirit with us, vindicate Your way, and in every aspect put Your enemy to shame on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>O Lord, may Your riches and preservation be with Your church so that You may gain the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We pray for the tens of thousands of brothers and sisters on the island of Taiwan; we entrust them to You, commit them into Your hands, and ask You to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May every saint be revived and strengthened inwardly, live an overcoming life, bear a good testimony for You, manifest his function in Your Body, and be building material in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We pray for them and also for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, You are the One who walks in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our trust is in You; You are our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, You are our blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that we are depends on You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May You be everything in our midst and be the preeminent One in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May You gain the desire of Your heart, and may we obtain satisfaction in You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By the Lord s mercy we have been speaking concerning the new way for over three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this period of time we have carried out many studies and experiments.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through these, we believe that we have arrived at a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have experimented in every stage and step related to the practice of the new way, the way that is ordained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We feel that now is the time for us to fellowship with all the churches regarding our various experiments.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We hope that, by the Lord s grace, through our discussion and review all the churches will accept the results that we have obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE IMPORTANCE OF ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>IN GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All those serving the Lord, whether full-timers, elders, or co-workers, need to be clear regarding one matter: According to the revelation of the New Testament, there is a very crucial group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These people are the elders within a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the New Testament the elders, as a group, are crucial in regard to the carrying out of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who read the Bible usually pay much attention to the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Similarly, in Christianity most people realize that there is a need for apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, but few are aware of the importance of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before we were saved and even after we were saved and entered into the church life, we may have never dreamed that in God s New Testament economy there is still a need for elders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The carrying out of God s New Testament economy in a particular place depends entirely upon the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This can be likened to the carrying out of the decree of a government.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether such a decree can be carried out without hindrance depends almost entirely upon the local administration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the local administration does not cooperate or has problems and difficulties in regard to the carrying out of the government s decree, the government will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regardless of how strong, good, capable, righteous, and proper the government is, if the decrees of that government cannot be carried out at the level of the local administration, all its efforts will be annulled and made void.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if the failure to carry out the decree is unintentional and is due to the incapability and incompetence of the local administration, the result of the decree will still equal zero.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Similarly, the position of the elders in God s New Testament economy is exceedingly important.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible reveals that the elders as a group are indispensable in the church life, and our experience also confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the elders are weak, the church is weak, and when the elders are strong, the church is also strong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Likewise, if the elders are spiritually rich, the church is spiritually rich; and if they are spiritually poor, the church is also spiritually poor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, whether the tide of the church is high or low depends solely upon the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the condition of the elders is high, the church will be high; if the condition of the elders is low, the church will be low.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The condition of the elders is reflected in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This principle is ironclad.</S>
