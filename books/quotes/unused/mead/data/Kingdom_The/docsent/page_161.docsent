   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the kingdom of God is simply another term for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To seek the kingdom means to seek Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the book of Philippians we do not have such a term as the kingdom, but we do find a synonymous term Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To seek the kingdom first actually means to seek Christ first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, we should not seek Christ in a superficial or general way, but in the way of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the kingdom life?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the very beginning of the Bible we see that with God's kingdom there are two aspects image and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God created man in His own image and gave man dominion over all things Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to see that image relates to the expression of God and dominion relates to the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order for us to express God's image, we need God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With Christ we have both the image of God and the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we mean business with Christ, He will be our expression and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we have Christ, we have the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we seek Christ first, God will take care of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not a matter of giving up things and losing things; it is a matter of taking up Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>People may ask us why we do not practice certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The best answer is to tell them we do not have time for such things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are fully occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Also, we do not have any room.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not have the space for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As far as time and space are concerned, we are fully occupied with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This should be our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As children of the kingdom, we should be pure in all of our good deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our attitude toward mammon, or riches, is that we do not serve it as we serve God, and that we do not put our trust in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our trust is in our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He takes care of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to concern ourselves with His kingdom and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both the kingdom and the righteousness are Christ Himself in a very experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By Christ we are right with God, and we are right with others according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to experience Christ as our practical righteousness in being right with God and right with others according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is Christ expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the kingdom and Christ is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we seek Christ as the kingdom and as righteousness, our Father in heaven will take care of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever we need will be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reality of the kingdom life.</S>
