   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRUCIFIED, BURIED, AND RESURRECTED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since we were put into Christ before the foundation of the world, we were also in Him when He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When He went to the cross, He went there with us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He died on the cross with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason Paul could say, I have been crucified with Christ Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to have Paul s view of Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just as we were crucified with Christ, we were also buried and resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He was buried in Mark 15, we were buried also.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, when He was resurrected in Mark 16, we were resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Gospel of Mark is mainly a revelation of Christ s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although this Gospel does not say anything about His birth, it does emphasize His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the emphasis in Mark s Gospel is on the Person of Christ with His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need the fourteen Epistles of Paul to give the adequate definition of Christ s Person and of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By now we all should have a clear view of the Lord Jesus as the One who lived a life of sowing the Triune God into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the soil collected by Him, the disciples were in a condition portrayed by the different cases in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that they were sick with a fever, contaminated, and paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But they were all healed both in a general way and in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their organs of seeing, hearing, and speaking, in particular, were healed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the Lord called the disciples, He brought them with Him wherever He went.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As He was bringing the soil of the disciples with Him, He was sowing Himself into the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE REPRODUCTION OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The book of Acts is the direct continuation of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the first two chapters of Acts we see that Peter and the one hundred twenty had become the reproduction of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Mark the disciples were disputing concerning who was greater.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Also in Mark 14 Peter denied the Lord Jesus three times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in Acts 1 no one cared about who was greater.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, they prayed continually in one accord for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How could the disciples experience such a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They could experience this only by having the resurrected Christ in them as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the second chapter of Acts, the power from on high came upon the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, they became the increase, development, enlargement, and continuation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He had brought them through His death and His resurrection, and He had wrought Himself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result, they were replaced by the Lord and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way they became His increase and continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What kind of life did the one hundred twenty live in the book of Acts?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They lived a life that was fully according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They did not live a life of culture or religion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Neither did they live a life of ethics, morality, philosophy, or improvement of character.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as the Lord Jesus lived absolutely according to and for God s New Testament economy, so the one hundred twenty in Acts lived the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Acts 21 and in the book of James, however, we see a contrast to the life that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Acts 21 James was a distraction to the life that is fully according to the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In James we see a life that is only partially according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mainly with James we see a life that is according to the Old Testament, a life according to religion and ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>WHAT GOD DESIRES TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not our burden in these messages to study the Scriptures in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our burden is to present what God desires today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God wants us to be saturated by Him and with Him so that we may live a life of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we shall sow this life into others for the further dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Concerning this, we all need a revolution in our concept and living so that we may be brought into a life that is according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
