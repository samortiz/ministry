   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having the Reality of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Experiencing It</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Body is not a doctrine, but a spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a spiritual matter is recovered, and it is real, it will surely be felt by others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was the case with the release of the kingdom truth by Evan Roberts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was sick for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later he began to realize the truth concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he stood up to speak, the message may have been only fifteen minutes long, but there was something real in what he said.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before him, there were people who had spoken about the truth of the kingdom, but the reality was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same is true today with regard to the truth concerning the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people are able to speak about the Body, but they do not have the Body itself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before Darby, many people preached this truth, but they did not have the thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Darby came, it was different; not only did he speak about the truth, but he presented before men the real thing itself that is conveyed by the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A Believer Dropping What He Is Holding,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Experiencing What</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He Has Received Positionally</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Does this mean that God is restricted by man?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God wants to work, He will not be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a Christian receives on the day of salvation is the most that he will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What happens afterwards is that these riches are gradually lost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why are they lost?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is because along the pathway of being a Christian, such a one picks up many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both his hands are full, and he has no more capacity to receive anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the case with an individual, but the same is true with the church as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The book of Ephesians describes the height of the attainment of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After that, things began to fall below that standard.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a believer has received initially is something positional only.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Afterwards, he begins to receive something experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, in order for him to receive something experiential, he must first drop some other things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must drop what we have in our hands before we can gain something more in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we leave this world one day, we will be able to say that all our losses are actually gains.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today, a believer must catch up with God's work and must go on with Him, and he should not be one who is falling back.</S>
