   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AS THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>FOR HIS RULE OVER THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When God created the universe, He ordained authority as the governing principle for His rule over it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He alone is the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is also the origin of all authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some archangels were under Him, and under these archangels were many other angels.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The record in Jeremiah and Isaiah shows us that there were other living creatures on earth during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was God's original order of administration over the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only was man upheld by His authority, but even the stars in the universe, including the earth and all the living creatures, were upheld by His authority.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What happened after God's creation?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know that the previous world became fallen when Satan, the archangel appointed by God, tried to exalt himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said in his heart, "I will ascend to heaven;/...I will exalt my throne./...I will be like the Most High" Isa 14:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan's rebellion was not against other things but against authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wanted to be equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He wanted to exalt himself to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not think that being the lord over everything under God was enough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He rebelled against God's authority and tried to usurp His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result, the morning star became Satan; the angel of light became the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This happened before the creation of man.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's Ordination for Man</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God placed man in the garden of Eden after his creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He arranged everything and appointed authorities in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He created man first, and then the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He created the husband first, and then the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's intention was for Eve to submit to Adam and for Adam to submit to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this arrangement He laid the foundation for children to obey their parents, slaves to obey their masters, and citizens to obey their rulers and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God arranged things in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He established authority in the universe.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan's Temptation and Corruption</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then Satan came in and tempted man in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through temptation Satan induced man not only to sin but also to overthrow God's appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God ordained for the woman to obey the man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But in the garden of Eden the man followed the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God appointed Adam to be the head, but in the garden of Eden, Eve took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She taught and made decisions and suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The rest of mankind was not yet born; only Adam and Eve were there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only rule was that the woman should submit to the man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The wife should submit to the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But this unique arrangement was immediately broken because of Satan.</S>
