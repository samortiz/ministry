   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Those who arranged the Psalms arranged them according to their contents.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this arrangement we have Psalms 1 through 119, which speak about the law; Psalms 120 through 134, which are psalms about the going up, the ascending, to Zion; and the last sixteen psalms, Psalms 135 through 150.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 135, a hallelujah psalm, stands alone, whereas Psalms 146 through 150, five other hallelujah psalms, are grouped together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Psalms 136 through 145 there is nothing crucial, nothing of particular importance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When some hear this, they may wonder about Psalm 137 and ask, "Are not the remembrance of Zion and the non-forgetting of Zion crucial?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning the captivity these may be crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, concerning God's economy these things are not crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matters such as weeping and hanging harps on the willows have nothing to do with God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, our saying that there is nothing crucial in these psalms is based on the principle of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The title of this message on Psalms 135 through 139 is "The Expressions of the Saints before Jehovah in Different Directions."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is particular about these psalms is actually not the saints' expressions but the fact that the writers were people who were very close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, these psalms are the expressions of the sentiments of writers who were very close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These sentiments are expressed from different directions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, Psalm 137 was written from the direction of one sitting by the rivers of Babylon, whereas Psalm 139 was written from the direction of God's searching and trying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 139:23-24 David prayed, "Search me, O God, and know my heart; / Try me, and know my anxious thoughts; /And see if there is some harmful way in me, /And lead me on the eternal way."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a prayer can be uttered only by a person who is very close to God, even face to face with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psalms 135 through 139 were written from different directions to express before God the sentiments of the psalmists.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In these psalms there is nothing crucial related to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, these psalms reveal that the writers were very close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to keep this point in mind as we consider each of these five psalms.</S>
