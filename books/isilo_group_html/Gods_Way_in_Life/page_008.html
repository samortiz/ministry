Romans 15:16 says that the Gentiles are sanctified and made acceptable in the Holy Spirit. First Corinthians 6:11 also says that we are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. If we call on the name of the Lord all the time and contact Him, God&#8217;s Spirit of life will not only sanctify us positionally, but dispositionally, so that our words and our walk can be separated unto God.<h2 class=head2>For Us to Be Transformed into Christ</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; We begin every day with an unveiled face, looking to the Lord and calling on His name. His Spirit will then operate within us and will mingle God&#8217;s life and nature with us, with the result that we will be transformed into His glorious image.<h2 class=head2>For Us to Live Out Christ as Our Virtues</h2><p>Philippians 1:19 tells us that within us we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This Spirit is simply Christ Himself as the Spirit of life within us. He is all-inclusive. Within Him is the rich element of divinity, the noble element of humanity, the proper, excellent human living, and the elements of death, resurrection, and ascension. Now, this Spirit is within us. He is the bountiful supply that enables us to be saved under all circumstances. This Spirit of life with the bountiful supply is our way unto salvation. In the end, we will be able to live out Christ as our virtues. These virtues are described in Philippians 4:8 as &#8220;what things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of.&#8217;&#8217; This kind of life is full of virtues and is worthy of praise.<p>Paul learned the secret concerning the attainment of all these things. He said that &#8220;in everything and in all things I have learned the secret&#8217;&#8217; (Phil. 4:12). This secret is what he described in the following verse: &#8220;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me&#8217;&#8217; (v. 13). He continually allowed Christ to be life in him and to live Himself out in his living. The Lord empowered him and enabled him to do all things. This is to live Christ and to magnify Him. &#8220;Even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death. For to me, to live is Christ&#8217;&#8217; (1:20b-21a).<p>Hence, Christ as the Spirit of life is in us as our life to be our way. By this way, we can live a spiritual living and can have the righteous requirement of the law fulfilled in us, so that we can become sanctified positionally and dispositionally, and we will be transformed into the image of Christ to live out His virtues.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California, on January 27, 1990)<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Way in Life &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
