   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LETTING GO AND LETTING EVERYONE FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Education begins in elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a person continues year after year, he will graduate from college or even finish with a Ph.D. Many saints have not had their function developed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They can be likened to someone who has been studying for many years and yet has not graduated from elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The co-workers and elders consider the saints and feel that no one is capable; therefore, they do everything themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more they do, the more experienced and skillful they become until they are the experts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The co-workers and elders are the only ones who know how to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we need to let go and let the saints serve so that they have the opportunity to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church in Los Angeles is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whether in meal service or giving hospitality, the saints take care of everything without being instructed by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even if the saints make a mistake, it will not be serious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some co-workers said, Those dissenting co-workers were raised up by Brother Lee s work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If Brother Lee had been more careful, these things would not have happened.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if from the beginning of the work in Taiwan, I did not let the brothers serve, I would have annulled the function of many saints, and the churches would not have had much increase.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I can be likened to a mother who had twenty-eight children, and although some have died, many remain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are still many local churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, let the saints make mistakes; the mistakes will not be too serious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need the Lord s mercy in order to be open to this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who is without mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Which one of us always does things right and never makes a mistake?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only the Lord Jesus is without mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May He have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we begin to serve in this way, some saints may oppose us, but we should not stop out of a desire to avoid making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not good if we cannot accommodate others or coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather than giving directions to others, we should concentrate on leading people to salvation and to loving the Lord for the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if a brother does not follow this fellowship, this is not a cause for stirring up trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The opposers shouted slogans, saying that they had seen Christ and that Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they truly had worked in the principle of Christ is everything, there would have been no need for slogans.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything else is trivial.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, they focused only on trivial things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should be strong in spirit, follow the leading of the Spirit, and have a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have always worked together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There has never been the feeling that some co-workers belong to this region of the work, and others belong to another region of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, our vision must be clear, our heart must be pure, and we must release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a co-worker wants to serve in a university where there are no saints, he should pray earnestly until there is at least one student there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there are already several saints on campus, he should find them, fellowship with them, and bring them into function.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then he should let them serve.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he leads their meeting, he is replacing, not leading, them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He should supply and teach them from a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To use a military example, he should supply them with ammunition, teach them how to shoot, and identify a strategic plan for them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It may appear to others that the students are the ones engaged in battle and that the co-worker is doing nothing, but the work has become the burden of the students.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some co-workers said that they are not able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Being able or not being able is a relative matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even a person who cannot speak well does not refuse to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone, whether smart or foolish, can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It does not matter whether a person speaks well or speaks poorly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A person who speaks well accomplishes something, and a person who speaks poorly also accomplishes something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the way that things are accomplished in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only when we change our concept and disposition will the work have a future.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From now on the affairs of the church should be turned over to the saints; the affairs of the church should be under their care.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The co-workers must not replace the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are many saints in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The co-workers must not give the saints directions but rather entrust them with responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The co-workers and elders should just oversee the services, rendering appropriate adjustment and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, the co-workers in every place should bear the responsibility of ministering the word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They should not minister doctrine but should make an effort to use appropriate material and learn to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If one co-worker is unable to do this, two or three can come together in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They can dive into a message and study how to digest it so that they can supply the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every week the co-workers should have a rich word with which to supply the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The full-time co-workers should do their best to propagate the work in schools.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no need to wait for others to make arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They should spend more time with the schools and not with the church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The co-workers should do their best to supply the students without leading the students meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The meetings of the church are the meetings of the saints; hence, the elders and co-workers should not lead the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They should help the saints understand that the meetings belong to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The elders are responsible for oversight, making sure that the meetings are carried out properly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They should teach and correct if anything is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The co-workers should endeavor to minister the word and supply life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The elders should also endeavor to utilize more of their time for shepherding and less time for church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since the affairs of the church have been handed over to the saints, the elders should let the saints be responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These are the main points that we should grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must not fall back to our old ways of keeping everything in our hands and doing everything ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The elders should take care of shepherding and deal only with crucial matters, leaving the ordinary affairs to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The church meetings should also be handed over to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The co-workers should endeavor to supply the word.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If they have more time, they should endeavor to propagate the gospel in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After the services are handed over to the saints, the elders should oversee diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The elders should turn over the responsibility of a certain service to two or three saints who can train and instruct other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The elders do not have to be concerned with these details.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The elders need only to oversee and observe.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When there is a mistake or an act of negligence in the service, the elders should render appropriate help.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Furthermore, we should not be rigid in forming small groups by assigning someone to be responsible or someone to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, we should let the saints serve voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should let the saints endeavor to look for backslidden saints and to preach the gospel and bring in new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The elders should not lead in the bread-breaking meeting or the young people s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The elders should let the saints lead the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The elders need only to oversee from a distance and render appropriate correction, guidance, and encouragement when needed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is different from what we have done with small groups in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the past, based on the information cards, we formed the saints into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As a result, only a few saints met together; most never attended the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This time the saints who sign up will be formed into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The saints who sign up later will be formed into more groups.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The co-workers and elders must see the urgent need of shepherding, growing in life, and supplying the word.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>These are the three items that we lack the most.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must lead the churches into shepherding, growing in life, and the supply of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We want a living word, not routine messages.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In every church there should be one to two meetings a week with a living word.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>As long as the co-workers are willing to endeavor, they will be able to meet this need.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>They must not carry out a routine.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Concerning the church services, all the affairs in the churches should be taken care of by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Not only should the saints do things, but they should take up the burden and the responsibility for the things that they do.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The meetings belong to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The co-workers and elders are present to render a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Even the spiritual services belong to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Eventually, every saint will learn to shepherd and to teach.</S>
