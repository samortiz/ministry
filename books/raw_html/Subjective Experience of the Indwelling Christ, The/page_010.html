<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:16-20, 23; 15:4a; Rom. 8:9-11; Eph. 3:16-17</h1><p>Prayer: O Lord, we worship You because You are our God, our Creator, and our Redeemer. Lord, we come together to Your word before You reverently. May You anoint us richly with Your Spirit and move within each one to shine forth the light of Your word, so that while we are reading, we may see the light and revelation and receive the supply of the Holy Spirit.<p>Lord, we thank and praise You from deep within, because You died and resurrected for us and have become the life-giving Spirit, who not only is in heaven but also dwells in our spirit. Lord Jesus, we look to You from the depths of our being, expecting You to impart more of Yourself to us again and transfuse Yourself into us through Your words, which are spirit and are life. O Lord, we come here not only to hear Your words, but even more to receive Yourself, because Your very self is in Your words. Your words entering into us are just Yourself entering into us. Lord, may You open our mind, enlighten the eyes of our heart, and remove all our veils. May You sprinkle Your precious blood upon us once again to cleanse us so that because of this blood we may have a pure conscience and be at peace before You without any barrier or fear. Lord, it is such a glory and a blessing that we are able to contact You and have fellowship with You. May You give us a comforting word, a solid word, an encouraging word, a healing word, and a life-supplying word. Lord, every one of us has a need. You are the all-sufficient Lord. May You give us a sentence, or even just a few words, to meet each one’s need. We really look to You to give us a living word.<p>Lord, we ask You to destroy Your enemy, who often troubles us. Destroy his power of darkness and even destroy his strongholds in our mind. We pray that You would eliminate any lukewarmness or hesitation within us so that our whole heart may incline toward You.<p>Lord, today is the morning of Your resurrection and the day of our salvation. May You gain us and gain more ground in each one of us. Lord, operate more and more among us that, with our spirits uplifted and burning, we may thank You, praise You, and worship You together. Your name is a victorious name. In this name we pray, and by this name we bind the strong man and plunder his house. May You gain all the glory this morning, and may Your enemy be put to shame. Amen!<h2 class=head1>THE LORD JESUS AS THE COMFORTER OUTSIDE HIS DISCIPLES WHILE HE WAS ON EARTH</h2><p>In John 14:16 the Lord Jesus said, “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter.” The Greek word for Comforter is difficult to translate because it is a very particular word; its anglicized form is paraclete. The word refers to one who is called to your side to wait on you, to take care of you, and to bear all your responsibilities. If you are sick, he is both the doctor and the nurse to take care of you. If you have a legal case, he is the lawyer to help you handle the case and go to court to represent you in the lawsuit. Moreover, if you encounter any problem in your daily life, he is your counselor. He can solve your problem, and you can pour out your heart to him and enjoy his kind protection. This Greek word implies a great deal. First John 2:1 says, “We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.” This Advocate is our Comforter. The Greek word for Advocate is the same as that for Comforter; the two titles refer to the same One.<p>Originally, the Lord Jesus was God over all and the Creator of the universe (Rom. 9:5; John 1:3). One day He humbled Himself to become a man by being conceived and born of a virgin in a manger. He lived in the despised city of Nazareth and grew up in a poor carpenter’s home. When He was thirty years old, He went out to preach the word, heal the sick, cast out demons, perform signs and wonders, and teach the truth. He was with His disciples for three and a half years and was very thoughtful of them. He knew their problems and was able to meet all their needs. Parents love their children, yet often they are unable to render any help to their children when their children have problems. The Lord Jesus, however, was not only kind and thoughtful but also omniscient and omnipotent. He lived, walked, ate, and drank with His disciples. He solved all their problems and ministered to all their needs. He was not only their Doctor and Nurse but also their Lawyer and Counselor. He was truly their Comforter.
