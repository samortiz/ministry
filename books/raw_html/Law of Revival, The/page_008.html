        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">REVIVAL BEING A LAW OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE</h2>
<p>After studying the biographies of many spiritual men and the revivals that we have experienced in the past, we have come to the conclusion that revival is a law of the spiritual life.</p>
<p>Every organism has its own laws. Biology is the study of the laws of various organisms, including the phenomena and the issue of the operation of these laws. Our spiritual life also has many laws. For example, Romans 8:2 speaks of &ldquo;the law of the Spirit of life,&rdquo; and Hebrews 8:10 speaks of the laws that God will inscribe on our hearts. There is another law of the spiritual life related to revival. Although I have observed revivals and also experienced revivals, I never considered that revival is a law. Therefore, I have not given any messages concerning the law of revival.</p>
<p>In Christianity the word <em>revival</em> is often used in the context of a spiritual reawakening. This understanding is applied to a Christian who becomes cold, stumbles, goes back to the world, or falls into sin, but if he later rises up again to love and pursue the Lord, he has experienced a reawakening, a revival. This, however, is not what the Bible reveals as a revival in the normal experience of a Christian. It is true that a person who stumbles, becomes cold, or backslides needs to be revived. However, even if a person does not stumble, become cold, or backslide, he still needs a revival, because being revived is a law of the spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVIVAL BEING THE METABOLISM<br />
OF OUR SPIRITUAL LIFE</h2>
<p>The revivals in our spiritual life have the same function as the metabolism of an animal or a plant. In both the animal life and the plant life there is a metabolic function. The ability of an organism to grow and mature depends on the law of metabolism. If the metabolic function stops, the growth of life will also stop. The continual growth of a tree also depends on the seasonal cycles of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Under normal conditions a tree needs metabolic processes in order to grow well.</p>
<p>This principle applies also to our human life, which is the highest form of the created life. Medical doctors know that every cell in the human body is completely renewed about every seven years. This renewing requires that the metabolic functions in our body operate daily; that is, new nutrients must be absorbed to supply us, and old nutrients must be discharged. The old nutrients are discharged and replaced by the new nutrients. This is metabolism. Our body grows and becomes strong through this process, which is a law of the human life.</p>
<p>If we compare what the Bible says concerning revival with the experiences of believers, we can see that the spiritual life also includes a &ldquo;metabolic&rdquo; process. This process is a cycle that is repeated continuously. In our spiritual experience there is a beginning, a course, and an ending, after which we experience another beginning with another course and another ending. This cycle repeats itself, and each repetition takes us forward. The beginning, course, and ending are a spiritual metabolism. This is also a law of revival. Every new beginning is a new revival and is followed by a course. When the course reaches its fullness, the experiences in that stage come to an end. Then another beginning will ensue with another course and another ending. This is the cycle of revival.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE LAW</h2>
<p>If we know the law, or secret, to doing something, we will have the assurance of doing it well. Revivals are not an exception. If we understand the law of revival and touch the secret to revivals, it will be easy for us to experience a revival. For example, the people in a village in northern China contracted night blindness. Later it was discovered that if they ate the liver of a certain fish, known locally as flatfish, their eyesight would be restored. From that time onward, those who were diagnosed with this disease were healed by eating the flatfish liver. Studies have shown that night blindness is due to the shortage of vitamin A in the body and that the flatfish liver is rich in vitamin A; hence, it was possible to cure the disease. This is an example of a law. As soon as this law was discovered, it was easy to cure the disease. Those who had the disease did not need to worry or fear. As long as they applied the law, they would be healed. Once a law is discovered, it is possible for help to be rendered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF NOT KNOWING THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Some saints have spiritual &ldquo;night blindness.&rdquo; They are always in anguish and feel oppressed. They long to rise up, but they are unable because they have not touched the law that can cure their disease. For the last ten years we have given messages concerning the aspects of our spiritual life, but we missed the matter of revival, the law of revival. Without this teaching we have suffered much and sustained much loss. We suffer, feel oppressed, and are not released, because we neither know the law of revival, nor do we know how to apply this law.</p>
<p>Several years ago many saints entered into the pause after the end of a revival and began to feel oppressed, weak, and in darkness. When they examined their situation, however, they realized that they had not stumbled and that they were stronger in the Lord. Nevertheless, they did not sense the same sweetness, freshness, or vitality. These saints remained in this condition for more than five years and could not find a way to be released. They suffered because we had not discovered the law of revival. Even though some saints were refreshed occasionally and could rise up when they touched the Lord, the help that they received was general.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MORE REVIVALS RESULTING IN FASTER GROWTH</h2>
<p>After the end of a revival it is not necessary to experience a pause for a prolonged period of time. According to the law in our spiritual life, every revival has a course, after which there is a sense of being unsatisfied. This prepares us for a new revival. Hence, we should not feel weak and oppressed for a long time. We must remember that such feelings indicate that another revival will come. Furthermore, such feelings indicate that we need a new supply. This new supply is a revival. This is according to the law of revival.</p>
<p>Genuine growth in life is gained in the cycle of being revived, feeling unsatisfied for a period of time after the end of a revival, and then being revived again. This is also the way for our spiritual stature to increase. No matter how thorough a revival may be, it is not possible to gain every spiritual experience and become full grown in one revival. We must experience many revivals in our spiritual journey. This is the way for us to receive a fresh spiritual supply and to grow in the spiritual life. Those who do not pass through many spiritual cycles will grow slowly and will not gain much stature. In contrast, those who pass through this process many times will grow quickly and will mature.</p>
<p>In the physical realm a person needs to exercise in order to accelerate his metabolism. A person with a fast metabolism will experience proper growth and will be strong. This principle can be applied to our spiritual life. A person who passes through more cycles of being revived will grow fast. Regrettably, many saints have been in an oppressed situation for up to six years, and they have not experienced a new cycle of revival. Hence, their spiritual life is stagnant; they do not have much growth, nor are they learning new lessons. We could say that they have learned to be patient, but this may not be a genuine lesson, because even an unbeliever who is in a difficult situation for up to six years can learn to be patient without being spiritually experienced. Some saints have indeed made progress in their conduct, in the way they take care of matters, in their temperament, and in their habits. However, such progress might not be spiritual growth; it is possible that it is merely the outcome of being tried under difficult circumstances. There is a big difference between this experience and spiritual progress.</p>
<p>Genuine spiritual growth depends on the renewing of the inner life. This renewing in life is a revival. When we experience a revival, we will know and receive more spiritual things. After a period of time, what we know and have received will become old, and we will feel unsatisfied and weak. This means that it is time for us to be revived again in order to see and gain something new, that is, for the spiritual element to increase in us and for our spiritual stature to increase. Thus, another cycle will ensue, after which we will again become old and unsatisfied. Hence, we are renewed, become old, and are renewed again. Through this process we receive more spiritual elements. The new spiritual elements eliminate and swallow up some of the old elements in us. The more we are revived, the more spiritual elements will be added to us, and the more our natural elements will be swallowed up. The element of the self is discharged, and the element of God is added to us; we decrease, and the Lord increases. It is only through such a cycle of revival that we can grow.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
