        <h2 class="head1">BEARING THE PROBLEMS OF THE SAINTS<br />
BY GROWING UP INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>The elders must learn to bear the problems of the saints. Sometimes our shepherding of the saints causes us much trouble, and sometimes we need to help the saints who are in trouble. The only way to bear such situations is to grow up into Christ. Some saints love the church and are righteous, always doing things in a righteous way. When such a saint sees an elder doing things in an inappropriate way, he may deliberately make things difficult for the elder. The only way to handle such a situation is to pray and ask the Lord to open a way. This is what it means to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things (cf. Eph. 4:15). We should not blame the saints for being troublesome, nor should we play tricks or use politics to solve the problems. This is to use methods that are outside of Christ. We need to bring every problem before the Lord. When we go to the Lord, we will experience the growth in life.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother seeks advice because his wife is a burden to him. When the brother consults us regarding his wife, we should not set him aside by saying, &ldquo;Brother, bear the cross! Romans 8:28 says that all things work together for good to those who love God.&rdquo; Such clich&#233;s are ineffective. The elders are shepherds. When sheep are in trouble, the shepherds are like parents with children; we cannot throw Romans 8:28 at them. When a child cannot find a way out, the parents need to take responsibility. When the saints do not know how to go on, the elders need to take responsibility. Therefore, when a brother tells us his problems, we should bear the responsibility and say, &ldquo;Brother, let us pray together. I will pray for you, and you should pray too. Let us ask the Lord to lead us.&rdquo; We should bring the burden to the Lord. We may say, &ldquo;Lord, You saved this brother and his wife, but they cannot get along. Lord, how should I help him from the perspective of life?&rdquo; When we pray, we are the first person to learn the lesson. We will realize that we do not treat our spouse in a proper way. The brother&rsquo;s problem exposes our problem. Then we will learn the lesson before the Lord and be dealt with by the Lord. After this we should pray with the brother again, and we will minister to him what we have learned, and he will be supplied. As a result, the Body will grow. The elders take the lead to grow, and the saints follow the elders to grow. This principle applies to dealing with the problems of the saints. We cannot use doctrines to set people aside. We must bear the problems of the saints and regard their problems as our own problems by bringing their problems to the Lord and seeking the Lord&rsquo;s way in prayer.</p>
<p>If the elders administrate the church and lead and care for people in life, the saints will grow in life. The elders will grow in life, and the saints will receive the life supply and grow in life. The whole church will grow together under such leadership of the elders. On the one hand, the elders will bring the saints into serving, and on the other hand, the elders will bring the saints&rsquo; problems before the Lord in prayer. Through such prayer the elders will obtain the experiences of life and will be able to help the saints grow. If this is our practice, after a few years every aspect of the church will be glorious. At present every locality lacks such building. If we have such building in the local churches, we will not need any gifts or eloquent speakers, nor will we need special conferences. The divine life will grow spontaneously.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS CHANGING THEIR WAYS</h2>
<p>Regrettably, our present situation has not changed, because the elders use natural ways to administrate the church. The elders hold everything related to service in their hands and do not trust others. As a result, the saints love the church but have no part in the service. The problem lies with the elders. If the elders will change, the church will have no problem. The elders need to trust the saints. The saints may initially make a mess of things, but eventually they will learn the lessons of life. The saints who are set aside and not brought into serving will complain and murmur. Such saints do not give up on the church, but the elders have set them aside. The saints who have problems should learn the lessons of life, but they will not know how to advance if the elders do not take the lead to learn the lessons of life. As a result, the church will not advance. If a senior co-worker is invited to give a conference every six months, there will only be excitement. After the co-worker leaves, the church will return to its original state.</p>
<p>We need to change our way of doing things. If the elders do not change, we have no way out. It is not impossible for us to change our ways. We must hold on to two points. First, we must not set any saint aside; even the ones who seem useless are useful. We should gradually bring every saint into serving. If the saints are functioning, they will find their home in the church and be happy. Second, we should consider every saint&rsquo;s problem as our own problem, just as parents consider their children&rsquo;s problems to be their problems. We should relate to the saints in this way, pray and inquire of the Lord concerning their problems, fellowship with the Lord, and be willing to be dealt with and enlightened. Then we will learn the lessons, and we will see a reflection of ourselves in their problems. Through the problems of the saints, we will understand our own problems.</p>
<p>If the elders take the lead to learn the lessons and to be dealt with by the Lord, the saints will follow to be dealt with and corrected by the Lord, which will result in the growth of life and the building. This is &ldquo;all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part&rdquo; (Eph. 4:16). If each one part functions, the Body will be knit together in a strong way, which will cause the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. I believe that we are able to experience this.</p>
<p>When I say that we do not need many conferences, I do not mean that we do not need the supply from the ministry. The church needs the supply. However, the conferences are merely a supply. The building up of the church depends on the elders perfecting the saints and helping the saints grow in life. Therefore, I hope that the elders in every locality will change their ways.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
