   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH NEEDING A GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church must have a ground.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What do we mean by the ground?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ground is where something is placed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This podium needs to be placed somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That place is the ground of the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Similarly, the church, being something so great in the universe, needs a definite place, a site where it can be placed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is real, concrete, great, and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order for the church to be expressed in the universe, it must be on a site; this site is its ground.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without a ground, speaking of the church is vanity because there is no way for the church to be displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order for the church to be displayed, there must be a ground.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a principle, a law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible says that the church is a house built by God as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to build a house, there must be a base.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This base is the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must differentiate the base of a building from its foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The foundation is the lowest part of a building, but the base is the piece of land that is underneath the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, as the house built by God, the church needs a ground.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When discussing the ground of the church with people, some quote 1 Corinthians 3:11, which says, Another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From this verse they concluded that the Lord Jesus is the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their speaking has confused the ground with the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ground and the foundation are two absolutely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The foundation is the lowest part of a building, and the ground is the base upon which the building is placed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the church is the dwelling place of God, the building of God, it not only needs a foundation but also needs a ground.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even from the point of view of individual believers, it is not good to be a wandering Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, some people are wandering Christians; they do not belong anywhere but come and go from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are like the wandering stars spoken of in Jude 13.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a Christian, we need to be stable and settled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order for us to be settled, we need a place, a ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because conditions change, we cannot be settled merely based on a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can be settled only in a place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, both the church and even individual believers need a ground.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH BEING LOCAL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ground of the church must be local because the expression of the church is in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In lesson 14 we saw that the expression of the church is in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since the expression of the church is in a locality, the ground must also be local.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, as I am standing at the podium, I am being expressed at the podium; consequently, the podium is spontaneously my ground.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the church is expressed in a locality, the locality is the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The universe is not the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the church is not expressed in a locality, it cannot exist in the universe because the universe is something in the air, without a solid ground.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a point of dispute that others have had with us in the past few years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They always speak concerning the universal church, but we insist that there must be local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes I have said to them, You speak concerning the universal church, but can you show me where it is?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I speak concerning local churches, I can immediately point out definite places, including Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, Rome, London, New York City, and Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, you cannot show me the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may speak concerning the universe, but really, you are in a locality, and if you were not in a locality, you would not be in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do we see this?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Speaking of the universe is too vague; only a locality is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thank the Lord that the ground of the church is local, not universal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where does the Lord place the church?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to see clearly that the Lord places the church in localities.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, in the New Testament there are many churches in different localities, such as the church in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , the church in Antioch 13:1 , the church in Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 , the church in Ephesus Rev 2:1 , the church in Smyrna v. 8 , the church in Pergamos v. 12 , the church in Thyatira v. 18 , the church in Sardis 3:1 , the church in Philadelphia v. 7 , and the church in Laodicea v. 14 . All of these churches were in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a pity that people do not see the word in when they read these verses in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word in, which many people often miss when they read the Bible, is used in two important ways in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first in relates to being in Christ: There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus Rom 8:1 ; so then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation 2 Cor 5:17 ; obey your parents in the Lord Eph 6:1 ; rejoice in the Lord always Phil 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people read obey your parents but do not read in the Lord; they read rejoice always but do not read in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The second in relates to the churches in a locality: the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, etc. We need to see the significance of the second in . Being in Christ is a matter of our redemption and enjoyment of God, and being in a certain locality is a matter of our knowing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Over the past twenty years it has become very clear that if we do not resolve this matter of locality, the problem of the church will never be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we studied church history in the beginning, we received significant help on the matter of the church from the light the Brethren received over one hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But the help they gave us did not solve all the problems, because their light regarding locality was not very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 1933 after spending much time and effort in the Word, Watchman Nee saw the second in. The believers are in Christ, and the church is in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once we are detached from Christ, we lose our position of salvation; once we are detached from a locality, we lose the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is true that in the spiritual aspect, the church is also in Christ, but in the aspect of practicality, the church is altogether in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without being in a locality, the church cannot be contacted and touched.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since the church is expressed in a locality, the locality is the ground where the church is placed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Let me repeat, the ground of the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Concerning this matter, we need to pay attention to several points.</S>
