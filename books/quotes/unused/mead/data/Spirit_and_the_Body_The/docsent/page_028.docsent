   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEALING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the anointing comes the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sealing is rather easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Any kind of painting is also a sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes we mark things by painting them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To mark something with a seal is to declare that we own that particular thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although there may be thousands of copies of a certain book, by putting my mark, my seal, upon a particular book, I declare that it belongs to me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In like manner, the anointing within us as the sealing declares to the universe that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God possesses us, and He has put Himself upon us as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This seal is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Oh, I would like to proclaim to everyone, to the angels, to the demons, and to the universe, "Don't touch me!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have a mark upon me, and this mark is God, the all-inclusive Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do you not have such a mark upon you, showing that you belong to God?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yes, you do, for you have been sealed with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the ointment is within you, and the mark is upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BEARING THE IMAGE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you put your seal upon a piece of paper, the paper will bear the image of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The anointing within us becomes the seal, and the seal bears the very image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way, we bear the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that we express God by being anointed and by being sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because God has sealed us, marked us with Himself, the image of God is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not bear the image of God by trying to imitate God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Christians have been taught to imitate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were told, "Now that you are a child of God, you must glorify Him by improving your behavior."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This improvement of behavior is not Christ; it is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need to try to improve your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has sealed you with Himself as the all-inclusive paint.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Has not God painted you?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Has He not put Himself upon you?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Has He not put Himself into you?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have been sealed with God both within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all have been sealed, painted, anointed with God, inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, we bear the image of this seal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Take the example of a young person who has recently been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a sense, after someone is saved, he does not need anyone to teach him, for spontaneously, religiously, and naturally he will have the concept of improving himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A young sister may say, "Formerly, I did not treat my mother very well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now that I am saved, I should be a nice daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I must be gentle and mild toward my mother.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I shall make up my mind never to be unkind to her again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>O Lord Jesus, You know that I am so weak and sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, help me to be gentle and kind to my mother from now on."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, after praying in this way, she will behave either like a scorpion or like a turtle, not like a mild, gentle dove.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I tried to change my behavior for years, but I was never successful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day I realized that I had been anointed and sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I saw this, I was happy, beside myself, and full of praise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It seemed that I forgot where I was.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Spontaneously I began to be kind to my mother; yet, I had no realization that I was being kind to her.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was the bearing of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day I heard my mother telling a friend, "You know my son, Witness, is a quick person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I don't know what has happened to him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the last several weeks, he has been so kind to me."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After hearing this, I said, "Mother, I am not really so kind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I didn't have any change."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to my feeling, I had no change, but actually I was altogether a different person, a person bearing the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was not the result of trying to improve my behavior; it was the result of His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not try to be good or to improve your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you are bothered with your temper, do not try to adjust it, for the more you try to adjust yourself, the worse your behavior will be.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Forget about your temper and your behavior, and praise the Lord for His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise Him that you are attached, anointed, and sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a married sister did this, she would spontaneously become an excellent wife.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, if she tries to be a good wife, she will become worse as a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some may ask, "What kind of teaching is this?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have been teaching people to improve their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now you are telling them not to try to change themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yes, I do say that you should not try to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead, simply enjoy the anointing and the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If a married couple did this, they would have the best married life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if they forget to praise the Lord for His anointing, the wife may be like a turtle, and the husband may be like a cat trying to catch the turtle.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to praise the Lord for the anointing that brings in the divine element and for the sealing that gives us the image of God.</S>
