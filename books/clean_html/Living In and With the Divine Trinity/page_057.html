<P>Second Corinthians 5 goes on to show us that God has wrought us for our transfiguration with the Spirit as the pledge (vv. 2-5). Verse 17 says that we are a new creation in Christ. Many Christians know this verse, but they do not know the real significance of this term&#151;the new creation. We have to realize that we were not only regenerated but also re-created. We were regenerated to be a new man and re-created to be a new creation. We are in another creation. We do not belong to the old creation, and we are not in the old creation. Now we are in the new creation as a new man.</P><P>Eventually, 2 Corinthians reveals that we need to express the virtues of Christ as meekness, forbearance, and truth (10:1; 11:10). Our Christian virtues are a product of the divine virtues of God. The five metaphors that we have seen in 2 Corinthians 2&#151;4 are great items, whereas the virtues of Christ mentioned in chapters ten and eleven may be considered as small items. This shows that the all-inclusive Christ covers not only big items but also the small, fine items of the Christian virtues. In the Life-study of Philippians, we gave seven messages on the subject of forbearance (see messages fifty-six through sixty-two of the Life-study of Philippians, pp. 489-549). In those messages, I contrasted forbearance with anxiety. If we would have forbearance, we must be released from anxiety. It is difficult to express the real meaning of the Greek word for forbearance. This word means reasonableness, considerateness, and consideration in dealing with others, without strictness of legal right. This implies that we can fit in any kind of situation to meet the need of any kind of person. It means that we are humble, that we can give in to others, and that we are able to fit any situation and any circumstance with anybody. A forbearing person can fit in with both the older generation and the younger generation.</P><P>Forbearance seemingly is a small virtue, but actually it is great. If we are forbearing persons, we are great persons. If I easily lose my temper when someone makes a mistake, am I a great person? When we lose our temper in this way, we are small persons. A great person embraces all kinds of people. A forbearing person, a great person, can even embrace the ones who oppose him. The Lord Jesus charged us in Matthew 5:44 to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us. This is the expression of forbearance.</P><P>I have seen some saints who have been offended and would never forget that offense. Some wives never forget how their husbands have offended them. In the biblical sense, to forgive is to forget. Without forgetting, forgiving means nothing. If we do not forget others' offenses, this means we have not forgiven them. Forgiving is forgetting. When God forgives us, He washes away the stain of our sin (Psa. 51:7; 1 John 1:7). Furthermore, He remembers our sins no more (Heb. 8:12). We need to be one with our God to forgive people to such an extent.</P><P>A new church in a new locality is always sweet, and the church life there is in the "honeymoon stage." However, after the church has been there for ten years, the offenses accumulate. This mountain of offenses can kill the entire church life. Among all the local churches on this earth, it is hard to find one that has been existing for over five years without the accumulation of offenses. These offenses are a big stumbling block. We have to stop to move this stumbling block, this mountain, out of the way. Then we can drive on, and the church life can go on. Why is it that a couple can be married for many years, and yet they become separated and then divorced? This is because of the accumulated offenses. The husband offends the wife, and the wife offends the husband again and again with no mutual forgiveness. This accumulation of offenses leads to separation and then divorce. There is divorce because there is no forbearance. To be proper Christians, we need forbearance. Forbearance implies forgiveness, lowliness, giving in, and fitting in with others under any kind of situation. Paul told us that he had the meekness and forbearance of Christ because he had been attached to Christ. Paul realized that he was one with Christ. Because of this, Paul also realized that he had the virtues of Christ's human life. Paul not only enjoyed Christ's divinity in great things but also enjoyed His humanity in the detailed items of Christ's human virtues based upon the divine attributes.</P>
