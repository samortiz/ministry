   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 2 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 3:6 That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>4:24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8:16 The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regenerated in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a sinner repents, confesses his sins, believes in the Lord Jesus, and calls on His name, at that very moment Christ as the life-giving Spirit enters into his spirit to enliven his dead spirit, that is, to regenerate him in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Immediately such a person becomes alive, happy, and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A great change has taken place in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This sinner has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has been regenerated, and he is now a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>48</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Divine Spirit and the Human Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for us to experience the Christian life, we surely need to know God, the Lord, Christ, as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Also, we have to know that for us to enjoy this Spirit, we have a spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence , the foundation of the Christian life is the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>49</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament three verses that speak of both the human spirit and the divine Spirit are: John 3:6; 4:24, and Romans 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first spirit in this verse is God's Spirit, and the second is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that our spirit is born of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The birth of the spirit in John 3:6 is not the first birth, the natural birth; it is the second birth, the spiritual birth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the saved ones have been born twice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first birth, from our parents, is the birth in the flesh; the second birth, from God, is the birth in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah for the second birth!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are the second-birth people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never forget the two spirits in John 3:6 the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another precious verse about these two spirits is John 4:24.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse says, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here again we see that God is a Spirit and that we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would worship God, we must worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As human beings, we have many organs: eyes for seeing, ears for hearing, a mouth for speaking and eating, a nose for smelling and breathing, hands for working, and feet for walking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also have our various inward organs, including a stomach for retaining and digesting food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition to all these organs, we have a spirit with which to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man was made by God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was made to worship God, to contact God, to receive God, to retain God, and even to digest God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your religious mentality may be offended at the thought of digesting God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yes, we must digest God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life and that we must eat Him John 6:35, 54-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus is edible!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we eat Him, we must also digest Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The function of the organ of our spirit is to worship, contact, receive, retain, and digest God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may call this organ our spiritual stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the organ for digesting God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to receive God into this part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The third verse concerning the two spirits is Romans 8:16.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This verse says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we see that the divine Spirit witnesses with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times these two spirits talk to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our spirit may say, "God is my Father," and the divine Spirit will say, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The divine Spirit may say, "You are a child of God," and our spirit will say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all need to become thoroughly familiar with these three verses on the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Remember, in John 3:6 our spirit is born of the Spirit; in John 4:24, our spirit worships the Spirit; and in Romans 8:16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These three verses are virtually all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In John 3:6 we are reborn, in John 4:24 we digest God and enjoy Him, and in Romans 8:16 we walk with God, live by God, and are one with God in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the Christian life, the Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>50</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
