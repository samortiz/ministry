   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Concerning Miracles and Healing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible records many miracles and works of wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many such miracles are related to the healing of sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are signs used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But many heresies in this world attract men by miracles and works of wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord prophesied that before His coming again, many miracles would appear to deceive men Matt 24:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A big part of heretical teachings involves the healing of sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These heresies attract men by their power of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to be careful about all forms of healing and supernatural phenomena.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The miracles and supernatural events in the Bible were initiated by the Holy Spirit through the hands of men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Holy Spirit acknowledges Jesus as the Lord; He testifies for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is nothing wrong for a man who has faith, who has a word from God, and who believes in such a word to pray and anoint sick ones in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But some miracle workers in some heretical groups do not believe in sickness and death at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They say that both sickness and death are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it is interesting that they themselves also die.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christian Scientists do not believe in aging, sickness, or death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After Mary Baker Eddy died, a scandal developed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Her will instructed that a certain sum of money be given to her followers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet her followers insisted before a judge that she had not died.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The judge considered this to be absurd, because if she had not died, the will could not go into effect, and the church could not claim her inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet if she had died, it would disprove her teaching about the absence of sickness, pain, sin, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not be too obsessed with healing and miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sickness is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some sicknesses are the result of natural laws.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some sicknesses are the result of attacks from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some sicknesses are the result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, we believe in the existence of sickness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, we also believe in supernatural acts as the free manifestation of the work of the Holy Spirit, who always acknowledges Christ Jesus as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we should also realize that the world likes to believe in strange and inexplicable things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should exercise our care in discerning these things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>G. Concerning Prophecies</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people believe that the Lord will come again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Lord told us that no one knows the day of His coming, not even the angels or the Son of Man Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a basic principle concerning the day of Christ s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jehovah s Witnesses believe that Christ came in 1874.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The founder of the group, Charles T. Russell, preached this, and his follower Joseph Rutherford continued this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The strange thing is that even though they claimed that they saw the coming of the Lord, we do not see it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They say that we are already in the millennium and that this is the reason for all the wonderful inventions like the typewriter, the telephone, and the automobile.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some also believe that the Lord Jesus entered the Holy of Holies in heaven in 1844.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Others say that Christ came in 1918.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two places in the Bible speak of a day as a year: Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some base their arguments on these verses and postulate that a day signifies a year in every prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But God only said that in certain particular things a day is like a year.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not say that this is true for all things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is wrong to calculate the day of Christ s coming according to this day-year theory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seventy weeks in the book of Daniel may fit the day-year theory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But other than that, all other days should be considered merely as days.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a person says that a day is always a year, then the millennium would be a period of three hundred and sixty thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some would then argue that a day, being short, can be interpreted as a long year, but that a year, being so long, is a long enough period, and there is no need for further interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is tiresome to argue about these things, and we do not have to bother ourselves with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All those who predict the day of Christ s return based on the day-year theory are in danger of being heretical.</S>
