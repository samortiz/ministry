   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible speaks of the ministry of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This ministry consists of a group of people wholly separated from the world to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They have no other occupation or duty other than to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such people are called priests in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE HISTORY OF THE PRIESTHOOD IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Beginning from the book of Genesis, we find God calling men to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Melchisedec was God s first priest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Abraham s time, Melchisedec separated himself and gave himself solely to God s service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. From Genesis to the Period</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>after the Lord s Ascension</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From Genesis to the forming of the nation of Israel and thereafter, the priesthood was always present.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the time the Lord Jesus was on earth and even after His departure from the earth, the priesthood did not cease.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The priesthood has been on earth for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible shows us that even the Lord Jesus became a priest before God after His ascension to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is there now fully consecrated for God s service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. In the Dispensation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The priesthood continues throughout the dispensation of the church; there is no interruption of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. In the Millennial Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the beginning of the millennial kingdom, those who share in the first resurrection will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years Rev 20:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s children will continue to be God s priests and Christ s priests for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will be kings to the world and priests to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This priesthood will remain unchanged; they will still serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>D. In the New Heavens and New Earth</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the new heavens and new earth, the term priest will cease to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time, all of God s children as His servants will do nothing except serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Jerusalem His slaves will serve Him 22:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, God s children will continue to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we must point out a most wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The priesthood commenced with Melchisedec, the one who was without father, without mother, without genealogy, who had neither beginning of days nor end of life Heb 7:3 , and it extends to the end of the millennium, which means that it extends to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE KINGDOM OF PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BECOMING THE HOUSE OF PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the revelation of the Scripture, God s purpose is not to have only one or two persons as His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His purpose is to have all His people as His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A. God Choosing the Israelites</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>to Be a Kingdom of Priests</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the Israelites came out of Egypt, they came to Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God charged Moses to speak to the Israelites, saying, Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation Exo 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God told the Israelites that they would be a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This expression is somewhat difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why did God say that they would be a kingdom of priests?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He meant that He wanted the whole nation to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one in the nation would be an ordinary person; the whole kingdom would be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God chose Israel to be His people, He set this goal before them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This nation was to be different from all other nations on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the people of this nation would be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This meant that every person in the nation would have one unique occupation, the occupation of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God delights in separating men from the earth for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He delights in seeing men live solely for His affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God wants all of His children to be priests and to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God told the people of Israel when they reached Mount Sinai that He would make them a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a wonderful calling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We call England the kingdom of the navy, the United States, the kingdom of gold, China, the kingdom of manners and virtues, and India the kingdom of philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But here is a kingdom which is called the kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everyone in this nation is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Men, women, adults, and children are all priests.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everyone in this kingdom serves only God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Both adults and children have only one thing as their occupation offering sacrifices and serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a wonderful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After God promised to establish Israel as a kingdom of priests, He told Moses to go up the mountain to receive the Ten Commandments which were written upon two tablets of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Moses remained on the mountain forty days while God wrote the Ten Commandments on the stone tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The first commandment says, Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The second says, Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image 20:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It seems that God was dictating the commandments one by one.</S>
