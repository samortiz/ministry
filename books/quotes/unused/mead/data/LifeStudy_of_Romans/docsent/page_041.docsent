   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Were Constituted Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 5:19 tells us, through the obedience of the One shall the many be constituted righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not only righteous; we are constituted righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you paint my skin green, that will not affect my inward constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, if you inject green paint into my blood, my whole being eventually will be constituted with green paint.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This would not be outward painting, but inward constituting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the living God comes into our being as grace, we are constituted righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Were Justified unto Life</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A further result of Christ s obedience is that we have been justified unto life 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since we have been constituted righteous, we have come up to the standard of God s righteousness and now correspond to it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, we are justified unto life spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Adam, through his one offense, we were condemned unto death; in Christ, through His one righteous act, we are justified unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Justification is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First we have justification, then we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Justification changes our outward position, and life changes our inward disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we have both justification outwardly for our position and life inwardly for our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Grace Reigned through Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>unto Life Eternal</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 5:21 says, grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Grace reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have another king because now we are in another kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we were in the kingdom of death, and sin was our king through death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we are in the kingdom of life, and grace is our king.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Grace reigns through righteousness unto life eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This thought is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why must grace reign through righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we had not been constituted sinners, we would have been clean and righteous, with nothing in our being contradicting God s character.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If such had been the case, we would not have needed righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we were constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can grace, which is God Himself, reign over such unrighteous people?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Grace needs an instrument, a means to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This instrument, this means, is God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, grace reigns through God s righteousness unto life eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because Christ has died on the cross to accomplish redemption for us and because God s righteousness has been revealed to us, we have a position to enjoy God as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We even have the position to claim God as our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, grace can reign through righteousness unto life eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us apply this to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose I am a sinful, dying man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am condemned to death, and death reigns over me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day I realize that Christ died for me on the cross to accomplish God s redemption, and God s righteousness is revealed to me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a sinner, I come to God under the redeeming blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Immediately, the righteousness of God binds Him to justify me, and He becomes my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can claim Him as my portion because the redemption of Christ has fulfilled all the requirements of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I now have the position to claim Him as my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because of His righteousness, He has to come to me as grace for my enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Grace means that I receive a gift which I do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I work for you, you owe me my wages as a debt, not as a grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if you present me five hundred dollars as a gift, that is grace, for I do not deserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through God s righteousness I receive grace, which I do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has given Himself to us as a grace that we do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We never worked for it and we cannot pay for it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The price is too high.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God simply gives Himself to us as grace through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This grace becomes our portion for our enjoyment and reigns through righteousness, resulting in life eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This does not refer to eternal blessing, but to eternal life, which we may enjoy today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not the human life or the created life; it is the divine, eternal and uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Under the blood of Christ, we claim God as our portion, and we receive from God a measure which we do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This measure is grace as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The issue of this enjoyment is life eternal, a life which will transform our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It will sanctify us completely and deal thoroughly with our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, we will become sanctified, transformed, conformed and glorified persons.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>e. In Christ All Shall Be Made Alive</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In Adam all die, but in Christ all shall be made alive 1 Cor 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Adam s transgression caused and still causes all his descendants to die, but Christ s obedience causes all men to live.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Adam all are dying; in Christ all are living.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The result of Adam s transgression is death unto all.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The result of Christ s obedience is life unto all.</S>
