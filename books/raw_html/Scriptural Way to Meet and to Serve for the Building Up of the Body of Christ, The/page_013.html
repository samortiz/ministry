 <h2 class="head2">In Considering One Another<br />
and in Exhorting One Another</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:24 says, &ldquo;And let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works.&rdquo; &ldquo;Considering one another&rdquo; indicates mutuality. I take care of you, and you take care of me&mdash;this is mutuality. Exhorting one another in verse 25 also indicates mutuality. In the New Testament, exhortation is mutual; it is not just in one direction. With exhortation there should be a two-way traffic as indicated by the words &ldquo;one another&rdquo; in verse 25. In the meetings of Christianity, exhortation is usually from one direction&mdash;from the pastor to the congregation; there is no exhortation which goes back to the pastor. However, when we meet, our exhortation must be among ourselves; it must be mutual.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Teaching and in Admonishing</h2>
<p>Teaching and admonishing is also in mutuality (Col. 3:16). We speak to one another, teaching and admonishing one another. Sometimes, the sisters could admonish the brothers. The sisters should not say that because they are not teachers, they cannot speak. They should not teach (1 Tim. 2:12), but they should admonish. We admonish one another because we love each other. We are members of the same Body, so I admonish you and you admonish me.</p>
<p>When I was young, I discovered that some Christian teachers said that females could teach in the church meetings, but others said that they could not. One day in Los Angeles in 1963, a brother who was knowledgeable of the Bible attended our meetings. When he observed that the sisters spoke in the meetings, he asked me why we allowed the sisters to speak. He said that the sisters should be silent. I responded by asking him whether or not the sisters were silent in his meetings. He said that they were. I then asked him if the sisters sang in his meetings. He affirmed that they did. Then I asked him whether or not singing was a kind of speaking. In other words, as long as the sisters were singing in his meeting, they were not actually silent. Then I asked why the sisters were allowed to sing and were not allowed to pray.</p>
<p>How strange this was! It is strange that the sisters were qualified to sing hymns, but not qualified to pray. According to 1 Corinthians 11:5, however, women may pray and prophesy in the meeting, but they must do this under the covering of the brothers. The sisters must be emancipated to speak in the church meeting. They must be encouraged to speak, but not in terms of teaching. The sisters should not teach, but they can exhort and admonish. Many times, mothers can admonish their children better than fathers; likewise, the sisters are usually very skillful in admonishing. This is because the sisters are fine, not rough or coarse. Brothers, on the other hand, may be rough and coarse. When the brothers say &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; it can be very rough. However, when the sisters say &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; it can be like music, very pleasant to our ears. Since admonishing is a fine work, it is sometimes very difficult for the brothers to admonish. As a brother, teaching is very easy for me. But I may not be as qualified to admonish as some of the sisters. When the brothers admonish, the saints may not listen very much. But when a dear sister comes and admonishes, everyone may listen and obey. This illustrates why we need the sisters to speak. As long as they would speak and not teach, everything is fine.</p>
<p>All the sisters should be encouraged to speak. Many of the sisters need to be &ldquo;emancipated,&rdquo; not from man&rsquo;s control but from their own control. Many sisters control themselves too much. It is always good for a sister to be quiet, gentle, and meek. I agree with and appreciate this. But I do not agree that the sisters&rsquo; mouths would be shut in the meeting. The sisters need to be gentle and meek, but speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING A HIGH PRICE TO REACH THE STANDARD</h2>
<p>To reach the standard of these characteristics of the believers&rsquo; meetings requires that we pay a high price. We must endeavor to reach this highest standard so that our meetings could be revolutionized, bearing the proper characteristics. Once our meetings are converted from the old way into the new way, the Lord will have something according to His New Testament economy.</p>
