FOR THE FINALIZATION OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The revelation we have received as a heavenly vision also comprises a third item. This item can be seen in the book of Revelation. The Triune God embodied, realized, and consummated through seven major steps is now within us and upon us. We are wrapped up with Him, within and without. We are full of the divine water. Inside us is the Spirit as the drinking water and outside us is the Spirit as the baptizing water. Although this is altogether wonderful, the church became degraded. This is why the book of Revelation is needed.</p>
<p>Christ as the embodiment of God in the four Gospels was gentle, mild, meek, and loving. John, the writer of Revelation, could lie in the bosom of that loving One (John 13:23). In Revelation, though, this Christ is altogether different. He has seven eyes (Rev. 5:6) which are as a flame of fire (Rev. 1:14). This One is worthy to open the universal secret of God&rsquo;s economy (Rev. 5:2, 5). He is the One taking care of the churches as the High Priest trimming the lamps and filling the lamps with oil (Rev. 1:13). He is also the One who administrates this universe and is going to inherit, to take possession, of both the sea and the land (Rev. 10:2). He is the One who is coming back to establish God&rsquo;s government on this earth (Rev. 11:15).</p>
<p>The seven Spirits, as the intensification of the Triune God, are the seven eyes of the Lion-Lamb to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The Triune God was embodied in the Son, realized and consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit, and as the seven Spirits, the intensification of the Triune God in the book of Revelation, He finalizes His New Testament economy. The finalization of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is by the consummated Spirit as the sevenfold intensified Spirit, the intensification of the Triune God.</p>
<p>It is not adequate for us merely to see the first two points of the vision in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must go further to see the third point of our vision which involves our facing and overcoming the situation of degradation in the church. In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord points out many ugly mixtures. While the church was progressing throughout history, many mixtures came in to corrupt the church. As the High Priest, Christ is trimming the burned out wicks of the lampstands. In another sense, He is purifying the degraded church from all of the different kinds of mixtures.</p>
<p>By His trimming, by His purifying, He graciously brings the degraded church back to the enjoyment of Himself, to the eating of the tree of life (2:7), to the eating of the hidden manna (2:17), and to feasting with Him (3:20). The result of the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3 is to bring back the degraded churches to the very enjoyment of this wonderful One. God&rsquo;s desire for man to eat the tree of life in Genesis 2 is fulfilled in the Lord&rsquo;s promise to the overcomer to eat of the tree of life. The tree of life today is in the church as God&rsquo;s garden, paradise. We are here eating the tree of life; however, we have not reached God&rsquo;s goal yet. We are traveling in the wilderness, and as we are traveling He is our daily manna. In the degradation of the churches He is no longer the open manna but the hidden manna. He is not the manna in the wilderness, but the manna within the Holy of Holies. We have to be brought back to the enjoyment of such an item&mdash;the hidden manna. Eventually, we will be brought back to the Lord as a feast. In the epistle to the church in Laodicea the Lord promises to dine with the one who opens the door to Him. To dine is not merely to eat one food, but the riches of a meal. This may refer to the eating of the rich produce of the good land of Canaan by the children of Israel (Josh. 5:10-12). We will enjoy all the rich produce of the good land which is the all-inclusive Christ. This is marvelous! What else can compare with this?</p>
<p>The finalization of God&rsquo;s economy will be the New Jerusalem with the tree of life in its center (Rev. 22:1-2). The tree of life has fruit and leaves. The leaves of the tree of life are for the healing of the nations who are not regenerated but restored. The regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their life and life supply inwardly, that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity; whereas the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life. The nations are restored miraculously, but we believers are sustained by life. We are not the nations, but we are the sons produced by regeneration and sustained by the enjoyment of the fruit of the tree of life, that is, by the very essence of the tree of life. We are now enjoying the New Jerusalem as the finalization of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. For eternity we will enjoy life and life alone. Leave the leaves to the nations. We will enjoy nothing else but life. This is our vision.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
