   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eighteen Cubits High Apiece</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The pillars were "eighteen cubits high apiece" 1 Kings 7:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we shall see, the circumference of each pillar was twelve cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eighteen cubits is half of three units of twelve cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, eighteen is half of three complete units.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The three units signify the very Triune God who has been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would be pillars, we must firstly judge ourselves and then be filled, saturated, and permeated with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As I was wondering why each pillar was a half of three complete units, the Lord said, "Stupid man, have you not given several messages saying that the standing boards in the tabernacle were each one and a half cubits wide?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Didn't you say that no board could stand by itself, but that it had to stand with another?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Don't you see that it is the same with the pillars?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as the two boards standing together made three complete cubits, so the two pillars make three complete units."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then I said, "Now I understand, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you would be a pillar, you must be filled, saturated, and permeated with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, no matter how much you have been filled with God, you are still only a part.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At most, you are one half.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You can never have God completely.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The very God who is in you is also in your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because you are not a full unit, you need others to complete you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the spiritual giants think that they can be complete individu- alistically.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the Bible reveals that everyone is only a half.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The standing boards in the tabernacle were a half Exo 26:15-16 , and each of the pillars in the temple is a half.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When they hear this, some may say, "Brother Lee is allegorizing the Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I am allegorizing, then I have the ground to allegorize.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why does the Bible not say that the pillars were seventeen or nineteen cubits high?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Would it be possible to allegorize if the pillars were this height?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No, it would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But, as I was seeking the Lord, He showed me that in this section of the Word twelve is the complete unit and eighteen is one and a half units.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that although we might be filled with the Triune God, God will never wholly commit Himself to us individually.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No matter how much of God we gain, we are not the whole; we are only a part.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I need you, and you need me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord always sent out His disciples two by two Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1; Acts 13:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not the number thirty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At most, I am the number eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No matter how tall you are, you must realize that you are only eighteen cubits and that you need others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not say, "I am perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You all need me, but I don't need you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is foolish to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At most, we can be only eighteen cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some sisters dream about being filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But no matter how much they are filled with Him, they could never be more than half a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They need others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>ee.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Twelve Cubits Round</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we come to the circumference of the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First Kings 7:15 says, "A line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As far as language is concerned, the composition of this verse is very peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead of speaking of the circumference, it says that a "line of twelve cubits" encompassed the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even this rendering is not an exact, literal translation; it is somewhat of an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One version says, "a circumference of twelve cubits."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This rendering is simple and I prefer it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, the Bible has no waste of words, and we must consider the meaning of the actual composition of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It means to use a thread as a line to measure around the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The purpose of this is to impress us with the completion and perfection of our being mingled with God in His eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The number seven, which signifies perfection and completion in God's move in this age, is composed of four plus three.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a matter of addition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the number twelve, which is composed of four times three, is a matter of multiplication, indicating that the creature is mingled with the Triune God and that this mingling must be complete and perfect in God's eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The pillars are not square, rectangular, or triangular; they are round, circular, signifying that their perfection is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As we put together the brass, the height of eighteen cubits, and the circumference of twelve cubits, we see that in order to be a pillar we must be under God's judgment and that we must be fully, thoroughly, and completely saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must be brass and we must be twelve cubits around.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nevertheless, no matter how completely we have been mingled with God, we are still only a half; we need another half.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If any elder is like this, he will certainly be an outstanding elder.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If any leading sister is like this, she will be a most excellent sister.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This kind of person certainly can bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our problem is that we do not condemn ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, we vindicate, justify, approve, and excuse ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Often we say, "That is not my mistake; it is Brother So-and-so's mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am always careful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am not wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is self-vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After we vindicate ourselves, we proceed to justify and approve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We do not need to be tested, for we have already approved ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In our eyes, there is no problem with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Sometimes, however, we are caught in a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we excuse ourselves, perhaps by saying, "I made that mistake because the meeting was so long and I was tired."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How often we make exits for ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have four big exits: self-vindication, self-justification, self-approval, and self-excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even when we are caught in a mistake, we still excuse ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For example, a sister may say, "I type poorly because the others have the best typewriters and the worst typewriter is allotted to me."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the past, I have had a lot of self-vindication, self-justification, self-approval, and self-excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Very rarely does a husband or wife at the beginning of an argument, say, "I'm sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is my mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Please forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, the wife says, "Do you know why I was so strong with my husband?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It was because he is always late.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Throughout our whole marriage, his lateness has troubled me."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then the husband will say, "My wife never sympathizes with me.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I am busy and have a great deal of work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When I am overworked like this, how can I help being late?"</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is self-vindication, self-justification, self-approval, and self-excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we would daily crucify these four things, there would be no fighting whatever in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is inadequate for us simply to be the number four.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must be number seven four plus the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This, however, is still the initial stage, not the consummation, which is the number twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In order to be the number twelve, we must be filled, saturated, and mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When we are fully saturated and mingled with God, we are adequate for God's eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Nevertheless, as we have pointed out, even after we have become the number twelve, we are still only eighteen cubits in height.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We are only half a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we were all like this, there would be no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Instead of fighting with others, we would condemn ourselves, saying, "Lord, I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I have been crucified, and Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It is not I, but the grace of God that is with me."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is the brass, the judgment, and the twelve cubits, the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Since we are, at most, only a half, we need others for God's economy and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If you pray over these points, you will see that this is the pillar that can bear the responsibility in the house of God.</S>
