   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN CORRUPTED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE TREE OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But, as we know, Adam was induced to take the second source, the tree of knowledge, into himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was not a matter of merely doing something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was much more serious than transgressing God's law and regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The significance of Adam taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge was that he received Satan into himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Adam did not take the branch of that tree, he took the fruit of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fruit contains the reproducing power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, when the fruit of a peach tree is planted in the earth, soon another little peach tree will sprout up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Adam was the "earth."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he took the fruit of the tree of knowledge into himself as the earth, he received Satan, who then grew in him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Oh, this is not a small matter!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not many Christians have realized the fall of Adam in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fruit of Satan was sown in Adam as a seed in the soil; thus, Satan grew in Adam and became a part of him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we need to discover into what part of Adam Satan was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan not only came into Adam when he fell in the garden, but he still remains in the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where is he located in the human race?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are a tripartite being: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Look at the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Adam took the fruit of the tree, into what part of his being did it come?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, it came into his body, because he ate it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although this is logical and reasonable, we need scriptural ground to confirm that something of Satan is in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Read Romans 7:23: "But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word "another," in the King James Version, is not a good translation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It should be "a different law" i.e., a law of a different category.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may have three laws of the same category, e.g., the first, and "another" two.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Greek here means a law of a contrasting category.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"But I see a different law in my members the members are the parts of the body , warring against the law of my mind, and making me a captive in the law of sin which is in my members," that is, the parts of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the law of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul said, "...no longer I...but sin that dwells in me" Rom 7:20 , and, "...no longer I...but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we have the contrast between "no longer I...but sin," and "no longer I...but Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the embodiment of God, but sin is the embodiment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word "sin" in Romans 7 should be capitalized, for it is personified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is like a person, for Sin can dwell in us and force us to do things against our will Rom 7:17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is even stronger than us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 6:14 says: "For sin shall not have dominion over you."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is better to translate it: "For Sin shall not have the lordship over you," or, "for Sin shall not be lord over you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sin can be lord over us; hence, Sin must be the evil one, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through the fall, Satan came into man as Sin, and is ruling, damaging, corrupting and mastering him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In what part?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan is in the members of man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man's body as originally created by God was something very good, but it has now become the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The body was pure, since it was created good, but when the body was corrupted by Satan, it became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul said, "...in me, that is in my flesh, nothing good dwells" Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By the fall, Satan came to dwell in our body, causing our body to become flesh i.e., a damaged, ruined body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The book of Romans uses two terms, "the body of sin" 6:6 and "the body of this death" 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The body is called "the body of sin" because Sin is in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The body simply became the residence of Sin, which is the embodiment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What, then, is "the body of this death"?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The source and power of death is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sin is the embodiment of Satan and death is the issue or effect of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This corrupted, transmuted body is called the "body of sin," and the "body of this death," because this body became the very residence of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Both sin and death are related to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"The body of sin" means that the body is sinful, corrupted and enslaved by Sin; "the body of this death" means that the body is weakened and full of death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The body is something satanic and devilish, because Satan dwells in this body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the lusts are in this corrupted body which is called the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Word reveals that the lust is "the lust of the flesh" Gal 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The flesh is the corrupted body full of lusts, indwelt by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now you see that the fall of man was not just a matter of man committing something against God, but of man receiving Satan into his body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Satan, from the time of the fall, dwells in man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is what happened when man partook of the second tree.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since Satan and man became one through the second tree, Satan is no longer outside of man, but in man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The prince of the air, Satan himself, is working in the disobedient people Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Satan was joyful, boasting that he had succeeded in taking over man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But God, who was still outside of man, seemed to say: "I will also become incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If Satan wrought himself into man, then let Me enter man and put man upon Myself."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do you see the complicated situation?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God put on this man Satan being in him through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When God became incarnated as a man, the kind of man He put on was a man corrupted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Man, at the time of His incarnation, was no longer a pure man, but a man ruined, corrupted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let us read Romans 8:3: "God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin" not "sinful flesh," as in the King James Version, but "the flesh of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the Lord Jesus incarnated Himself in flesh, He was "in the likeness of the flesh of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There was no sin within Him, but there was "the likeness of the flesh of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Sin was within the corrupted man, but there was no sin within the Lord Jesus; there was only the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Old Testament illustrates this in the type of the brass serpent on the pole.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That serpent, made of brass, was a type of Christ John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When Christ was on the cross, He was a man in "the likeness" of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The serpent is Satan, the devil, the enemy of God, but when Christ was incarnated as a man, He had even the likeness of the sinful flesh, which is the likeness of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is rather difficult for anyone to understand this easily.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is really quite complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Let me repeat.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Man was made pure, but one day Satan came into man to possess him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Satan was joyful, thinking he had succeeded in taking over man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then God put upon Himself the man with Satan within him.</S>
