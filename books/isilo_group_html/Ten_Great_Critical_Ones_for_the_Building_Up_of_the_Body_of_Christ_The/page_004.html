The Unique Bible Being Consistent in Its Unique Revelation</h2><p>The Bible is consistent in its unique revelation. The Baptists stress baptism by their kind of immersion, whereas the Presbyterians and others practice sprinkling. But the practice of baptism is not the Bible&#8217;s unique revelation.<h2 class=head3>1. Not Interpreted according to Man&#8217;s Own Concepts</h2><p>The Bible should not be interpreted according to man&#8217;s own concepts-understandings, logic, philosophies, views, and fanciful imaginations. These concepts should be altogether abandoned. Peter indicates that we do not have the freedom to interpret the prophecy of the Bible by our natural concept, because it is revealed by God (2 Pet. 1:20-21). We have to pray for God to help us know His original meaning in speaking such a prophecy.<h2 class=head3>2. Any Interpretation of the Unique Bible Being Governed by the Principles of Its Interpretation</h2><p>Any interpretation of the unique Bible should be governed by the principles of its interpretation.<h2 class=head4>a. Interpreted Only by and according to Itself</h2><p>First, the unique Bible should be interpreted only by and according to itself. The Bible interprets the Bible. When some of the students of Confucius in China became Christians, they understood the Bible according to the teachings of Confucius. This, of course, is wrong. The Bible must be interpreted by itself and according to itself.<h2 class=head4>b. Interpreted by Discerning the Differences in the Dispensational Progress of the Divine Revelation</h2><p>The Bible should also be interpreted by discerning the differences in the dispensational progress of the divine revelation. This is a big principle. The dispensations in the Bible are important. There are the Old Testament dispensation and the New Testament dispensation. In the Old Testament dispensation the seventh day was ordained by God as the Sabbath, but in the New Testament, the Sabbath was put aside and is over. The Seventh-Day Adventists did not discern this dispensational difference, so they insist on keeping the Sabbath. They charge the New Testament saints to keep something in the Old Testament, and their way to keep the Sabbath is also according to the Old Testament way.<p>We have to see the dispensational progress in the divine revelation. Abraham&#8217;s time was different from Noah&#8217;s time. At Noah&#8217;s time God did not tell His chosen people where to go and where to stay. But God told Abraham to leave his idolatrous country and go to the good land. He also told him to circumcise all of his young males. Such things were not revealed to Noah. The time of Moses was the age, the dispensation, of the law. Then when the Lord Jesus came, that was a big change of dispensation. His coming ushered in the age of grace.<p>Today the Catholic Church mixes up the Old and New Testament dispensations. The Catholic leaders wear robes which are according to the robes of the priests in the Old Testament. The Pentecostals in their practice and concept stay mostly in the Old Testament dispensation. The verses they sing are mostly from the Old Testament. It is rare to hear them sing or give a message from the book of Ephesians, because this book is different from the Pentecostal kind of understanding. Ephesians is deep, but the Pentecostal understanding concerning speaking in tongues and miraculous things is superficial and outward.<p>In our interpretation of the Bible, we must learn one principle-to know the dispensations in God&#8217;s revelation. This is because God&#8217;s revelation is progressive from one stage to another stage, from one dispensation to another dispensation.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Ten Great Critical 'Ones' for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
