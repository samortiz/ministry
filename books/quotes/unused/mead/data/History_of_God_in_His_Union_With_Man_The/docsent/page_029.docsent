   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Its Issue</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The issue of man's fall is terrifyingly great.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It implies mainly the following eight items.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan Entering into Man</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>to Be Man's Indwelling Sin</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan as the evil one Matt 6:13 entered into man through man's eating of his evil fruit from the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through this, Satan's evil nature surely became the evil element added into man's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 7:17-21 unveils that something evil as an evil law dwells in man to be the very sin that dwells in man, causing man to do things that man does not will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is this evil to be the indwelling sin in man's fallen nature?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It must be the evil one, Satan, who dwells in our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This issue of man's fall is too, too terrifying!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sin Entering into Mankind</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since Satan, who is the substantial element of sin, has entered into man, sin spontaneously entered into man with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since this entering of sin into man was its entering into Adam, the forefather of man, sin entered into all of mankind, the world Rom 5:12a , through this one entering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today all of mankind, the whole world, has sin in their fallen nature to make them sinners in their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sin Bringing Death to Mankind</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The very sin which dwells in man is productive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It issues in death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Death is the wages of sin Rom 6:23a and was brought into man through sin Rom 5:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, Satan, sin, and death, three terrifying and damaging factors, entered into man, even mankind, through man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sin Bringing Vanity and the Slavery</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>of Corruption to All the Creation</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sin not only brought death to all mankind but also brought vanity and the slavery of corruption to all the creation Rom 8:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today due to man's fall, all the creation is subjected to vanity and the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everything in God's creation is being corrupted under a kind of slavery and is becoming vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the whole creation is groaning together, and there is no joy in the universe today.</S>
