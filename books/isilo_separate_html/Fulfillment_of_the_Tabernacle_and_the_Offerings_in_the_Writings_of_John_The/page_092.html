The other three Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke- are called the synoptic Gospels, and they record different aspects of the Lord&#8217;s humanity. He is presented as the King in Matthew, as a Slave in Mark, and as the Savior in Luke. The King, the Slave, and the Savior are all related to the humanity of Christ. In the Gospel of John, however, the emphasis is on the divinity of the Lord Jesus. In this Gospel He is revealed as the Son of God (John 1:49; 20:31).<p>Because the Gospel of John reveals Christ in His divinity, this Gospel speaks of things that are mysterious. Divine things are mysterious. The mysterious, divine things recorded in the Gospel of John are the reality of the universe.<h2 class=head1>THE REALITY OF THE UNIVERSE AND OF THE HUMAN VESSELS CREATED BY GOD</h2><p>In a previous message we pointed out that the universe may be regarded as a huge shell. What is the content of this shell, the content of the universe? Throughout the centuries, philosophers, scientists, and teachers have not been able to say what the reality of the universe is. As we have pointed out, if we get into the depths of the truth revealed in the Bible, we shall see that the reality of the universe is the tabernacle and the offerings.<p>Just as the universe has a content, so we human beings also have a content, a reality. If the universe did not have a reality, then the entire universe would be only an empty shell. For there to be no reality in the universe would mean that the universe would not have any content. Likewise, if we had only a physical body but did not have an inner being, we also would be an empty shell. Our inner being is our reality.<p>The Bible reveals that we are vessels. In Romans 9:21 and 23 Paul says, &#8220;Has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?...And what if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory...?&#8221;<p>As vessels created by God, we can be compared to bottles designed to contain a particular beverage. But suppose a certain bottle is empty. An empty bottle does not have any content, and without content, the bottle does not have any meaning. In order for a bottle to have meaning and fulfill its purpose, it needs to be filled with the beverage it was designed to contain.<p>The principle is the same with us as vessels. We were designed by God to contain a heavenly beverage. Jesus refers to this beverage in John 7:37 when, on the last day of the feast of tabernacles, He stood up and cried, &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (John 7:37-38). Here we see that the human vessel may not only be filled with living water, filled with the heavenly beverage, but may also overflow with this living water. First we are filled with living water, and then living water flows out from our inner being.<p>In his Gospel the Apostle John emphasizes truth, reality. We see this in the opening chapter of the Gospel of John: &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality....grace and reality came through Jesus Christ&#8221; (vv. 14, 17). In these verses reality, or truth, does not refer to doctrine. John is not saying in 1:14 that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of doctrine. In this verse reality, truth, refers to the divine reality.<p>When I was writing the notes on the Epistles of John, I was very exercised over the word truth in John&#8217;s writings. Truth is a crucial word in both the Gospel of John and in his Epistles. As a result of much study, we have come to see that in the writings of John truth refers not to doctrine but to reality.<p>In order to have content, the universe must have a reality. In a similar way, as human beings, vessels created by God, we also need content, reality. This reality is the divine Person, the Triune God. The Triune God is the reality of the universe. Apart from the Triune God, the universe is an empty shell. In the same principle, apart from the Triune God, we also are empty shells. If the universe were merely a shell, there would be nothing but emptiness and vanity. Realizing this, King Solomon said, &#8220;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&#8221; (Eccl. 1:2). Solomon also said that everything under the sun is vanity. It is true that if the Triune God were not the content of the universe and of our being, everything would be empty, vanity.<p>The tabernacle in the Old Testament contained the ark, the incense altar, the lampstand, and the table. In the court of the tabernacle there were the altar of burnt offering and the laver. In addition, there were all the different utensils. Apart from Christ, the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils would have been empty. The same is true of us. God is our reality. Without Him, we are merely empty vessels, empty beings.<p>God is not simple and, as vessels made to contain Him, we are not simple either. According to the entire revelation of the Scriptures, God is triune. Furthermore, we are tripartite; that is, we have a spirit, a soul, and a body. As tripartite beings, we need the Triune God to be our content, our reality.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> </body></html>
