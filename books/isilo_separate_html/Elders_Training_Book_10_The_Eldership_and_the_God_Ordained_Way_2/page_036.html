To teach differently is to teach things different from what the apostles teach, that is, to teach things other than God's New Testament economy (1 Tim. 1:4). This indicates that all the teaching ones should teach the same things in all the churches according to the apostles' teaching. Of course, this indicates also that all the churches should be one in the matter of teaching. This does not mean that in the matter of teaching all the churches should give the same messages and use the same books, even at the same time; it means that all the churches should not teach things that are different from the New Testament revelation of God's New Testament economy. Examples of such teaching are the teaching of the Mosaic law (1 Tim. 1:7) and the teaching of Jewish genealogies (1 Tim. 1:4) by some Christian teachers at Paul's time, which were different from ministering Christ to people according to the proper revelation as taught in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Churches Being the Same<br>in Their Custom and Practice</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Same in Custom</H2><P>All the churches were the same in their customs (1 Cor. 11:16). In 1 Corinthians 11:16, after instructing the saints concerning the matter of head covering, Paul said, "But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God." This indicates that all the churches were the same in their customs. A custom among the churches should not be considered a business affair. Paul told those who would express their opinions in order to dispute with him concerning head covering that the churches did not have the custom of disputation concerning the apostles' teaching. This is not a matter of business; it is a matter of the customs among the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Same in Practice</H2><P>All the churches should be one also in their practice. In 1 Corinthians 14:33-34, concerning women being silent in relation to teaching with authority, Paul said, "As in all the churches of the saints," indicating that all the churches should be the same in not permitting the sisters to teach with authority. This also is not a business affair in the church; it is a practice in the church. In such a practice, all the churches should be one.</P><P>In the churches we practice neither democracy nor autocracy, but theocracy. We all are under the Lord's ruling in everything and in all the practices, following His divine intention according to His holy Word; thus, there is no room for us to express our own human opinions. Unlike the world, the churches should not have the Laodicean practice of deciding matters according to people's opinions, which would often carry the church away from the divine economy to a decision made by a council according to human thought and on a human level. In this matter also all the churches should be the same.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
