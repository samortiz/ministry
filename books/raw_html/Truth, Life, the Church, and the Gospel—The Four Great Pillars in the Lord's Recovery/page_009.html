 <h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY BEING<br />
THE RECOVERY OF THE LIGHT OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of the light of the truth. In the past sixty years the Lord has been opening up the Bible to us day by day, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse. He will continue to do so until all of the truths from Genesis to Revelation are completely transparent, opened, and unveiled to us. We may say that until now there has not been another group of Christians who has spoken on Genesis chapter two and especially on the tree of life as clearly as they have been spoken in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In the same way, today there is no one outside of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery who can speak on the truth in the last two chapters of Revelation regarding the New Jerusalem to the degree of clarity that we have seen and spoken it.</p>
<p>In 1963 I was invited to work in America in eastern Texas. One night after I returned home to my hospitality, I saw a young man, a Southern Baptist believer, who was dedicated to gospel preaching. He was sitting in the study making a telephone call, inviting his friend to come to the meetings. He told the friend that he was attending a preaching meeting with a very unusual message and that he hoped that he would by all means fly over to attend. When I heard this, I shook my head, thinking he was crazy. What surprised me was that on the next evening his friend came from West Texas. That night I spoke on the relationship between the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. After listening, this one was captured by the Lord and confessed that he had never heard this kind of message before. He also stated that he would definitely receive the teaching and take this way. As the next day was the Lord&rsquo;s Day, he had to preach a sermon so he went back to West Texas to fulfill his duty. The following Monday morning he brought his wife. After she heard one message, she also expressed a desire to take this way.</p>
<p>This example shows you that even such an advanced Christian country as America is short of biblical truth. Therefore, the most urgent need on this earth today is the truth of this age. The Lord has placed the responsibility of spreading the truth upon our shoulders. Although we do not have a large number of serving ones, we should each pick up this burden to learn the truth, to preach it everywhere, and to bring ten others into the knowledge of the truth and perfect them to do what we are doing. If we do this, then in three to five years there will be a tremendous multiplication and increase among us. In the Philippines if there were forty thousand who knew the truth and could also explain it to others, then they would be able to spread the truth to the entire country. That would be a glorious sight.</p>
<p>Approximately thirty years ago when the Philippines first came out from under more than forty years of rule by the United States, the English language was still not very common. Now the situation is no longer the same; we see English being taught even in the elementary schools in Mindanao. I truly believe that one day not only the light of the gospel but also the light of the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be spread to all of the Philippines, just like the English language. Even the young ones who are newly saved will be able to utter the truths readily.</p>
<p>What we call the light of the truth is actually the light of the gospel. The so-called gospel that most Christians preach is too shallow and too low. The gospel actually includes all of the truths in the Bible. Today the Bible is published and widely propagated all over the world. Many people have the Bible, but to them it is neither open nor easily understood. When they read it, they use their mind to comprehend it, so there is no way for them to see the spiritual mysteries. Consider Ephesians 5 for example. When people&mdash;whether Christians or unbelievers&mdash;read this chapter they all feel good about it because they consider it a chapter on husbands loving their wives and wives submitting to their husbands (vv. 25, 22). In reality all wives want their husbands to love them and also wish to submit to their husbands. The wives already have these concepts in them; there is no need to read the Bible in order to have such an understanding. Similarly all husbands desire to love their wives, but their greatest problem is that their wives are not submissive. Without being taught by the Bible, the husbands already have these concepts within them.</p>
<p>However, Ephesians 5 not only speaks about these two things, it also reveals a much deeper truth, which is that we must be filled with God in spirit (v. 18). Yet when people read this verse, nearly all of them have their eyes veiled. They do not know what it is to be in spirit and what the spirit is. They also do not know who God is and how God can fill them. This is the kind of understanding that people, including Christians, have of the Bible. They know the superficial word of the Bible, but almost no one apprehends its hidden truths and mysteries.</p>
<p>Most Christians when reading the Bible only see that it teaches people to be forbearing, patient, kind, righteous, and temperate. They consider this kind of teaching to be good and proper and more or less the same as the teachings of the Chinese Confucianists. They are totally ignorant of the revelation in the Bible regarding God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s mysteries. To most people, including the common Christian, the Bible is a closed book. Consider the Gospel of Matthew. Almost no one understands why Matthew chapter one records Christ&rsquo;s genealogy or why it is presented in the way that it is. Thank the Lord that today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the Bible is no longer a closed book. If we would read the Bible along with the life-study messages, we would be able to see the significance of every name. The more we read, the more we will be clear and the more we will have the sense that the entire book has been opened to us. As a result, we will be able to enter into the depths of Matthew and come to the knowledge of the true significance of the divine revelation.</p>
<p>For this reason, I have been encouraging all the saints in America and in Taiwan to spend two hours a day to study the Bible with the help of the life-study messages. In this way, the entire New Testament can be read through in four years. I hope that all of the young people will spend the time. Then in four years you will become excellent Bible teachers, able to present the New Testament clearly and logically and to meet the Lord&rsquo;s great need in every place.</p>
