   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO HAVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A DEFINITE BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN A LOCAL CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; John 21:15; 1 Pet 2:2; 1 Thes 2:7, 11; Eph 4:12</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we want to see how to have a definite beginning of the God-ordained way in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need a definite start, a definite beginning, of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The churches may agree with the God-ordained way, but there has not been much practice of this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is because the traditional way of Christianity, the way of one man speaking and the rest listening, makes people lazy and idle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One speaker is hired to do the work of many.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are only required to give their offerings and listen to some speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But to take the God-ordained way makes everyone busy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of the believers must be exercised to visit people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The success of this God-ordained way has been fully proven, but there is the need of our faithfulness in offering our body as a living sacrifice to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TO MAKE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CLEAR TO THE CONGREGATION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should take the opportunity to make the God-ordained way clear to the congregation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many printed messages concerning the God-ordained way that we can read and study.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we can take some time in the regular meetings of the church to speak to the saints, making the God-ordained way clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>NOT PUSHING THE CONGREGATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TO TAKE THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not push the congregation to take the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should just present the knowledge of this way to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whether they would take this way immediately or wait is up to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe that at least ten percent of the saints will accept our word and will start to practice the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can go on with these ones.</S>
