   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 5 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:1, 4, 9-10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we considered the significance of the phrase the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ in 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us now go on to consider the word baptism in verse 4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TERMINATION FOR A NEW BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 4 says, John the baptizer came in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we see that John came forth to preach the baptism of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To baptize a person is to bury him in water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a burial is a matter of termination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The best way for something to be terminated is for it to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When those who came to John were baptized, they were buried, terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whoever came to John in genuine repentance would then be baptized by him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The repentant ones were buried in baptism by John.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1:1 we have a beginning, and in 1:4, a termination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is no termination, there cannot be a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why were we baptized after we believed in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were baptized in order to bury our old life, including ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever a person repents and believes in the Lord, we should terminate the old life and old self of that one by baptizing him, by burying him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This termination is for a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE BAPTISM OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mark 1:9 speaks of the baptism of the Lord Jesus: And it came about in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus was willing to be baptized; He was willing to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why was the Lord Jesus baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although in one sense with Him there was nothing that needed to be buried, in particular nothing old, the Lord was nevertheless a man, and as a man He was part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the Lord Jesus did not have anything to do with the old creation, how could He be the Savior of the old creation?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to John 1:1 and 14, the Word, which was God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word flesh is a negative term in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God did not create a flesh; God created a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why, then, does the Gospel of John not say that the Word became man?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 1:14 clearly says not that the Word became a man, but that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Jesus came from Nazareth to John, He had a body of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning this matter, Paul was very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Romans 8:3 he says that Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fallen man had become the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the Lord Jesus had only the likeness of the flesh of sin; He did not have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as the brass serpent lifted up in the wilderness for the redemption of the fallen Israelites had only the likeness, the form, of a serpent but not the nature of a serpent, so the Lord Jesus had only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the nature of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By the time the Lord Jesus became a man, mankind had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, within the Lord Jesus there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although there was no sin in Him, yet His humanity was still in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a matter of His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a matter of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With respect to His deity, there was no need for the Lord Jesus to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But with respect to His humanity, to His being a man among men, there was the need for Him to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus as a man needed to be terminated, to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, the Bible does not say that at the time of His baptism the Lord Jesus repented.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because He had nothing of which to repent, there was no need for Him to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord did not have sin, and He never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because He had neither sin nor sins, He did not need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, He had a humanity that was related to the old creation, and for this reason He needed to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In His baptism the Lord was willing to have Himself put aside.</S>
