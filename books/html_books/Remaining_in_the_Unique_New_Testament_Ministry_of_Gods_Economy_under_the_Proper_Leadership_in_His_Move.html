NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY UNDER THE PROPER LEADERSHIP IN HIS MOVE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. TURNING AWAY FROM THE MINISTRY<br />
VERSUS KEEPING THE WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Remaining in the Apostles&rsquo; Teaching,<br />
the New Testament Ministry</h2>
<p>In his Epistles, especially in 2 Timothy, Paul spoke thoroughly concerning the degradation of the church. He said that all who were in Asia turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). This means that the churches established by Paul in Asia turned away from him. The saints in those churches did not forsake Paul himself; rather, they turned away from his New Testament ministry, the apostles&rsquo; teaching which he preached. All that Paul had preached to them, all that he had nurtured them with, all that he had taught them, and all that he had shown them were completely abandoned by them. The first thing that happened in the degradation of the church was the turning away from the apostles&rsquo; teaching. If all of us today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery did not care for the apostles&rsquo; teaching preached by Brother Watchman Nee and me, the church and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would become degraded. To remain in the apostles&rsquo; teaching is a tremendous grace. (<em>How to Be a Co-worker and an Elder and How to Fulfill Their Obligations,</em> p. 44, Witness Lee)</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 1:15 Paul says, &ldquo;&#133;all who are in Asia turned away from me.&rdquo; Asia was a province of the Roman Empire in Asia Minor, far away from Rome where Paul, who was in prison, was writing his Epistle to Timothy. When Paul said that all who were in Asia turned away from him, this does not indicate that they turned away from the person of Paul because the person of Paul was far away from them. This verse indicates that they all turned away from Paul&rsquo;s ministry. Among the churches in Asia was the church in Ephesus, which was fully established by Paul&rsquo;s ministry as recorded in Acts 19. They received the gospel, the teaching, the edification, and the establishment from the ministry of the Apostle Paul. But by the time Paul was imprisoned in Rome, they had all turned away from his ministry.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s second Epistle to Timothy was written about A.D. 68. About thirty years later, the Lord used John to continue His divine revelation. The Lord came back to all the churches in Asia who had turned away from Paul. Because they turned away from Paul&rsquo;s ministry, the churches in Asia declined into a situation full of degradation. The degradation of the churches in Asia as recorded in Revelation 2 and 3 was due to their turning away from the proper ministry. This degradation began with their losing of the first love toward the Lord, which transpired at Ephesus (2:4), and ended with the lukewarmness (3:16), the Christlessness. The Lord as the Head of the church is standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door (3:20).</p>
<p>In these seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the striking point of the churches&rsquo; degradation was three kinds of teachings: the teaching of Balaam, a Gentile prophet (2:14), the teaching of the Nicolaitans to build the hierarchy (2:15), and the teaching of the woman, the so-called prophetess, Jezebel, full of heresies and fornication (2:20). These three kinds of teachings crept in because they left the teaching of the apostle. Why has Christianity become degraded? Because they turned away from the apostle&rsquo;s teaching. Thus, all the different teachings came in.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3 and 6:3 Paul warned not to teach differently. The saints should teach according to Paul&rsquo;s teaching. Those in Asia definitely turned away from Paul&rsquo;s teaching, and the result of this turning away was that they received three kinds of heretical teachings. The teaching of Balaam to worship the idols, the teaching of the Nicolaitans to build up the hierarchy, even the papal system, and the teaching of Jezebel to bring the leaven of evil, heretical, and pagan things into the fine flour of Christ (Matt. 13:33) came in because the proper teaching was rejected. Within thirty years after Paul&rsquo;s final Epistle to Timothy, these churches had reached such a point of degradation. It is dangerous to leave or turn away from the apostle&rsquo;s teaching, from the apostle&rsquo;s proper revelation.</p>
<p>The Lord came in these seven epistles to judge those degraded churches. His eyes were as a flame of fire (1:14) to observe, search, and enlighten, and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword (1:16), which is His discerning, judging, and slaying word (Heb. 4:12; Eph. 6:17). They turned away from the right word, so the Lord came with this word to judge them. The Lord&rsquo;s feet were like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace (1:15). Brass signifies divine judgment (Exo. 27:1-6). The Lord&rsquo;s coming to the churches in such a way fit in with their turning away from the apostle&rsquo;s teaching and their picking up of different teachings.</p>
<p>One church was unique, and was highly appraised by the Lord&mdash;the church in Philadelphia. The Lord highly appraised them and even appreciated them because they kept the word (3:8). That means they did not turn away from the apostle&rsquo;s proper teaching. Although they were weak, the Lord still appraised them highly, telling them that they had a little power and that they had kept the word.</p>
<p>To turn away from the proper teaching is a terrible thing that will result in degradation and in picking up other teachings. I say this as a warning to those dear ones who would not take the new way. To reject the proper revelation, the proper teaching, of the leaders among you is a dangerous thing. You will open the door for other teachings to come in and suffer degradation. I hope that all of the church people in the recovery would not be followers of those in Asia who turned away from Paul&rsquo;s ministry. Rather, I hope we would follow the pattern of the church in Philadelphia&mdash;keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word even though we only have a little strength. Let us keep the word of the Lord, which is to remain in the teachings of the apostle, to remain in the healthy words, to remain in the unique revelation from the Lord with the proper leadership. Then we are safe. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 7: One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move,</em> pp. 128-130, Witness Lee)</p><h2 class="head2">Being Nourished and Blessed<br />
by Following the Ministry</h2>
<p>With Paul and Timothy we see an excellent pattern. As we have pointed out, Paul told Timothy to lay &ldquo;these things before the brothers,&rdquo; referring to the things which he was writing in this Epistle. However, before Timothy could lay these things before others, he first had to feed on them himself. He had to digest them, assimilate them, and allow them to saturate his inner being. Then he would be able to lay them before the brothers. Today we should follow Timothy&rsquo;s example and lay before the saints the things with which we have been nourished by the Lord through the ministry. How wonderful the church life would be if we all did this! However, if we turn from the ministry and seek to produce something different, we may give place to differing teachings. It was not Timothy&rsquo;s intention to teach anything different from what Paul taught. Rather, he would lay before the brothers what he had received from Paul.</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to say a word concerning my burden in putting out the Life-study Messages. The aim of these messages is to produce groceries for the local churches. My burden is not mainly to &ldquo;cook&rdquo; these spiritual groceries; it is to produce them and supply them to the churches that every local church may be a well-stocked supermarket, filled with a variety of nourishing foods. If the leading ones in a local church lay before the saints the riches contained in the Life-studies, the saints will be abundantly nourished. I have received many letters testifying that this has happened.</p>
<p>It is a fact of history in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that any church which follows the ministry is strong and blessed. But those churches which neglect the ministry and try instead to do something on their own have become a failure. However, in saying these things, I wish to make it very clear that I by no means insist that the churches or the saints read the Life-study Messages. To repeat, my burden is to produce groceries. The churches and the saints are free either to use them or to disregard them. But if the saints cast away the nourishment found in these messages, I wonder what they will feed on. We are what we eat. If we eat the &ldquo;groceries&rdquo; produced in today&rsquo;s religion, we shall be part of religion. Let me say in frankness and honesty that the leading ones need to take &ldquo;these things&rdquo; and lay them before the saints that they may be nourished. (<em>Life-study of 1 Timothy,</em> pp. 70-71, Witness Lee)</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. SPEAKING THE SAME THING ACCORDING TO<br />
THE TASTE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking the Same Thing</h2>
<p>We are here for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I am not doing my own work, and you are not doing your own work. We all are bearing one testimony; we all have our shoulders under the &ldquo;staves&rdquo; of the &ldquo;ark.&rdquo; Since we are all bearing the one testimony, we all should speak the same thing (1 Cor. 1:10). But the speaking in certain places is leading the saints in the direction that is away from the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Such speaking may not be wrong or unscriptural. It may be right and scriptural, but eventually it will lead the saints in a wrong direction.</p>
<p>If we go in a straight line, we shall reach a proper goal. But if our direction is off, eventually we shall reach a goal that is not the goal of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Even after a short period of time, trouble may come to the recovery through your way of speaking scriptural things, that is, through your speaking of good messages. Although there is nothing wrong with your speaking, it may lead others in a wrong direction. If so, eventually that will become a problem to the whole recovery.</p>
<p>The recovery is not merely a local matter. Although the recovery is in your local church, the recovery is universal. If you lead those in your locality in a direction that is off from the recovery, then there will be two directions&mdash;the direction in the recovery as a whole and the direction in your locality. If you teach in a way that leads others in a different direction, some may receive your teaching, but many of those in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will reject it. They will not &ldquo;swallow&rdquo; your teaching.</p>
<p>From experience we know that the one who teaches differently is the first one to be sacrificed. This means that if you teach differently, you run the risk not of sacrificing the recovery but of sacrificing yourself. We all need to practice Paul&rsquo;s word to Timothy: &ldquo;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:3). Instead of teaching differently, we should all speak the same thing.</p>
<p>Since I am the one who has given the Life-study Messages, it is rather awkward for me to speak about them. However, I can say that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been going on by the ministry. If the ministry had not come to this country, the recovery would not be prevailing here. The recovery came through the ministry, and the recovery has been going on by the ministry. If you, then, speak something that is off from the ministry, surely the recovery will not follow that speaking. It is a dream to think that the entire recovery will follow the speaking that is different from that of the ministry. Therefore, if you speak differently, you will exclude yourself from the recovery by your speaking. No one else will exclude you; you will be excluded by your own speaking, concept, and attitude.</p>
<p>It is no doubt true that every local church has its own jurisdiction. However, we have taught very strongly that each local church is not a Body of Christ; all the churches together are the one Body. Because of this, what happens in one place will affect other places. This means that what you do in your locality will affect the other local churches. News travels quickly from one place to another. Also, the saints who are now in your locality later may move to a different locality.</p>
<p>Those who teach differently are not able to stop the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The ministry brought the recovery to this country, and the ministry is still carrying the recovery. How can the ministry receive dissenting teachings? Those who teach differently will cause trouble first to themselves and then to others and to the recovery. They will damage others and then cause damage to the recovery. Such damage is the responsibility of those who teach differently.</p>
<p>We all need to consider what we minister, preach, and teach. This means that we need to take care of all the churches. Before the Lord I can testify that this was my practice in China, and it is my practice today. When I was in China speaking in a certain locality, I considered how the other churches might be affected by my speaking. I asked myself, &ldquo;Will this cause trouble to the other churches? How will it affect them? Will the entire recovery be able to accept this?&rdquo; I realized that if I did not consider my speaking in this way, I could cause trouble. I could speak something that the recovery as a whole would not receive. I could speak something that others would reject because it was contrary to their taste.</p><h2 class="head2">A Taste for the Ministry</h2>
<p>Just as people have different tastes in food, so the Lord&rsquo;s recovery also has a taste for the ministry that has built up the recovery over the years. The recovery was raised up with a certain taste. Those who have been raised with this taste will reject a taste that is contrary to it. This means that if you speak something contrary to the taste of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, your speaking will be rejected, and you will be the first to suffer loss. We have seen a number of examples of this in the past.</p>
<p>In 1964 I invited a certain brother to share a message in one session each day of a training. That brother&rsquo;s teaching was very good. Otherwise, I would not have asked him to share that training with me. However, the speaking of that brother went against the taste of the saints. One brother told me that this brother&rsquo;s teaching was too philosophical. This indicates that even though the recovery had been in this country less than two years, the saints had already acquired a taste for life.</p>
<p>Concerning a matter such as this, it is useless to argue about who is right and who is wrong. The point here is that saints have a taste, and they do not accept what is contrary to it. Let me give you an illustration of what I mean by a taste for the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. One day I encouraged a brother to try eating sea cucumber, a Chinese dish that I enjoy very much. Even though the sea cucumber had been prepared by an expert cook and I had strongly recommended it, the brother refused to eat it, because it was contrary to his taste in food. Likewise, you may think that your speaking is good, but it is not according to the taste in the recovery.</p>
<p>If you are wise you will know the taste of those to whom you are speaking. All the churches in the recovery were raised up through the ministry, and the saints have been &ldquo;eating&rdquo; this ministry for years and have a taste for it. Even though no churches have been produced by your speaking, you now begin to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; the saints with something different from the ministry, with something that is not according to their taste. If you do this, you will cause trouble for yourself. Just as parents will have trouble with their children if they force them to eat food that is contrary to their taste, so you will have trouble if you expect the saints to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; something against the taste in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Those who teach differently are not wise, for they do not know the environment, situation, and condition of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been raised up in a particular way. Brothers who teach differently actually are trying to bring in a foreign element; they are trying to wedge in a foreign particle into the &ldquo;body&rdquo; of the recovery. The recovery will not accept any kind of foreign element or article. As we have strongly emphasized, the reason is that the saints have their taste.</p>
<p>Although the recovery is not controlled by any person, there is a controlling factor in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and this factor is the taste in the recovery. The recovery has a particular taste because it has a certain life that came from its birth. Just as a human being is born with a life that gives him a certain taste, so the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was born with the life that has its own particular taste. This taste is the controlling factor in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. No one can overthrow this controlling factor. If you try to overthrow it, you yourself will be overthrown. This means that you actually overthrow yourself, causing yourself to be separated from the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>I do not insist that all the churches use the Life-study Messages. However, I wish to point out that this ministry brought the recovery to this country and has been helping and nourishing the recovery. The recovery has grown up with the &ldquo;food&rdquo; provided by this ministry. Now it is impossible for the saints to change their taste. If you try to change the taste of the saints, you will be foolish, you will waste your time, and you will cause damage. If you feel that your teaching is better than that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, you should serve your &ldquo;food&rdquo; to those who have a taste for it. Those who have been raised on certain foods may occasionally eat something different. But for the long run in their daily living they will eat what matches their taste and reject what is contrary to it.</p>
<p>Since this is the situation among the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should be wise to learn the basic truths and then serve these truths to the saints. If we do this, everyone will be happy, and we shall have a peaceful situation not only among individual saints but also between the churches and between the churches and the ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Nature of the New Testament Ministry</h2>
<p>If you can give messages that fit the taste of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery without using the Life-study Messages, that would be wonderful. Such messages will be profitable to the recovery. Messages that fit the taste of the recovery are truly part of the New Testament ministry. No one should think that only what I minister is the New Testament ministry. Paul, of course, ministered the New Testament ministry. Martin Luther also ministered a part of the New Testament ministry. Many among us also minister the ministry of the New Testament.</p>
<p>Whatever we minister must be of the nature of the New Testament ministry. Whether or not a particular ministry is part of the New Testament ministry can be proved by applying three governing principles: one, the principle of the processed Triune God being dispensed into His chosen people; second, the principle of Christ and the church; and third, the principle of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. If your teaching can pass this threefold test, your teaching is part of the New Testament ministry. Any ministry that is part of the New Testament ministry will be welcomed by the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Any other ministry, however, will only cause trouble for the recovery. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 3: The Way to Carry Out the Vision,</em> pp. 127-132, Witness Lee)</p><h2 class="head1">III. TEACHING DIFFERENT THINGS<br />
FROM THE UNIQUE MINISTRY OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />
CREATING DIVISION AND DESTROYING THE RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Throughout the twenty centuries of church history, the divisions, confusions, and problems which have taken place among all the Christians were all due to a ministry. Whatever you minister produces something. If you minister the heavens, something heavenly will be produced. If you minister earthly things, surely the issue, the coming out, will be earthly. The many divisions and confusions among the Christians today all come from one source&mdash;a ministry. The Presbyterian denomination or division came out of the ministry of the presbytery. The Baptist division came out of the ministry of baptism by immersion. All the different kinds of Christian groups come out of different ministries. A ministry is mainly a teaching. We must realize that the teaching which a Christian teaches ministers something. It may minister something right, something wrong, something high, or something low. A teaching always issues in something. Based upon the issue of your teaching, your teaching may be considered as a ministry. Ministry in the biblical usage means to serve people with something, just as a waiter in a restaurant serves people with the courses of food. To serve others with something is to minister. To minister is not to preach, teach, or speak without serving anyone with anything. We may say that a certain minister who speaks for an hour ministers nothing to people. This means that according to Christ he ministered nothing, but according to the facts that minister did minister something. He ministered something wrong, something bad, or something low to people. I hope we can see that ministry produces problems, ministry produces division, and ministry produces confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not to Teach Differently</h2>
<p>This is why Paul wrote 1 Timothy in the midst of a confusing environment and after many years of his work with his co-workers. This Epistle is altogether an inoculation. Poison after poison was injected into the Christian church while the church was going on. At the conclusion of his writing ministry, Paul wrote 1 Timothy to inoculate the church against all these poisons. In the opening word of this Epistle, however, Paul did not write in a way that we would think to be so serious: &ldquo;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently (1:3).&rdquo; This phrase &ldquo;not to teach differently&rdquo; seems so simple. If you merely read this phrase, you will not sense the seriousness of different teaching. We may not think that this is serious, but actually it is more than serious. It kills people to teach differently. To teach differently tears down God&rsquo;s building and annuls God&rsquo;s entire economy. We all must realize that even a small amount of teaching in a different way destroys the recovery. There is a proverb which says, &ldquo;One sentence can build up the nation and one sentence can destroy the entire nation.&rdquo; You do not need to give an entire message. Just by speaking one sentence which conveys your kind of concept tears down everything. We must realize that ministry is &ldquo;terrible.&rdquo; Your speaking can build up or destroy. It is possible that your speaking destroys, kills, and annuls.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Unique Ministry</h2>
<p>As we have seen, Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 1:3 that he left him there in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently. What then, we may ask, is the unique thing which all the Christian teachers should teach? Christian teachers today teach many things such as the presbytery, baptism by immersion, the episcopalian way, holiness, how to preach the gospel, and the way to teach the Bible. We would all agree that to teach the way of Judaism is surely wrong, but what about teaching how to preach the gospel? What is wrong with preaching the gospel? We must realize that even the teaching to preach the gospel creates division. This is wrong. There is only one ministry which always builds up, edifies, and perfects with no destruction at all. There is only one unique ministry that is justified, promoted, uplifted, and even glorified in the New Testament. In 1 Timothy 1:4 Paul went on to tell Timothy what those ones who were teaching differently should be occupied with&mdash;God&rsquo;s economy. Through my contact with some of you brothers, I became burdened and made a quick decision to call this gathering for this training. I do not like to see the recovery destroyed by different teachings. I realize the real situation. The Lord covers me. You may not know what I am talking about because you do not know all the factors. My contact with some of you impressed me with a terrible factor. I realized that you were going to teach things differently to cause trouble and to create division. There is only one ministry that ever builds up and that never destroys&mdash;this is God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves what was wrong with teaching Judaism at the Apostle&rsquo;s time. This is not Buddhism or Gnosticism. To teach Judaism is to teach according to the holy Word in the Old Testament. Someone could have said to the Apostle Paul, &ldquo;What is wrong with teaching the law? I am teaching the Bible.&rdquo; Is there anything wrong with teaching people the Bible, with teaching people theology, or with teaching people how to preach the gospel? There is nothing wrong, but we must realize that this kind of teaching creates division. In 1 Timothy Paul did not indicate that those who taught differently taught heresies or heathen things. If they had taught heathen things, no Christian would have taken them. The reason why their teachings were received is because they were scriptural things from the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament. By that time the New Testament had not yet come into existence. The holy Word was only the Old Testament. These ones who taught differently could have thought, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t allow me to teach the Old Testament, then what am I going to teach? I am quite legitimate and quite scriptural.&rdquo; Their teaching, however, created division. Is there anything wrong with setting up a mission and sending missionaries to the field? We must realize that this is not a matter of being wrong or right, but it is a matter of &ldquo;cutting Christ&rsquo;s Body into pieces.&rdquo; On the one hand, the bringing of people to Christ through the missionaries is very positive. Unconsciously, however, this kind of work cuts Christ&rsquo;s Body into pieces. We should be careful because we may do the same thing. We may insist, stress, and emphasize a scriptural item which seemingly is right, yet actually it cuts the Body of Christ. It divides the recovery. We must be careful. I called such a gathering because I read people&rsquo;s hearts from their attitude and from their spirit in speaking. I am afraid that some different teachings might be on the verge of coming out.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Testament Ministry</h2>
<p>The only way that can preserve us in the recovery is the unique ministry. If we say that we are in the recovery, yet we teach something so lightly, even in a concealed way, that is different from God&rsquo;s economy, we sow the seed that will grow up in division. Therefore, the only way that we can be preserved in the eternal oneness is to teach the same thing in God&rsquo;s economy. This kind of teaching is called the New Testament ministry, the ministry of the new covenant. The ministry of the new covenant is only to minister the Triune God, processed, to be dispensed into His chosen people as life and life supply to produce members of Christ to form the Body to express the Triune God. This is the New Testament economy. To teach anything, even good things and scriptural things, which is even a little bit apart from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy will still issue in division and that will be very much used by the subtle one, the evil one. We must, therefore, be on the alert. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 3: The Way to Carry Out the Vision,</em> pp. 41-46, 48-49, Witness Lee)</p><h2 class="head2">Divisions Coming out of Different Ministries</h2>
<p>We need to be very clear that the foundation of all the denominations and the factor that produces each denomination are their different ministries. If all the Christians today would be willing for the Lord to take away their different ministries, they would all be one. The basic factor of all the divisions, their very root, is different ministries. Ministries that are different may be very sound, even very scriptural, but they are something Paul said was creeping in at the time of Galatians 2 (v. 4, lit.). This thing crept in as early as the time of Paul. Paul, Peter, and James were all there, and a ministry of another kind was trying to come in. In 1 Timothy 1 Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to take care of one thing: to charge certain ones not to teach differently, which means not to teach according to another ministry (vv. 3-4). At that time the different teaching was the teaching of the law. In Galatians 2 what was trying to creep in was the law.</p>
<p>At a later time, the heretical teaching of Gnosticism came in. Gnosticism was heresy, but you cannot say that to teach something of the Old Testament was heretical. At this point we need to consider that whole situation carefully. Paul was carrying out God&rsquo;s New Testament ministry and his ministry followed Peter&rsquo;s ministry, which was an immediate continuation of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Himself. In the four Gospels Jesus Christ carried out God&rsquo;s ministry, and in the first part of Acts, Peter continued that ministry. Then in the second part of Acts, Paul&rsquo;s ministry was a continuation of Peter&rsquo;s to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament ministry. Nevertheless, when the Judaizing believers were strong in teaching the law, Peter became weak. Peter was afraid of those who came down from James (Gal. 2:11-12). This also indicates that James was a strong figure, a strong character, in tolerating the teaching of the law in the New Testament age.</p>
<p>Can you imagine Paul facing that problem? In Antioch Paul was facing the number one apostle, Peter, and he was facing representatives of the most influential apostle, James. It was not easy for Paul to face that situation. Two strong influences were there, the influence of Peter and the influence of James. Peter could have said to Paul, &ldquo;Who are you, Saul of Tarsus? When I was speaking there in Jerusalem, you were still a young man opposing. Who do you think you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, Paul was facing the representatives of James, a godly man who prayed so much, day after day, that there are reports that his two knees were calloused. James was famous for his godly perfection and was very influential. He became even more influential than the great first apostle, Peter. Peter was afraid of his influence. In Antioch Peter was eating with the Gentiles peacefully. However, when some representatives came from James, Peter became a hypocrite and pretended that he had not eaten with the Gentiles. This indicates how strong James&rsquo; influence was.</p>
<p>Paul, as a younger apostle who had come later than Peter, was facing such a situation. Undoubtedly, it was hard for him. Nevertheless, for the sake of the truth, Paul did not tolerate that situation. He did not allow such a thing. He cut off the different ministries. He closed the door for the different ministries to creep in, and God honored what Paul did in that situation.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament and according to church history, from that time onward Peter did not play an important role in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, not as important as the role he played in the first twelve chapters of Acts. This is an important point. After not too long a time, in A.D. 70, God destroyed Jerusalem (Matt. 24:1-2), which was the base of Peter&rsquo;s work and the base of James&rsquo; influence. He tore down the whole thing, leaving no stone upon another, destroying it. Not only was that a judgment on the rebellious Israel, but it was also the destruction of the base of Peter&rsquo;s work and of James&rsquo; influence. After the destruction that took place in A.D. 70, however, Paul&rsquo;s ministry and his influence remained. God did not allow different ministries and other influences.</p>
<p>We need to see this principle throughout the entire Christian era. All the troubles, divisions, and confusions came from the one source of the tolerance of different ministries. Many Christian teachers have known the peril of different ministries; nevertheless, they have tolerated them. There has been a tolerance of different ministries. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, for the long run, we should not believe that this kind of creeping in of the different ministries would never take place. Rather, we must be on the alert. Such a peril is ahead of us. If we are not watchful, if we are careless, in one way or another the enemy would creepingly use some means, some ways, to bring in different ministries. Such a thing would end the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>If you look at today&rsquo;s situation, you will realize that there are many different ministries in addition to this unique New Testament ministry. If you could take away all the different ministries and leave only the unique ministry of the New Testament, all the denominations, all the different groups, and all the divisions, would disappear. There would be no division and no confusion.</p>
<p>All of us need to learn this sober lesson and be on the alert not to deviate from the ministry of the New Testament. If we carry out something new, something different, something other than this unique ministry, we will be through as far as the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is concerned. Actually, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to bring us back to the unique ministry of the New Testament. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 1: The Ministry of the New Testament,</em> pp. 14-16, 72, Witness Lee)</p><h2 class="head1">IV. LESSONS CONCERNING THE ONENESS<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY</h2>
<p>At this point we need to spend some time to be brought into the New Testament ministry so that we may see this ministry from the beginning to the end of the New Testament. It is crucial for us to see what the New Testament ministry is. We have already pointed out that the New Testament ministry began with John the Baptist. However, we should not consider his ministry a separate, individualistic ministry. The ministry of John the Baptist was a part of the New Testament ministry. It was a service of the New Testament ministry, even the first service of that ministry. We need to look into this ministry in a particular way to pick up a crucial point.</p>
<p>When we come to the Lord&rsquo;s appraisal of His forerunner&rsquo;s ministry in Matthew 11, we can see that even that first service, that first part of the New Testament ministry, was a unique ministry. John&rsquo;s ministry of repentance, the way of repentance, was a very striking ministry that drew the line between the Old Testament and the New Testament. That ministry was a landmark in God&rsquo;s economy. Nevertheless, John&rsquo;s ministry should not be considered as a separate, independent, individualistic ministry. If you had such a consideration, you would become what the Gospels call the disciples of John.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Rivalry to the Lord&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>In Matthew 9 the disciples of John came to question the Lord Jesus, and they included the Pharisees along with themselves in their question (v. 14). According to Luke 5, it was the Pharisees who did the questioning (v. 33), and according to Mark 2, it seems that the disciples of John and the Pharisees questioned the Lord together (v. 18). Before that time, the Pharisees were one sect, and there was another sect, a heretical sect, called the Sadducees. However, at the time of Matthew 9 the disciples of John became yet another sect. From this we can see that probably not more than two or three years after John began to preach, his service caused trouble and became a rivalry to the Lord&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>God did not intend that John&rsquo;s service would become a separate ministry. In God&rsquo;s intention, John&rsquo;s service was simply the beginning of the New Testament ministry, a recommending service that initiated the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. John told us clearly what his ministry was (John 1:23; 3:28-30), but his disciples understood in a wrong way. They thought that their teacher, John the Baptist, was great and that his teaching was unique. They followed him, and they followed his teaching. Perhaps unconsciously and unintentionally, they became a rivalry to the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. Eventually that preaching became something replacing the Lord&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>Quite often we fail to recognize the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty in the things that happened to John the Baptist. First Herod put John into prison, and then, due to Herod&rsquo;s indulgence in lust, he had John beheaded. However, we need to realize that for John to be put into prison was sovereign of the Lord, and even for John to be beheaded was sovereign of the Lord. I certainly do not mean to say that God was happy to see John imprisoned, much less to see him beheaded. Nevertheless, we must believe that God is sovereign, and we need to consider soberly why God allowed John to be imprisoned and later beheaded.</p>
<p>The imprisonment and execution of John came about because there was a care for another ministry. John&rsquo;s ministry and his disciples caused some trouble. First, God stopped John&rsquo;s preaching through Herod. Then even from the prison John sent his disciples to the Lord Jesus with certain questions. Right after that, John suffered martyrdom. God was sovereign to terminate what was there with John at that time. Of course, that termination was not a good or positive termination.</p>
<p>The case of John the Baptist shows us that there is a peril that we may receive a genuine ministry, a genuine service from God, and yet we would not be willing to see that service terminated. This is a crucial point. God may use you, and He may use me. He may use us for a certain service with a view to His purpose, but after we have been used by Him, probably none of us would be willing to see the termination of that service.</p>
<p>The same principle can be applied in the case of Moses. The account of the shining of Moses&rsquo; face in Exodus 34 does not tell us why Moses covered his face with a veil (vv. 30-35). However, according to Paul&rsquo;s interpretation in 2 Corinthians 3:13, Moses was afraid that the people would see the termination of his ministry. Moses did not want the people to see the shining of his ministry come to an end. Even in his case there was a consideration about the termination of his ministry. We all are happy to be used by the Lord in a certain service, but none of us would be willing to see that service come to an end.</p>
<p>It was this kind of trouble that forced God, the sovereign One, to allow John to be imprisoned and even to have his life terminated. We need to consider this whole matter carefully. Without God&rsquo;s sovereignty to allow things to be carried out in this way, surely the teaching of John would have been taken over by his disciples and would have created a big problem. Here we need to learn the lesson. God would not allow any ministry, any service, to remain in a rivalry with His New Testament ministry. What happened in the case of John the Baptist sovereignly cleared up the whole situation. For the rest of the time of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, there was no rivalry, but there was opposition. Opposition is comparatively easy to deal with, but it is very hard to deal with rivalry.</p>
<p>God tolerated the opposition from the Pharisees for a longer time, at least up until A.D. 70, when Jerusalem was destroyed. The Lord even prophesied that not one stone of the temple in Jerusalem would be left upon another because of their opposition, their rejection of Him, and He indicated that the temple of God had become their house because they had made it a den of robbers (Matt. 24:1-2; 23:38). The Lord tolerated the opposition for a number of years, but He did not tolerate the rivalry. Immediately John was put into prison, and his life was terminated. We need to learn the lesson from this case. This matter is something of the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p><h2 class="head2">The Continuation of the<br />
New Testament Ministry with Peter</h2>
<p>After John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus continued God&rsquo;s New Testament ministry, and He thoroughly accomplished that part of the ministry. Then the day of Pentecost came. On that day Peter was strong, and he was pure in every way. In chapters two through five of Acts we can see a young man, probably still in his thirties, clean and very pure in every way, in intent, in desire, in motive, in the heart, in the spirit, and in the understanding. He had no consideration about anything other than the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, even no consideration about his life. With him at that time there was no problem in any point.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Peter and the Old Testament Way</h2>
<p>However, in Acts 10 Peter&rsquo;s attitude caused a problem for God; it troubled Him. In Matthew 16 the Lord told Peter that He would give him the keys of the kingdom. There are at least two keys because the word keys is plural. On the day of Pentecost Peter used one of the two keys to open the gate for the Jewish people to enter into God&rsquo;s New Testament kingdom. However, when God was going on to use him with the second key to open the door for the Gentiles this contradicted Peter&rsquo;s background and tradition. On the day of Pentecost all that was necessary was for the Holy Spirit to descend upon Peter, but for the house of Cornelius God used two visions, one vision to Peter and another vision to Cornelius. This indicates that God was troubled because He was forced to take the Old Testament way of visions and dreams.</p>
<p>The New Testament way is to follow the anointing within, to follow the indwelling Spirit. Peter had the Spirit dwelling within him inwardly, but he could not understand the indwelling because of his background and his tradition. Peter had the outward outpouring of the Spirit and also the inward indwelling of the Spirit, but he could not understand the indwelling. This is a crucial point.</p>
<p>To carry out God&rsquo;s ministry there is the need of a clean person. How clean Peter was on the day of Pentecost and in chapters two through five of Acts! Nothing was there as a veil covering him, and he was absolutely pure as crystal. But after a short time, even when he was praying in Acts 10, there was a veil covering him. That veil was tradition and his Jewish background, covering him and keeping him from the New Testament way. Nevertheless, God overcame him, subdued him, and even convinced him to go to the house of Cornelius to use the second key to open the door for the Gentiles to come in.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Termination of Peter&rsquo;s Ministry in Acts</h2>
<p>We need to read and reread Acts with much consideration. After Peter used the second key, Acts 12 tells us that he was put into prison, and then released from prison. Nevertheless, after Acts 12 there is nothing in Acts 13 concerning Peter. Chapters thirteen through twenty-eight are for Paul, and in Acts there are no more chapters for Peter. Peter&rsquo;s ministry was finished in the New Testament ministry of God in Acts. Peter was good, and I believe he wrote both his Epistles after this time. (The date of 1 Peter is uncertain, whether before or after the time of Acts 13.) It was very good that Peter wrote those two Epistles. Especially in the second one, he was very genuine and bold, because he recommended one who had rebuked him to his face (2 Pet. 3:15-16).</p>
<p>After Acts 12, we do not see Peter until chapter fifteen. However, in Acts 15 Peter was no longer the first among the apostles nor even the first among the elders in Jerusalem. At that time in Jerusalem the atmosphere, the tendency, and the influence were not in favor of Peter, but were altogether in favor of James, who somewhat might be considered a semi-New Testament apostle, a great part New Testament and some part Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Elements of Mixture</h2>
<p>Something colored gray can blend in either with something colored white or with something colored black. James can be compared to something colored gray, something that can fit in with either side. Peter should have been compared to something pure white, but he did not dare to be what he was. Under that atmosphere, influence, and tendency, what Peter was would not have been welcome. However, James was welcome because he could fit in with two sides at the same time.</p>
<p>From what we have seen in the Life-studies of James and Mark, we can realize that even the situation in Acts 15 was not entirely pure. We need to see the decision that was made in Acts 15 in the light of what happened in Acts 21. Although &ldquo;it seemed good to the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 28), that decision was made mainly under James&rsquo;s influence, and it was not purely according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. What happened in chapter twenty-one came out of the decision that was made in chapter fifteen. In other words, we could say that the weakness that was there in chapter fifteen was exposed in chapter twenty-one. In Acts 21 James was very bold to declare that there were tens of thousands of Jewish believers in Jerusalem zealous for the law (v. 20). James was even so bold that he advised Paul to take the same way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Turn of Paul&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>We may say that Paul became weak in Acts 21 and followed the advice of James. Some may argue that Paul was not weak, but that he was very strong to keep his word that to the Jews he became a Jew (1 Cor. 9:20). They may excuse Paul, but the Lord did not allow him such an excuse. We know the Lord did not excuse Paul because on the last day of the vow that Paul had agreed to participate in, He brought the whole thing to an end. Paul had paid the charges for the poor votaries, and with just one more day they could have completed the vow. However, the Lord did not allow such a thing. As a result, all of Jerusalem was brought into an uproar, and Paul was arrested and put into prison.</p>
<p>This matter is very serious. Even Paul&rsquo;s ministry was turned at this point because there was some involvement there. We should not get ourselves involved in things of this kind. It is altogether a serious matter to weaken God&rsquo;s economy or to make it gray. As for Paul, he was pure, and God was, therefore, able to use him in another way, to write the Epistles. It was very good for Paul to write the Epistles, such as Ephesians, Philippians, and the others written while he was imprisoned. Nevertheless, the writing of these Epistles was all of Paul&rsquo;s ministry after Acts 21. These are serious matters.</p><h2 class="head2">The Case of Barnabas</h2>
<p>We need to go back to consider something concerning the case of Barnabas. He was faithful, and he was the one who brought Paul in (Acts 9:27). He was also a companion apostle to Paul. However, he had an opinion. To us, that was not a serious matter. Surely Barnabas was not a Judaizer, but because of his opinion, he took his way to carry out the so-called ministry. That was the termination of the record concerning Barnabas in the book of Acts. Not only in the Bible, even in history it is hard to trace any record concerning Barnabas after this point. What a sober word this is for us today!</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problem of Apollos&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>Then at the end of Acts 18, Apollos came in. He came neither from the source of Peter nor from the source of Paul, but from some other source. We cannot trace from what source Apollos came, but he appeared in chapter eighteen, teaching the Scriptures and knowing only the baptism of John (Acts 18:24-28). It was necessary for Apollos to be merged in with Paul&rsquo;s ministry, the more the better. Although he may have been very much one with Paul, his case became a problem.</p>
<p>In Corinth Apollos became a problem, and Peter became a problem. I could not find out whether or not Peter himself had ever gone to Corinth. However, his ministry became a problem there, not because of Peter, but simply because there was such a thing as Peter&rsquo;s ministry. There was a following of Peter&rsquo;s ministry since there were those who said, &ldquo;I am of Peter&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:12). Apollos was also there, and there were those who said, &ldquo;I am of Apollos.&rdquo; I do not believe that Apollos had any intention to cause trouble, but the trouble came, not because of Apollos, but because of his ministry and its following. Paul was a man in the Spirit, and he did not condemn Peter, nor did he condemn Apollos. Rather, in speaking things negatively, he mentioned his own name first (1 Cor. 1:12). We need to consider these matters carefully to see the peril that is before us today. In Corinth, Peter&rsquo;s ministry and its following and Apollos&rsquo;s ministry and its following created a problem that almost caused a division.</p>
<p>Suppose I were Apollos. In such a case, do you think the Lord would use me more and more? If I had a ministry that was used as Apollos&rsquo;s, do you think that my usefulness to the Lord would be increasing all the time? Paul&rsquo;s ministry was never used in that way. His ministry was the major item in God&rsquo;s New Testament ministry. Such was not the case with the ministry of Apollos.</p>
<p>In any case, at Corinth there were problems due to these three kinds of service, that of Peter, of Apollos, and of Paul. I do not believe that Apollos conducted himself in a way to be one with Paul to the uttermost in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (see 1 Cor. 16:12). He was not divisive, and he did not separate himself from God&rsquo;s New Testament ministry. Nevertheless, we could not see in the Scriptures that Apollos was one hundred percent one with Paul in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Personal Testimony</h2>
<p>Allow me to testify something from my experience in working with Brother Watchman Nee. I worked with Brother Nee for over eighteen years. There are some among us who were there at that time and did see the situation. Since the beginning of Brother Nee&rsquo;s work, a number of prominent Christians who later became famous preachers were there with Brother Nee for a time. The first meeting of the Lord&rsquo;s table in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery took place with Brother Nee and another brother and his wife. These were the three who initiated the Lord&rsquo;s table meetings in the recovery. Eventually that brother became a problem to Brother Nee because he was not one with him in God&rsquo;s move at that time in China. From that time on, one prominent brother after another came in to the recovery there in China. Nearly all of them became problems to Brother Nee. If I had taken the same attitude as the others, surely I would have become a problem to him also. However, all realized that I was one thousand percent one with Brother Nee in his ministry because my standing, my attitude, and my spirit were altogether one with him. No opening was left for anyone to say that I was a problem to Brother Nee. There was no ground for such a charge.</p>
<p>If someone is able to ask you whether or not you are one with me, that question is a hint that you are not one hundred percent one with me. If water can leak through a roof when it rains, that surely means there is a crack somewhere in the roof. If there is no crack, no water could leak in. If you are thoroughly one hundred percent one with me, we are like a roof that has no crack for the rain to come in. When it rains, the water both testifies and tests whether or not there is a crack in the roof. If there is a leak, this is a proof that a crack is there.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problem in Corinth and the Peril Today</h2>
<p>We need to read the facts in the Bible, not merely the letters in black and white. There was a reason for the problem in Corinth where some said, &ldquo;I am of Cephas,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am of Paul.&rdquo; If Peter had behaved, acted, and worked in an atmosphere, in color, and in flavor absolutely one with Paul, no one at Corinth would have said that he was of Peter and not of Paul. If Apollos had been working, preaching, moving, and living in a way that was with the flavor, the color, and the atmosphere that absolutely matched that of Paul, no one would have said that he was of Apollos and not of Paul. There were three entities there. One was of Peter, one was of Apollos, and one was of Paul.</p>
<p>Whether you call them three ministries, three leaders, three headships, or three different kinds of teaching, the fact that there were three created a leak for the rain to come in, and the rain did come in. Some were saying, &ldquo;I am of Peter. I don&rsquo;t care for Paul.&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;I am of Apollos. I don&rsquo;t care for Peter or for Paul.&rdquo; Still others said, &ldquo;I am for Paul.&rdquo; Therefore, in Corinth there was fighting among the saints that came from the different flavors, different colors, and different atmospheres of the so-called ministers. If Peter, Apollos, and Paul were working, moving, and walking in one atmosphere, in one color, and in one flavor, I do not believe anything could ever happen in Corinth that would cause the people to say that they were of this one or of that one. Such a thing could happen there simply because the atmosphere, the flavor, the color, and the spirit among the three were not one.</p>
<p>Then how about our situation today? We need to consider our present situation soberly according to this light from the Scriptures. Again I say that I would have much more liberty to speak concerning these matters if Brother Nee were working among us. If this were the case, he would be the target instead of me. Because I am the target now, it is hard for me to speak concerning certain matters, lest whatever I say be considered a self-vindication.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all of us need to realize that we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The first characteristic of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is oneness. Once we lose the oneness, we are through. If we lose the oneness, we are no longer the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Therefore, we need to see that there is a peril of different teachings and different opinions damaging the oneness. I thank the Lord for His mercy that since the beginning of His recovery in this country I have never been so cautious in any other matter as I have in this one matter. In all these twenty-three years it has been my practice to exercise myself never to debate with any of the brothers concerning doctrines or concerning opinions. Six years ago some very serious problems arose among us. During that time, you probably did not hear me say anything concerning these problems because I did not want to give any impression that I was open to debate concerning the opinions and doctrines of others. However, this did not mean that I agreed with those opinions and doctrines. Now I realize that the more we are going on, the more we are in a trend with a peril that opinions and different teachings may come in. Opinions may be good, and teachings may be scriptural, yet they may be different. Sooner or later, these matters will create a hidden division. The blessing that always comes down from God to His recovery is based upon the oneness (Psa. 133). If we lose the oneness, we will lose the blessing.</p>
<p>I believe that we can learn from Apollos&rsquo;s case that there is the possibility of having different flavors, different atmospheres, and different colors, although we may move together, minister together, work together, and all be together in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Apollos was not dissenting with Paul, but his ministry bore a different color and flavor than Paul&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>I am not saying that something has already happened among us to create a problem. No storm has come, but a weather report has. In the climate of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, there are some signs that some storms may come if we do not exercise our carefulness. For this reason, I am burdened to present the real situation to you in order that you may realize that there is a peril ahead of us. Even though we are not in any storm yet, I do feel the need to send out the weather report to let you know that there is the possibility of storms coming in this climate if we are careless. I hope we would not have a repetition of the storms that came six years ago. I believe all of us have a good intention. I do not believe there is anyone among us with a wrong intention. Nevertheless, the things we do could be wrong even though our intention is not wrong. All of us need to be careful. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 1: The Ministry of the New Testament,</em> pp. 19-30, Witness Lee)</p><h2 class="head1">V. NO UNCERTAIN SOUNDING OF THE TRUMPET IN THE LORD&rsquo;S MINISTRY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;For also if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Ministry&mdash;<br />
the Sounding of the Trumpet<br />
for the Army to Go to War</h2>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s word to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 14:8, he was referring to the matter of speaking in tongues with a definite interpretation. He said that if there is not a definite interpretation of a person&rsquo;s tongue-speaking, this is like sounding the trumpet with an uncertain sound. We may think an item like tongue speaking is too small for our consideration. As we have seen, another item that has been sounded is that there are two lines in the recovery. We may think that these are small things which are not related to the Lord&rsquo;s Person, to His deity, to His divinity, or to His Godhead. Speaking in tongues with or without a definite interpretation and some feeling that there are two lines in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery may be considered by some as minor things which are not related to the major items in the divine revelation. They have nothing to do with the Lord&rsquo;s headship or with the Lord&rsquo;s redemptive work. They are not something modernistic which deny the authority of the Bible or deny God&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>Some of the so-called workers, the leading ones, like to think that they can take another line, not following the one line in the ministry. They may consider this and speaking in tongues without a definite interpretation small matters which we do not need to pay attention to. To some extent I myself have had this kind of thought in the past. Although I gave such a serious word that my toleration is over, some brothers may feel, not in a negative way, but in a very positive way concerning me, that they love me and do not think that I need to be that serious about little things such as these. I had the same kind of thought in the past, but through my study I realized that in the New Testament the illustration of a trumpet being sounded to prepare others for battle is only used in 1 Corinthians. This illustration in 1 Corinthians is not used in relation to the person of Christ in His Godhead or to the crucial, eternal redemption of Christ. This illustration is used concerning a minor point, the interpretation of tongues.</p>
<p>Let us read 1 Corinthians 14:6-8 to see the context of this illustration: &ldquo;But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching? Even lifeless things, whether flute or harp, in giving a sound, if they give no distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp? For if indeed the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle? So also you, unless you give by the tongue an intelligible word, how will it be known what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air.&rdquo; It is concerning the matter of speaking in tongues, something which we consider to be so small, that the Apostle Paul inserted this verse with the word &ldquo;battle&rdquo; in it. No one among us would consider a battle a small thing. An army that is fighting a battle needs the morale, a fighting unity. In order to maintain this morale even a little dissension concerning the smallest matter has to be killed. If that little dissenting talk is not killed, the morale will be annulled. There will be no more morale, and surely the army will lose the fight, the battle. This warns me concerning the seriousness of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. The Lord&rsquo;s ministry is like the sounding of the trumpet for the army to go on to war (Num. 10:9; Judg. 7:18). The Lord&rsquo;s ministry is a matter of a battle (2 Tim. 2:3 and note 1&mdash;Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Fighting Army</h2>
<p>We have to realize that the Lord&rsquo;s church today is a fighting army. We are doing something more serious than any battle on this earth. We are fighting against God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. The church is God&rsquo;s army, and this is fully revealed and illustrated in many aspects in Ephesians 6. Ephesians is a book on the Body of Christ, the church. It tells us that the Body of Christ, the church, is the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:22-23). It also tells us that this church is the new man created in Christ on the cross (2:15-16). Furthermore, this church is the kingdom of God, the household of the very God (2:19), and the wife of Christ, His counterpart (5:24-25). Paul eventually tells us in Ephesians that the church, the Body of Christ, with such a tremendous status, is a warrior to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy. Whatever Christ is and whatever Christ has done should be used and applied as aspects of the armor of God. We have to wear Christ as our breastplate (6:14) and as our shield (v. 16). We have to have our loins girded with Christ (v. 14), and we have to wear Christ as a pair of shoes for our standing to fight the battle (v. 15). The church is not a mere group of people collected together. The church is a universal and divine army fighting for God in the universe against His enemy.</p>
<p>In modern history there have been two world wars, but we must realize that the church today is undertaking a universal war. The space of our war is much larger than today&rsquo;s space studied by scientists. Most of their study is confined to a single galaxy, but many, many millions of galaxies and beyond form the space in which we are fighting. We are fighting the enemy in the heavenlies, in the universal space. Our battle is great beyond measure. We are not undertaking a small battle merely for the United States or for the world. Our battle is universal. In Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning the matter of interpretation of tongues, he considered that it was related to this universal battle that we are undertaking. In his talk concerning the interpretation of tongues, he used an illustration&mdash;the sounding of a trumpet for the battle.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ministry and the Churches</h2>
<p>Whether or not a certain church takes the ministry does not decide whether that church is a genuine local church. The title of this message does not say &ldquo;no uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&rdquo; but &ldquo;in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry.&rdquo; I am not talking about something in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but I am talking about the ministry. The citizens of the United States may say many things to criticize the government and the commander in chief of the Armed Forces. But when you get into the army and become a soldier, you lose your right to say anything. It is possible to argue, debate, and even fight in the Senate, but even when the senators get in the army and become soldiers, they have to be quiet. There is no uncertain sounding in the army. The ministry is not like the Senate. The ministry is not a Congress for anyone to come here to express his opinion. The ministry has no capacity for that. The ministry is altogether filled up with a fighting spirit. I do not control any church. All the saints who have left the denominations, the divisive sects, and stand on the proper ground are a local church in their locality. They can express their opinions, but they may have nothing to do with this ministry.</p>
<p>Paul told us that all who were in Asia turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). The believers in Asia who had formerly received the apostle&rsquo;s ministry now forsook him. They did not lose their status as local churches due to the fact that they gave up Paul&rsquo;s ministry, but in fighting the battle, Paul&rsquo;s ministry could not depend upon them. For Paul&rsquo;s ministry they could not be counted on. To say that the ministry cannot depend upon a certain church does not mean that that church has been cut off from being a local church. It is still a local church, but we must realize that the ministry is a fighting unit. In this fighting unit there is no capacity and no time for your opinion.</p>
<p>I mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. I have sacrificed my entire life for the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. I gave up everything to take the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Now I must be faithful to myself. Furthermore, through my ministry on this globe, thousands of saints have come into the recovery, so I must be faithful to them. Many of the saints have given up high degrees to follow the Lord in His recovery, yet it seems what they are in is tending to be disappointing. This burdens me. Some of the saints became what they are in the Lord one hundred percent due to my ministry, and I do not want my ministry to waste their time. I have to do something to insure their investment of their whole being into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They have given up their future in the world, but they cannot have much encouragement in &rsquo;s recovery. I have to be faithful to the Lord, faithful to so many of you who have been very much affected by this ministry, and faithful to myself. For this reason, this ministry cannot allow anyone to pretend to be in it and yet still say something different. This does not mean that I ask you to stay away from your local church or that your local church is no longer a local church. What I am fellowshipping about is the impact of the ministry for the fighting of the Lord&rsquo;s interest in His recovery.</p>
<p>Whatever I would say concerning the home gatherings, the full-timers, the truth lessons, and the spreading of the gospel is not for anyone who does not feel good about my ministry, who is dissenting to my ministry, who is pretending to be here under the ministry yet actually is not. I still love all the dear saints who may fall into this category and still count them as brothers in Christ, but we need to have an army full of impact, and this army has no capacity and no time for anyone to express any kind of opinion. We are fighting a battle. The army began the fighting already in Taiwan. Now we want to see this army increasing to fight the battle not only in the United States but also in Canada, in Central America, in South America, in Europe, in Africa, in Australasia, and in the entire continent of Asia. This is what I want to see. I am not talking about the churches, I am talking about the ministry. The ministry is one thing, and the churches are another thing. These two things can be differentiated in the Epistles written by Paul. Paul&rsquo;s ministry is one category, and the churches are another category. Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Going to Fight the Battle<br />
in a Desperate Way with No Opinion</h2>
<p>Some saints came to me a number of times with reports concerning serious and even negative situations. They may have misunderstood my not responding to them with any kind of seriousness. I believe I did not respond in this way not only out of my patience and toleration but also because of the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom. I feel that it is altogether wise to be patient. When the fruit of a particular tree is growing, the fruit itself will show what it is. When the fruit becomes ripe, it will fall from the tree. At this point, however, I do not feel that I should tolerate certain situations any longer because enough damage has been done already. I do not like to see more damage done to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I have no time, dear saints, to fool around with people any longer. Let us go to fight the battle. Who are the &ldquo;us&rdquo;? The ones who are desperate with no opinion.</p>
<p>In the eighteen years that I was involved in the work on mainland China, I did a lot but no one ever heard any opinion from me. They only heard my voice in giving messages all according to Brother Nee. Some brothers can testify that among all the co-workers with Brother Nee in those eighteen years I did the most. But I labored without voicing any opinion. In the co-workers&rsquo; conferences sometimes Brother Nee would ask, &ldquo;Witness, what would you say?&rdquo; I had nothing to say. My attitude was that whatever Brother Nee told me to do, I would do it. It was that simple. From 1932 to 1950 no one ever heard me expressing any opinion regarding the work in mainland China.</p>
<p>Actually, there is nearly nothing different between my understanding and Brother Nee&rsquo;s except for one thing. I never told anyone what this was, not even my wife or family, until I came to this country and Brother Nee went to be with the Lord. The doctrinal item which I felt different from Brother Nee was regarding the two witnesses in the book of Revelation (11:3-12). This was the only difference between my understanding and Brother Nee&rsquo;s. My intention is to show you that I was not altogether the same in everything with Brother Nee. In this one thing I was not the same and I am still not the same. My point is this&mdash;in spite of this difference, I never uttered anything in my ministry that Brother Nee did not preach, and I did not teach anything that he had not touched.</p><h2 class="head2">One Flow</h2>
<p>The Lord has opened my eyes to realize as I have told you in the past, that in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is only one current flowing from the throne (Rev. 22:1). At Pentecost the current began to flow out of Jerusalem through Judea, through Samaria, and went up to Antioch. There the flow turned to Asia Minor, to eastern Europe, to Rome, and probably even to Spain, which by that time was considered as the uttermost part of the earth. There was only one flow. You cannot see two flows in the book of Acts.</p>
<p>Barnabas was an excellent brother who actually brought Saul of Tarsus into his ministry (Acts 11:25-26). At the beginning Barnabas took the lead. On the way of their first journey, however, the Spirit records that Paul began to take the lead, and the Spirit began to refer to Saul as Paul (Acts 13:9). The change of name may indicate the change in life. From this point on Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, took the lead in the apostolic ministry all the way, and Barnabas accepted that. Barnabas was one with Paul to go to Jerusalem to get the solution regarding the trouble of circumcision. Right after that solution was made as a decree to all the churches, there was a contention between Barnabas and Saul (Acts 15:35-39). This contention was not about something great but about something small. They did not separate from each other because of a different opinion concerning the faith or concerning the headship of Christ. The split between them was concerning a small, personal, intimate thing. Barnabas wanted to take his cousin Mark along with him on their journey and Paul said no. To us that is a small thing, but after Barnabas left Paul with Mark there is no more record of him in the Lord&rsquo;s move in the book of Acts. The reason for this is because the Lord would only care for one flow.</p>
<p>I saw this matter clearly in 1933 when Brother Nee asked me to join him in the work in Shanghai. At that time I was doing a work in north China that was quite prevailing and even promising to me in teaching the Bible. Because my eyes were opened, I told the Lord that I would go to Shanghai to join Brother Nee and the work. I realized that the Lord&rsquo;s flow, the Lord&rsquo;s current, on this earth has been only one. If north China were to be taken by the Lord, He would surely do it through the same flow. I had to jump into this current, to be one with this current to let the Lord flow.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Leadership in the Lord&rsquo;s Move</h2>
<p>Now let us consider Apollos. There is not a long record of Apollos in the Bible. He was not dissenting, but he somewhat remained in another flow (1 Cor. 16:12). There is no hint that Apollos intended to carry on another flow, but whatever he was and whatever he did gave people a different impression. This is why after he worked in Corinth some could say that they were of Apollos (1 Cor. 3:4), and some were puffed up on behalf of Apollos against Paul (4:6). Apollos was not wise. If he had been wise, he would have never behaved in that way.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I can declare that in those eighteen years when I was involved in the work on mainland China, I was wise. I never caused anyone to think that they could be puffed up on behalf of me against Brother Nee. There was no such thing. Whatever the saints saw of me, my behavior, my way of living, my actions, the way I worked, my messages, and my speaking, they all considered to be absolutely one with Brother Watchman Nee. I did not leave any loopholes for anyone to think that I was different from Brother Nee. I believe that was the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom through His mercy given to me. Our history since that time speaks a great deal. Among so many co-workers of Brother Nee, where is the recovery? I did not have any kind of thought to be the one to carry on the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Even when I went to Taiwan, I was definitely sent. That was Brother Nee&rsquo;s proposal to the co-workers. I never had the thinking or the feeling that I was going to be the leader. Even when I came to the United States, I did not have the thought of being the leader in the western world of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But where is the recovery today and under what kind of leadership? Some of the so-called co-workers claim that they were so close to Watchman Nee, but nearly not one church has ever been raised up by any of them.</p>
<p>It is altogether not wise for you to remain in the recovery taking this ministry on the one hand, and yet on the other hand to say something else. This is not wise. It is not profitable to yourself or to your future. You may say you have a ministry, but this is not profitable to your ministry if you have one. You can never profit your ministry in the future in this way. Rather, you have dispensed your future in a cheap way. The wise way is to stay, without any opinion, with the recovery which is unique.</p>
<p>I want to be faithful and frank, and I want to make the situation clear to all of you. I do not believe that my being here is altogether of myself. Rather, I believe that my being here is of the Lord. I want to see many of you rise up to be able to do the same thing that I am doing. I would never be jealous. I like to see this and I am for this!</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Difference Between the Army<br />
and the Citizens</h2>
<p>Now you understand my standing, my heart, and where I am. Brothers, we need to be wise. We are an army formed by His mercy and grace to fight the battle for the kingdom of the heavens! The island of Taiwan has to be evangelized and truthized by this army within the next four years. For the fulfilling of this purpose, I would not tolerate any kind of dissenting thought. To be a citizen of the United States is one thing, but to fight in the United States Army is another matter. When Gideon was called to take the army to fight the battle for Jehovah, the Lord told him that he had too many (Judg. 7:4). Eventually, the Lord chose three hundred men and told Gideon to send the others home. This does not mean that whoever went back home was no longer an Israelite. He was still an Israelite, but he had nothing to do with the fighting army.</p>
<p>You may be a member of a local church and yet have nothing to do with the ministry to fight the battle for the Lord&rsquo;s interest on this earth. All of you are the elders, the co-workers, and the apprentice elders, the leading ones, in the recovery. I am speaking to you all as the soldiers in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, not to the citizens. I am speaking to the soldiers of the army. Are you going to remain in the army? You have to realize what the army is and what the army would do. The army has no capacity to take your opinion. There is no time for the army to fool around. The situation is quite urgent. The intention of this heavenly army is to evangelize and truthize Taiwan first and then the United States.</p>
<p>One brother recently asked me if I could come to his part of the world to labor in a conference. His fellowship with me gave me the feeling that he is not fighting with us. My burden is to take Taiwan first and then the United States second. I do not care for any particular region on this earth. I am for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and I have the view to make this strategy. To my observation the best strategy is to take Taiwan first. If you are only for your part of the world this may disappoint you, but if you are for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery you&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; You may even have the burden to send some soldiers to join the army to evangelize Taiwan!</p>
<h2 class="head2">Be Wise to Acknowledge the Leader<br />
in the Lord&rsquo;s Move</h2>
<p>It is clear in the New Testament that Paul was taking the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament ministry on the earth at that time. When I was working with Brother Nee in mainland China, I never considered myself as anything. I only considered myself as a co-worker to carry out Brother Nee&rsquo;s burden. I did my best not to preach any gospel not preached by him and not to give any message never given by him. I did my best not to use any terminology or eloquence for the preaching, the speaking, the teaching, which he never used. I must declare and praise the Lord that I have received the blessing. I never regret what I did. No one ever heard one thing out of my mouth concerning Brother Nee in a negative way. I am still so grateful to him. Without him, without his ministry, I could never be here like I am. I only labored, I only worked, and I never caused any problem to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Just before the government in mainland China was about to be changed to Communism, Brother Nee proposed an urgent conference of the leading co-workers in Shanghai. He fellowshipped with us concerning how we were going to face the coming situation. He proposed to send me out of mainland China to go abroad, and he said that he and the others would sacrifice themselves in mainland China for the &rsquo;s purpose. I did not feel good about this. It seemed to me that I was a dropout and that everyone would stay but me. After the meeting, Brother Nee and I took a walk, and I asked him why it was that all the brothers would stay to sacrifice themselves for the Lord&rsquo;s work, yet I would be asked to go out. I could never forget the look on Brother Nee&rsquo;s face when he turned to look at me. He told me that we should be desperate and even willing to sacrifice ourselves for the Lord&rsquo;s move and that he realized there was much possibility that one day the enemy would wipe us out. He told me that in case we were wiped out, I had to go out so that we would still have something left. Then I said that I would take his word and go. Out of the many co-workers, I was the only one designated by him to go out in case we would be wiped out, so that we would still have something left. Whatever Brother Nee said was all fulfilled and has become history. Praise Him&mdash;we still have something left.</p>
<p>We brothers must realize that we are not doing any work of ourselves. You are not doing your work and neither am I doing my work. We are all doing a unique work for the Lord&rsquo;s unique recovery. There are over six hundred churches on this globe and not one is &ldquo;in my pocket.&rdquo; The leading ones in Anaheim can testify that I do not even know their meeting schedule. If I want to attend the &rsquo;s table I need to make a phone call to find out where I should go. Whatever churches I have built up have all gone &ldquo;into others&rsquo; pockets.&rdquo; We should realize that we are not doing a work for ourselves. We are doing a work for His recovery. Regardless of how much people have criticized Brother Nee, he was more than faithful to what he had seen. He surely worked for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and he has made a good, proper, and adequate foundation for this recovery. I am continuing to build up the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and I am doing the same work. I hope that all of you would be clear about this. Do not think about being somebody. We all are nobody! Only Christ has a Body.</p>
<p>I do feel that my frank word should make the entire situation clear to all of you and make the need clear to all of you. We need a fighting army and in the fighting army we do not merely need a leader. We need a commander to fight the battle! We do not have any time to waste. Many of you who have given up high degrees and high positions for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have to be faithful to your sacrifice. You also have to be faithful to so many who were influenced by you; otherwise, you are cheating them. We must be faithful to our Lord. We are serving Him and we mean business. We are not just doing a job to feed ourselves, to make a living. That is shameful. If you want to make a living, do not stay in the Lord&rsquo;s work. Go to another and better field for you to make a better living. We must mean business with the Lord, with the saints, and with ourselves. This is the only way for us to go on in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. Now you know where I am and where you should be. Also, you know what all of us should do&mdash;go to fight as an army and in the army. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 7: One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move,</em> pp. 75-78, 80-89, Witness Lee)</p>
<p>At least I can testify for myself and for my senior brother, Brother Watchman Nee. We always behaved, acted, and took action in the recovery as one Body. This is why the Lord&rsquo;s recovery could exist on this earth over these past approximately seventy years. We do not have any organization to keep anything, but the recovery is still here. The recovery is still existing and has been kept by the principle of the Body. While I was ministering the word, I often considered Brother Nee. I considered what he spoke; I did not like to speak anything which was contradicting with his ministry. If I had spoken in a contradicting way, where would the recovery be today? We must know the Body. (<em>The Issue of the Dispensing of the Processed Trinity and the Transmitting of the Transcending Christ,</em> p. 91, Witness Lee)</p><h2 class="head1">VI. BEING RESTRICTED TO ONE PUBLICATION WORK FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LORD&rsquo;S COMMISSION TO HIS RECOVERY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Restricted in One Publication</h2>
<p>One thing that has caused the Lord&rsquo;s recovery trouble is the fact that we have different publications. If we mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must avoid any kind of involvement in problems. When we were on mainland China, only Brother Nee had a publication, and the Gospel Room belonged solely and uniquely to him. He asked me to help in the publication work. I did write some books, among which were a book on the genealogy of Christ, a translation of part of Pember&rsquo;s <em>Earth&rsquo;s Earliest Ages,</em> and some books on the kingdom of the heavens. I never published anything by myself. I always mailed my manuscript to the Gospel Room, which was under Brother Nee and his helper. It was up to their discernment whether my manuscript should be published or not. I liked to have my writings checked as to whether there might be some inaccuracy in the truth. It is not a small matter to write a book that expounds the kingdom of the heavens. I liked my material to pass through their checking. This helped and protected me. Brother Yu, the eye specialist, translated some of the mystical books, but he did not publish anything. We only had one publication. Everything was published through Brother Nee&rsquo;s Gospel Room because the publication is really the trumpeting. The sounding of our trumpet is not just in the verbal message but more in the publication.</p>
<p>I hate to see that some of the brothers would try to publish something by copying my points mixed with their &ldquo;spices&rdquo; and their &ldquo;color.&rdquo; Why do they need to put out some points from my writings in this way? Brother Nee taught us concerning the kingdom of the heavens. I received the basic knowledge from his teaching, but he never expounded on it very much; he simply gave a sketch. It was I who from 1936 began to expound upon the sketch given to me by Brother Nee. After I published my exposition, Brother Nee admired it and told me personally that it was very good.</p>
<p>I hope that some of you brothers would do much development and expounding of all the messages I give. Do not merely speak some points, adding your own &ldquo;color&rdquo; and &ldquo;spices.&rdquo; This changes the taste. It damages my messages. You must receive the ability to expound all these things. I am not narrow. I would like to see that all of you will be great servants used by God. How wonderful that would be. But I do not like to see that some would merely repeat what I have said, pretending that it is their work with their spices and color.</p>
<p>It bothers me that some brothers among us still put out publications. According to my truthful observation there is no new light or life supply there. They may contain some biblical doctrines, but any point of life or light has been adopted from the publications of Living Stream Ministry. There is nearly no item of life or light that has not been covered by our publications. Based upon this fact, what is the need for these brothers to put out their publications? Because all the publications are mine, it is hard for me to speak such a word. But I am forced to tell the truth. By putting out your own publication, you waste your time and money. You waste the money given by the saints, and you waste their time in reading what you publish. Where is the food, the life supply, and the real enlightenment in the other publications among us? Be assured that there is definitely at least one major revelation in every Living Stream Ministry publication.</p>
<p>I was burdened to publish the Life-study Messages to stress the matter of life because this matter has been neglected, missed, and even lost to the uttermost in today&rsquo;s Christianity. In most of the commentaries and expositions there is not much of life. Even the term Life-study is a new term. I have used this term for thirty-two years. In 1954 and 1955 I finished a Life-study on the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation in Taipei.</p>
<p>This does not mean that I am so capable or so knowledgeable. It all depends upon whether or not our sovereign Lord has given you this portion. Even though I wrote some books in mainland China, I never dared to publish anything by myself. I do not like to have another sounding. Our sounding must be one, so we must be restricted in one publication. My intention in calling a writers&rsquo; conference was to encourage you to write something, but not in the way that came out. This fellowship may preserve and protect us from doing things lawlessly.</p>
<p>If some localities would have gone the proper way of the recovery, using all the materials of the ministry, their number would have increased greatly. Some are wasting their time by writing and publishing their own material. This is not their portion. I would like to see that many brothers had this portion with the riches of truth. This would be marvelous and wonderful, but this is our problem today. I advise all of you to take care of this matter. You have to swallow up the dissension. Do not let dissension eat you up.</p>
<p>I hope this fellowship will render some help to all the churches. Take these principles, pray before the Lord, and consider the real situation in your locality. Then you can make some adjustment of the eldership.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fulfilling the Lord&rsquo;s Commission<br />
to His Recovery</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s commission is His recovery, and His recovery today is to recover Christ as life, to recover the church as our living, to recover the enjoyment of Christ as everything to us, and to recover all the significances of the church life for the purpose of not only preaching the gospel but also spreading the truth. I believe that this is the unique reason that He has given us nearly all the truths in today&rsquo;s Christianity. He has given us His truths for us to spread them not only to Christians but even to the unbelievers. The entire globe is under darkness. Every human being on the earth needs to hear the truth, but our spreading of the precious truths we have received has been strongly limited. There have been many strong testimonies concerning people getting attracted and caught by the notes in the Recovery Version, but who has the burden to go out and spread these truths?</p>
<p>Some brothers who are with us do not use these truths when they teach and preach. They teach and preach what they feel is good, yet they do not realize how poor their messages are. Some brothers among us continually put out some publications. I was honest to tell them that there was no light and nothing new in what they put out. The points in our publications are full of life and light, but these brothers would not present them as they are. I could not understand why they have to change the messages we publish to present something in their own style and in their own way. There are no new points of life or light in what they publish. Any life or light in their material is altogether adopted from this ministry. I have been observing this situation among us for years. I would like to see whether some younger brothers among us would be raised up by the Lord to speak something. If I could see this, I would praise the Lord. On the other hand, I have seen some who like to build up something around themselves.</p>
<p>The Lord has commissioned us with His recovery, and He has surely opened up the New Testament to reveal many dear and precious truths to us. What the Lord needs is for thousands of His dear saints who love Him, who live to Him, and who know nothing but His recovery to take one way. Regardless of whether the saints are from Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, England, Thailand, Indonesia, or the United States, we all bear the same burden, take the same way, and spread the same truths. We dispense the truths embodied in the &ldquo;gold bar,&rdquo; the Recovery Version. We have no other merchandise! If we would be like this, the entire earth will be taken!</p>
<p>It breaks my heart to see some practicing to have another ministry, using the material of the ministry. We all have to pray, &ldquo;Lord, rescue me from my ambition to be somebody in the recovery.&rdquo; We should only know the truths of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We only use one way by one accord, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. This is what I believe the Lord is after, and this is what we all expect in the depths of our being. Everyone will feel happy about this.</p>
<p>When we go out, we do not go in a dissenting or ambitious way. If you go out with your ambition to build yourself up and I go out with my ambition to build my ministry up, we are finished. The Lord has to go to others. We all need to go out in one way like an army. Then we will have the morale and the impact.</p>
<p>We do not need to do that much. We just need to go out with a pure heart, without anything to ourselves but all things to Him. Just go out with all the truths and the Recovery Version to read to people. I assure you that you will catch someone every week. You do not need to preach your teaching or your kind of doctrine with your terminology. We have to see what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been commissioned with a big enterprise to spread the Lord&rsquo;s truths. He has given us the truths which we are holding. But we need the faithful, pure-hearted ones, who do not have any intention to live to themselves but to Him, to go out to spread these &ldquo;gold bar&rdquo; truths. There is no need for you to preach or teach in your way. Open up the Recovery Version and read some of the notes with the hungry ones.</p>
<p>Actually, though, I do not care that much for the increase. I care for the spreading of the truths so that they can get into the needy hearts. If we spread these truths, we will become the faithful servants to serve food to the Lord&rsquo;s people at the appointed time (Matt. 24:45). Then we will fulfill the commission of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is where my heart is. I will die to this. I told the brothers in the Far East I will not stop until my entire being is exhausted by this ministry. I hope you all will say the same thing.</p>
<p>If the Lord can gain ten thousand saints in the United States to go full-time with one kind of teaching, one kind of preaching, one kind of material, one kind of publication, one kind of way, and everything one kind, this will be our morale! The wise way is that we all take the full-time way and speak the same thing, think the same thing, present the same thing, and teach the same thing, having the same essence, appearance and expression. Then we will have the morale, the impact, to defeat the enemy. This is what the Lord needs! (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 8: The Life-pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s Present Move,</em> pp. 161-164, 123-127, Witness Lee)</p><h2 class="head1">VII. ENTERING INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S MINISTRY<br />
IN THE PRESENT AGE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Following the Ministry of the Age</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Seeing the Ministry of the Age</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament both Solomon and David represented the Lord. The two persons represented the one ministry in two separate ways. In the Old Testament there were many ministries. After Moses, the judges were raised up. After that, there was Solomon, the kings, and the prophets. After the Israelites were taken into captivity, the vessels for the recovery were raised up. The Old Testament is filled with different kinds of ministries. In every age there is the ministry of that age. These ministries of the ages are different from the local ministers. Luther was a minister of his age. Darby was also a minister of his age. In every age the Lord has special things that He wants to accomplish. He has His own recoveries and His own works to do. The particular recovery and work that He does in one age is the ministry of that age.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Forsaking the Past Ministries</h2>
<p>Jonathan stood between Saul and David. He was one man standing between two ministries. He should have followed the second ministry. However, because Jonathan&rsquo;s relationship with the first ministry was too deep, he could not disentangle himself. In order to catch up with the ministry of the age, there is the need for us to see the vision. Michal was married to David, yet she did not see anything. She only saw David&rsquo;s condition before God, and she could not tolerate it. As a result, she was left behind (2 Sam. 6:16, 20-23).</p>
<h2 class="head3">All Being a Matter of God&rsquo;s Mercy</h2>
<p>It is God&rsquo;s mercy that a person can see and come into contact with the ministry of that age. Yet it is altogether a different thing for a man to take up the courage to forsake the past ministry. It is a precious thing to see and it is a blessed thing to come into contact with something. Yet whether or not one can set aside his past ministry is entirely up to God&rsquo;s mercy. (<em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> vol. 57: <em>The Resumption of Watchman Nee&rsquo;s Ministry,</em> pp. 260-261, Watchman Nee)</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ministry in the Old Testament</h2>
<p>Throughout the generations there has been the work of the Lord&rsquo;s move. In the Old Testament, during Noah&rsquo;s age, the Lord&rsquo;s move was the building of the ark. This work of building the ark was the ministry in Noah&rsquo;s age. Noah was the chief minister in that ministry. However, just by Noah alone, there was no way to build the ark. At that time, there must have been some who built the ark together with Noah. The work of building the ark was the ministry in that age. Do you think that in that ministry there were two or more different works, or two or more groups of different people, or two or more different leaderships? Certainly not; otherwise, the ark could never have been built.</p>
<p>The problems of Christianity in the past two thousand years have been due to too many &ldquo;ministries.&rdquo; Every denomination and every sect say that they are building the church of Christ. Many chapels have a piece of foundation stone inscribed with the words, &ldquo;Christ Jesus, our foundation.&rdquo; One Jesus Christ is divided up into many foundations. This is the crucial point of all the problems.</p>
<p>The Bible shows us very clearly that in Noah&rsquo;s age there was only one ministry; yet many ministers were there together building the ark. This does not mean that every minister was a master builder. Only Noah was the leader in the ministry of building the ark.</p>
<p>During the age of Moses, God desired to build the tabernacle with its furniture, the most important of which was the ark. Moses himself alone could not have built all those things, but he had the ministry of building the tabernacle, which was the work to fulfill God&rsquo;s unique purpose. In this ministry, there was not only Moses himself; Moses was one of many ministers, and, undeniably, he was the leading one in that ministry. If there had been other leaders besides Moses, there would have been confusion in that situation.</p>
<p>During the age of David and Solomon, God desired to build the temple. The building of the temple was not merely a work, but a ministry. At that time, there were not two different ministries building the temple; hence, there were not two different leaderships. In David&rsquo;s age, it was David who was taking the lead. After David passed away, Solomon was the one taking the lead. However, anyone who had a part in the ministry of building the temple, including the stone-cutters and stone-movers, was a minister in that ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ministry in the New Testament</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus came and He said, &ldquo;On this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). The first one who participated in the ministry of building the church was the Lord Jesus. The Lord&rsquo;s ministry was to build up the Body of Christ. For this, He chose twelve apostles and brought them into the ministry of building the church. Afterward, He also brought in other apostles, among whom the most prominent was Paul.</p>
<p>Since in every age there has been the work of ministry, it stands to reason that in this age also there should be the continuation of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. We cannot deny that on the earth today there is the Lord&rsquo;s building. The Lord has been building throughout the generations, and He will continue to build until His building work is fully completed, when the New Jerusalem descends from heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Christian Needing to Be<br />
in the Lord&rsquo;s Ministry in This Age</h2>
<p>Now we have already seen clearly that the ministry spoken of in the Bible does not refer to a person, but to God&rsquo;s building work. Moreover, in God&rsquo;s building ministry, there are those who take the lead in that ministry in every age. May the Lord open our eyes to see that as long as we are human beings, we should be Christians; as long as we are Christians, we should enter into the Lord&rsquo;s ministry in this age.</p>
<p>Today there are thousands of people who believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved, but not many have entered into the Lord&rsquo;s ministry of building the church. It is just like the situation in Noah&rsquo;s age. There were thousands of people on the earth, but only a small number were building the ark with Noah. This is why Philippians 2:12 says, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&rdquo; What Noah and those who built the ark with him were doing was to work out their own salvation. Yes, it was God who had saved them, but the ark that delivered them was built with their own hands by God&rsquo;s grace. Today, we also need to be in God&rsquo;s building ministry to work out our own salvation, that is, to bring our salvation to its ultimate conclusion so that we can be exalted by God in glory as the Lord Jesus was.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Personal Testimony</h2>
<p>When I was saved over sixty years ago, there were Christians all around me; yet I had no knowledge of God&rsquo;s move on the earth. I thank God that He gave me a heart that loves the Bible. I read it continually and even collected many reference books. Afterward, I became very clear that as a human being, I must be a Christian, and as a Christian, I must be in God&rsquo;s move. Therefore, I dropped everything and dove into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. At that time, although I could not speak the message that I am giving this morning, the vision within me was very clear. I saw that there was the Lord&rsquo;s commission upon Brother Nee, which is the ministry. I also knew that Brother Nee was the one chosen, commissioned by the Lord in this age to bring in His recovery. I therefore recognized him as the leader in this work.

<h2 class="head2">The Leading Ones in God&rsquo;s Move&mdash;<br />
Those Who Know God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy<br />
and His Present Speaking</h2>
<p>We should believe that our God is living (1 Tim. 3:15). Since our God is living, He should be always moving. He is still moving today. Where is He moving? God&rsquo;s moving is always by speaking. Without speaking, He does not move. We must ask ourselves where God&rsquo;s speaking is. Is it in the Orthodox church, the Catholic church, the Protestant denominations, the state churches, the private churches, or the free groups? Our God who is living and moving always moves by speaking. We have to admit that His present speaking is among us. His present speaking is not concerning presbytery, baptism by immersion, tongue-speaking, gifts, healings, or evangelical movements. His speaking today is concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. I hope we can all be enlightened. I am forced to be bold to recommend myself so much to you all. I am forced to be a fool. The one who can be the leading one in the Lord&rsquo;s move today is the one who knows God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the one who knows what God&rsquo;s speaking is today.</p>
<p>Peter was surely the apostle as the leader of the Lord&rsquo;s move at the day of Pentecost because he was a person who knew God&rsquo;s speaking. He was even the mouth for God&rsquo;s speaking. Whoever is the mouth for God&rsquo;s speaking in his time is the leading one. Those to whom God is speaking are the leading apostles. Whatever they minister will be the proper leading for all the saints to follow. This definition is fair.</p>
<p>To be a person who can render the proper and adequate leadership to the believers according to the full knowledge of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is not a matter of competition. No one can compete with anyone else. It all depends upon His mercy and His compassion. Paul admitted this in Romans 9:16. God gave Paul his portion in the Body of Christ and no one could compete with him.</p>
<p>If we believe in the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty and that He is living, moving, and speaking, we have to honestly, humbly, and faithfully find out where God is speaking today. Whoever has God&rsquo;s speaking concerning the entire teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are the leading ones in His move.</p>
<p>All the churches should be identical, and those who can render the leading to all the churches are the ones who have the adequate knowledge of the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and who would pass on these teachings to the whole earth. We follow the one who is teaching and following this all-inclusive, incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ who is still ministering in the heavenlies for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We have to follow such persons and we have to take their leading. Their leading is the proper leading for all the churches. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 7: One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move,</em> pp. 69-70, 74, Witness Lee)</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. THE UP-TO-DATE WAY TO FULFILL<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S MINISTRY&mdash;<br />
MANY BROTHERS SERVING TOGETHER<br />
IN THE WAY OF BLENDING</h2>
<p>As the Lord provides me the strength and time, I intend to continue to serve and speak in the coming days. The Lord has shown me that He has prepared many brothers who will serve as fellow slaves with me in a blended way. I feel that this is the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign provision for His Body, and the up-to-date way to fulfill His ministry.
