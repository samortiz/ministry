[5]  A man was deeply touched by the Holy Spirit, and he desired to be saved.
[6]  However, he did not know the way of salvation.
[7]  He asked one of his friends, "What should I do to be saved?"
[8]  His friend was busy with his own work and answered him hastily, "Start with the first all' in Isaiah 53:6 and end with the last all,' and you will be saved."
[9]  A person who loved to joke once asked his Christian chauffeur, "What is the fastest way to hell?"
[10]  The chauffeur said, "If you open the door and jump out, hell will be right there.
[11]  But you should remember that if you do not believe in God, you will not be there, because there is no one in hell who does not believe in God!"
[12]  A certain king only saw his son once a year at the appointed time when the son came for his supply and money.
[13]  In order that the father could see the son every day and be near to him and have fellowship with him, the father changed the meeting time to once a day.
[14]  What we have quoted was the first section of his sermon.
[15]  Now he proceeded on to the second section, "The New Concepts."
[16]  He said, "We are like the ancient Greeks, always seeking for the new things, and we are still in the process of seeking."
[17]  The preacher read the Bible: "For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep; because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[18]  One day by a river, a man was angrily tearing apart a tract that another person had given to him, and he was throwing it into the river.
[19]  The amazing thing was that the wind blew a piece of the shredded paper back into his sleeve.
[20]  The following is a drunkard's will which was found on a chair in his room after he had committed suicide.
[21]  It concerns a very sober and tragic matter: "What I am leaving to the world is a detestable character and corrupted example.
[22]  What I am leaving to my parents is unbearable sorrow in their failing age.
[23]  THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES 1 Issue No. 3, January 1926
[24]  Edited from Newspapers in the West ALMOST SIX THOUSAND YEARS
[25]  Strictly speaking, there is, of course, no proof that the millennium will begin at the end of six thousand years of human history.
[26]  However, there are many proofs that the millennium is the Sabbath day of all the millenniums and the reality of the jubilee.
[27]  The students of prophecy know that before Christ will appear on earth, Antichrist will appear.
[28]  He will be one of the Roman Emperors revived.
[29]  This is clearly the false work of the evil spirits, because 1 the dead believers are now in paradise and cannot come out of it, 2 the Lord never asks dead people to preach to the living, 3 the Lord forbids the dead to communicate with the living and would, therefore, never send a dead person back to life, and 4 this voice did not acknowledge that the Lord Jesus had come in the flesh.
[30]  Around September 1925, the government in Rome was changed from self-rule to national-rule.
[31]  The correspondent in Rome of the British Morning Post August 25, 1925 said, "This is a necessary step for the renewed expansion of Caesar's city."
[32]  Editor's note: This column considers world events from the scriptural view.
[33]  It is for the purpose of showing the imminent return of the Lord, and not for ascertaining the date of His return.
[34]  Yet the conference did not affirm what we believe in. Cardinal doctrines such as the inspiration of the Bible, the virgin birth, the vicarious death for redemption, the gospel of the shedding of the blood, and the physical resurrection were, according to my knowledge, not mentioned at all.
[35]  1 A new shipping company: A Jewish Forum Paper said that recently a new organization called the Palestinian Shipping Company has been formed.
[36]  It has six commercial liners that will travel between New York, Haifa, and the Mediterranean Sea.
[37]  2 The return of the Jews: A certain Jewish organization claimed recently, "During the past six years, we have helped eighty thousand Jews to return to Palestine...They have been redeemed and are now in the work of redeeming many thousands and hundreds of thousands of other people.
[38]  Because there were over eighty thousand who have migrated to Palestine during the past six years, one thousand Jews were able to leave Poland at one time and join the increasing crowd...Although eighty thousand is only one percent of the total Jewish population in Europe..yet this is only a beginning.
[39]  We have long conjectured that "the king of the north" Dan 11:28-end would perhaps come from Russia.
[40]  But we did not know how the Roman emperor would come to terms with the king of the north.
[41]  The Rome correspondent, Mr. ______ of the English Daily News, wrote on September 30, 1925: "Although I need no further proof than what I have already, which proofs for certain reasons I cannot fully reveal yet, since my last report I have received solid evidence of Mussolini communicating with Russia in private.
[42]  We thank the Lord that He has sent His Son to die on the cross for our sins and has given us the Holy Spirit, so that we do not have to be condemned, but will have the newness of life and can go to heaven eventually.
[43]  We should not be proud of ourselves; we should acknowledge our failures before God and should ask God to revive His own church and prepare the little flock who love Him faithfully to be ready for His coming.
[44]  Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures THE CHINESE SOCIETY FOR
[45]  Because of the danger of the work of this Society, the reporter issued a warning in the fifth issue of this paper.
[46]  Thank the Lord that many have awakened to the work of this Society.
[47]  They do not preach the redemptive gospel of the Lord Jesus.
[48]  I do not understand why Bible-believing orthodox churches would support such works that oppose God and would yield to their soft-spoken control.
[49]  According to a recent report of the Zionists, there are now about one hundred fifty thousand people living in Palestine.
[50]  Among them twenty-five thousand are farmers, and twenty thousand are laborers.
[51]  They have introduced commerce and industry, which has been something unknown to this region for more than a few hundred years.
[52]  The German Leipzig Professor Franz Delitzsch is a zealous Christian.
[53]  December is before us, and those in the denominations are celebrating Christmas again.
[54]  In the opinion of many believers, to celebrate Christmas and to set aside a day during the year to remember the birth of the Savior is a very good thing.
[55]  Our question and what we are concerned with is not what men say, but what God has said.
[56]  As long as something is not forbidden, even though there is no commandment from God, and even though the matter is absolutely contrary to the spirit of the cross of the Lord Jesus, the fact that there is no explicit prohibition means that one can therefore act according to the flesh!
[57]  In July this year, there were one thousand sixty Jews who returned to Palestine.
[58]  We have seen that many Jews are returning to their homeland.
[59]  Now, not only are the living returning; the dead ones are also returning!
[60]  In the last one hundred years, the United States has been able to assimilate all kinds of peoples into one culture.
[61]  Archaeologist Professor Sellin was satisfied that he had unearthed the altar of Abraham and the tomb of Joseph in Shechem.
[62]  The Bible predicts that before the Lord Jesus comes to earth, the old Roman Empire will be revived.
[63]  We know that the old Roman Empire was quite large and that its empire has now disintegrated into many powerful nations.
[64]  The Bible tells us that these nations will eventually become a federation of ten nations.
[65]  Seventeen years ago, Tel Aviv near Joppa was just a plot of sand.
[66]  All those who pay attention to the movement of the Jews realize that a new age has dawned for the Jews.
[67]  According to the words of one Jerusalem member of the patriotic Jewish society, development of hydroelectric power on the river Jordan is one of the most notable works of the Jews who have returned to Palestine.
[68]  Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures THE WOMAN AND THE BEAST
[69]  If we put Mussolini together with the Pope, we can easily identify them as a type of the woman in scarlet riding on the red beast in Revelation 17.
[70]  Cardinal Merry del Val of the Vatican not long ago, in an apparently carefully prepared public speech, spoke of Mussolini on behalf of the authority of the Pope, that "he is obviously a man worthy of the protection of God.
[71]  This is what we are being told concerning the reason we went into the four terrible years of war.
[72]  Of course, we can spend a lot of time to reconsider the benefit of the war, and it is true that there has never been a time when there has been as much propaganda about peace.
[73]  THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES 9 Issue No. 22, October 1927
[74]  These two countries always occupy an important role on the eastern stage, and they will continue to play a leading role.
[75]  Turkey will join itself with the king from the north, and Egypt will be the chief part of the king from the south.
[76]  Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures THE FASCIST CALENDAR
[77]  There is one chain of Christian belief that binds the whole of Europe together; it is the calendar of our Savior.
[78]  Not only has Europe remembered the birth of Christ by its calendar, but it has called it the Year of Our Lord.
[79]  All questions regarding the Bible and spiritual matters can be directed to the editor.
[80]  Although they consider this prophecy to be for the end time the end time in the Bible always refers to "the day of the Lord" before the Lord appears on the earth, that is, the last of the seventy weeks mentioned in Daniel 9 , they say on page 110 of their Exposition on Daniel that the Lord Jesus entered the heavenly Holy of Holies in A.D. 1844 and started the work of judgment.
[81]  Question: Revelation 22:2 says, "The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations."
[82]  Yet 21:4 says, "And death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away."
[83]  Question: Are the two men in Revelation 11 two of the three from among Elijah, Enoch, and Moses?
[84]  If so, will they be changed the same way as that which is described in 1 Corinthians 15?
[85]  The Bible testifies everywhere that the Father is God 2 Tim 1:2, etc. . The Bible also attests that the Son is God.
[86]  Question: What does the church in Matthew 18:17 refer to?
[87]  The Gospel of Matthew mentions the church twice, both of which are words spoken by our blessed Lord.
[88]  There are two biblical meanings for the word church: 1 The church that is composed of all those redeemed by the precious blood of the Lord.
[89]  Question: According to James 1:17, the heavenly Father never gives any gift of imperfection.
[90]  But in reality, He has granted many believing brothers some imperfections, which benefit the weaker believers.
[91]  Although God has given many servants to His church Eph 4:11 , I do not consider it a great gift of God to the church that some brothers become a "benefit" to other believers.
[92]  They may become a means for God to bestow gifts to others, but they themselves are not the gifts of God.
[93]  Question: What does Psalm 51:4 mean when it says, "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned"?
[94]  Although he had sinned against Uriah, and although he had sinned against Bathsheba, his deep regret before God caused him to consider the way he had grieved God and fallen short of His glory.
[95]  If you have any questions regarding the Bible or the spiritual life, please send them to the editor.
[96]  Questions which are not edifying will not be answered.
[97]  Question: John 10 speaks of the sheepfold and the doorkeeper.
[98]  All who have biblical and spiritual questions may write to the editor.
[99]  We, of course, will try our best to answer.
[100]  Question: How should we interpret the parable in Matthew 25:27?
[101]  Answer: The talents in this parable are the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
[102]  "Deposited my money with the money changers" v. 27 means to pass on to one or two people the gift you have received from the Holy Spirit and to let them work, so that you can receive some interest indirectly.
[103]  Question: If a person is not at all saved by works, and if faith is the only condition, why then were the people in Matthew 7:22-23 cast out?
[104]  They preached and healed and must have known the Lord Jesus also.
[105]  The Lord's brothers 1 did not believe in Him v. 5 , 2 were wrong in their advice v. 4 , and 3 did not really want the Lord to go into the capital to keep the feast, but were asking Him to make a show of Himself in the capital v. 3 . Therefore, the Lord did not listen to them.
[106]  Question: We advocate that there should not be denominations.
[107]  But without large meetings, there will not be a general acquaintance with each other among the saints.
[108]  Question: The Ten Commandments in Exodus 34 are different from the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5.
[109]  Exodus 34:28 says clearly that Jehovah wrote these commandments with His finger.
[110]  The words of the covenant are the Ten Commandments v. 28 . From this we know that the words in verses 10-26 are not part of the words of the Ten Commandments; they are merely words according to which God made the covenant Ten Commandments with the people of Israel.
[111]  Question: Concerning the leaven which is mentioned in Matthew 13, one group says it represents sin; another group says it represents power.
[112]  The three measures of meal being wholly leavened does not represent the power of the gospel changing the whole world, because in this very chapter the Lord Jesus said that the world will never change.
[113]  Whoever has questions concerning the Bible and the spiritual things can write to the editors; we will try our best to answer them.
[114]  Please understand that unprofitable questions will not be answered.
[115]  Question: In Matthew 25:31-32 the Lord comes down to judge all the nations referring to the Gentiles to separate the sheep from the goats referring to the saved ones and the unsaved ones .
[116]  Question: Those who have received the Holy Spirit now speak in tongues.
[117]  Are these tongues the same as the tongues spoken of in the Bible?
[118]  Answer: Some of the tongues mentioned in the Bible are not understood by others 1 Cor 14:7-9 , but they are still human languages v. 21 . Lately, the tongues spoken by those who claim they can speak in tongues are not dialects of any people in any country or in any place; they are merely a kind of yelling and shouting.
[119]  Question: What does the phrase under the earth in Philippians 2:10 mean?
[120]  Is it the same as your explanation for 1 Peter 3:19 in the first issue of this magazine?
[121]  So Philippians 2:10 means that the Lord Jesus is the Lord over everything in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, for there is a spirit world under the earth.
[122]  Question: The Bible only asks people not to become drunken, but it does not ask people to abstain from drinking.
[123]  Furthermore, Jesus changed water into wine, and He Himself also drank wine Matt 11:19 .
[124]  Question: In Luke 22:36 and 38 the Lord Jesus asked the disciples to sell their garments and buy swords.
[125]  The disciples answered that there were two swords there.
[126]  Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus opposed him, saying, "Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword" Matt 26:52 . c If the Lord Jesus had wanted them to use force, then this would have been entirely contrary to the teaching that says "not to resist him who is evil" 5:38-44 .
[127]  If anyone desires to ask biblical or spiritual questions, he may send letters to the editor.
[128]  Question: Do believers who have slept in the Lord ascend to heaven directly, or do they wait in Hades for the Lord's coming?
[129]  Paul said, "For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church" v. 35 . Moreover, immediately after this, Paul said, "If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him fully know the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord" v. 37 . Today, man considers that spiritual women can preach in the meetings, but Paul considered that if women were spiritual, then they would not preach in the meetings! The world considers that spiritual women can be an exception, but the Bible uses this to test who is spiritual: those who are spiritual will not open their mouth! It is true that the Lord Jesus chose many women to preach for Him, but the Lord did not command them to preach in the meetings.
[130]  Question: Revelation 7 recorded that a hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed.
[131]  But the tribe of Dan was not included in this number.
[132]  Question: When the devil sinned, he was driven to the earth away from God's presence and became the enemy of man and God.
[133]  Why is it that the devil was able to go before God again to accuse Job?
[134]  Why would God even grant the devil's request to test Job?
[135]  If Job's faith was not strong at that time and he had failed, who would be responsible for this?
[136]  Answer: God has His timing, and before the time He has set for the devil is up, the devil can still come before God.
[137]  Question: In Luke 16:1-9, it seems that the Lord's intention in speaking the parable is to disapprove of this kind of person.
[138]  But in verse 8 He commended the same for doing wisely, as if He somewhat approved of him.
[139]  Verse 9 says, "And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles."
[140]  Question: What is the explanation of Matthew 12:31-32?
[141]  Answer: To sin by blaspheming the Holy Spirit was for men to harden their hearts when they knew v. 27 that the Lord Jesus Himself had cast out demons by the Holy Spirit v. 28 , and for them to say that He cast out the demons by the ruler of the demons v. 24 . This sin occurred only in those days.
[142]  The Lord Jesus came to the world to save men; all sins against Him and all other sins can be forgiven.
[143]  Question: Since you went back, I have been reading two chapters of the Bible a day.
[144]  Matthew 27:52 says, "And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised."
[145]  But there is a record in another place of the Bible which says that Christ is the firstborn from the dead.
[146]  But can I say that the word "apostle" can be used as a title also, because the apostles are "ordained"?
[147]  Question: What is the significance of the angel contending for the body of Moses in Jude 9?
[148]  Question: Does the woman in Revelation 12:1 refer to the Jewish nation?
[149]  Should the man-child in 12:5 then refer to the Jews who turn back to the Lord during the tribulation?
[150]  Please forgive us for not answering any unprofitable questions.
[151]  Question: I have read the question and answer on women preaching, published in March, the fifth issue of your magazine, concerning whether it is proper for women to preach in the meetings.
[152]  I have heard of many brothers and sisters who love the Lord and who have considered this question important and have thought negatively about what you have published in the paper.
[153]  Question: I read the question and answer column of the eleventh issue of your paper and saw the question from Mr. Chien from Changchou concerning the resurrection of the saints of old.
[154]  Will you explain to me whether there is a contradiction between the word in Matthew 27:52 and that in 1 Corinthians 15:20?
[155]  In your reply, you said that the Lord Jesus was not the first one to resurrect, and that Elisha and the Lord both had called someone back to life.
[156]  Although you explained at the end that "the Lord is the only one who resurrected in such a way," this kind of answer is bound to create misunderstanding.
[157]  In my opinion, the people raised up by Elijah, by Elisha, and by the Lord Jesus were not a resurrection of the spiritual body such as will be in the future; they were merely a return of the soul to the body after the person had died.
[158]  The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is indeed the first one, in that He was the first one who had resurrected with a spiritual body 1 Cor 15:20 .
[159]  This can be proved from verse 53 which says that these ones came out only after the Lord's rising from the tomb, which means that no one was able to resurrect before the Lord Jesus did.
[160]  Question: Someone asked, "Is it God's commandment that we observe Sunday?"
[161]  Question: I have read the tenth issue of The Christian, which said that believers who are saved are eternally saved.
[162]  It divided believers into three classes: Those who are being rewarded, those who will not be rewarded, and those who will be punished.
[163]  I really admire your explanations, which are all according to the Bible.
[164]  As for Ananias and Sapphira, if they were among "the multitude of those who had believed" Acts 4:32 , even though they were delivered to Satan for the destruction of their flesh, yet this was for the purpose that their spirit would be saved in the day of the Lord 1 Cor 5:5 .
[165]  Question: I was baptized as an infant, but infant baptism is never mentioned anywhere in God's Word the Bible .
[166]  As I was growing up, my parents told me that I had already received baptism and had no need to be baptized again, and that the position I held was already that of a disciple of the Lord.
[167]  If I pass another examination, I could be received into the communion.
[168]  I believe that this is something man has added to the Bible, and I believe that this does not agree with the Bible.
[169]  However, if one dies during childhood, he is saved already and no longer has any need for such an act, because at that age a child does not know what it is to believe and does not even know the difference between the left hand and the right.
[170]  Question: Sometimes in my spirit, because of God's mercy, I can see His hand working in every way.
[171]  During these times, even though I have hardships and opposition, my heart is full of praise, thanksgiving, and joy.
[172]  It is as if I desire no one besides the Lord.
[173]  Even though I still love the Lord and desire the Lord, my heart feels lost, as if I am in a thick fog.
[174]  I hope that you will teach your foolish brother in the Lord how to keep the sight that I have received.
[175]  Just as we would read the Bible, pray, preach, and serve the Lord when we are joyful, in the same way we should read the Bible, pray, preach, and serve Him when we do not feel anything and our heart is as cold as ice.
[176]  Question: Recently, some churches have proposed that one should not keep the Sabbath on the day of resurrection.
[177]  It is not God's will in the Bible that we observe the day of resurrection.
[178]  In taking the holy communion, we should use unleavened bread and grape juice and should not have anything else as a substitute.
[179]  Question: I read 2 Kings 6:8-19 which says that the Syrians surrounded Dothan not for the sake of the Israelites, but to look for Elisha.
[180]  When the Syrians reached Dothan, why did Elisha say, "This is not the way, neither is this the city"?
[181]  Question: I have believed in the Lord for many years, but have not received much enlightening.
[182]  Recently, I read a newspaper that said that under the tide of revolution those who are involved with missionary works in the church should join the anti-Christian movement.
[183]  Some have even said that any fundamental biblical teaching that is not in conformity to the current of the age should be criticized.
[184]  I feel that this is too much devaluating of the worth of the Bible.
[185]  Question: Is the Christian and Missionary Alliance the same in nature as all the other denominations?
[186]  Answer: In order to answer this question, one must first know what is a sect.
[187]  There are a few elements to a sect: 1 a name, 2 a charter other than the Bible whether scriptural or not , and 3 not including all regenerated believers.
[188]  Question: How do you explain Matthew 18:18 and John 20:23?
[189]  Some have said that these words were added in the Middle Ages and were not proposed by the Lord Jesus Himself.
[190]  Question: Matthew 27:32, Mark 15:21, and Luke 23:26 all say that Simon the Cyrenian took up the Lord's cross.
[191]  Why does it say in John 19:17 that the Lord Jesus bore His own cross to a place?
[192]  Did He ask this Simon to bear it for Him along the way?
[193]  According to Luke, Simon the Cyrenian was bearing the cross together with the Lord Jesus; the Lord was walking in front of him, and he was walking behind the Lord.
[194]  Question: How can a congregation identify those who have been gifted to oversee it?
[195]  According to Acts 13:1-3, is the laying on of hands, and an open declaration of such, something condemned by the Lord?
[196]  What is the limit of authority of those who oversee the church?
[197]  If they do not have any authority at all, how can they settle disputes in the church?
[198]  It is true that the authority of the church rests with the whole congregation, but does this mean that everyone should exercise his own authority and should not be bound by anything?
[199]  The meetings of the believers are at times for prayer, at times for preaching, at times for the discussion of affairs, and at times for the breaking of bread to remember the Lord.
[200]  For now we will only talk about the meetings for the breaking of bread and the worship of the Lord.
[201]  This means that we should have the Lord as the center, and we should come for Him and worship Him.
[202]  In the meetings, we should pay special attention that we are coming to the Lord Himself.
[203]  QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX 10 Issue No. 24 WHO THE ROBBERS ARE
[204]  Question: In John 10 the Lord says, "All who came before Me are thieves and robbers."
[205]  Answer: The Lord Jesus is not referring to the prophets of old.
[206]  Hence, if a man says, "If the Lord Jesus had to fulfill the law, does not a Christian have to do the same?" he is saying that since the Lord Jesus had to redeem man from sin, the believers should also redeem man from sin!
[207]  Answer: The Bible only recognizes one organization as legitimate for Christians to join and which Christians ought to join; it is the church.
[208]  Other than the church, the Bible does not consider that believers should join any other organizations.
[209]  Social organizations are not found in the Bible, and even "evangelistic societies," "prayer societies," and "missions" are not found in the Bible.
[210]  The heavier a load that a boat carries, the lower it will sink, and the bigger the fruit that grows on a tree, the lower the branches will bend.
[211]  The bigger a tree becomes, the deeper the roots will go.
[212]  This is also true with those who have received more grace from God.
[213]  Those who have not received very much grace are boastful; however, a humble person has always received more grace from God.
[214]  TWELVE BASKETS FULL 2 Issue No. 3 FRAGMENTS OF GEMS
[215]  If you love the Lord Jesus, you should tell Him.
[216]  God says He will bless us when we obey Him.
[217]  To have fellowship with the Lord Jesus is far more important than to work for Him.
[218]  If God leads you to walk a way that you know, it will not benefit you as much as if He would lead you to take the way that you do not know.
[219]  Those who love the Lord do not wish to be great in this world.
[220]  Under no circumstances should the saints of God criticize others.
[221]  I surely would like to leave this place to meet with some saints to soothe my loneliness.
[222]  O Lord, I dare not move one step; for I know that Your Spirit works in my heart to divide my soul from my spirit, so that my spirit can ascend to heaven and so that I can be one spirit with the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, and not be affected by the provocation of my soul.
[223]  To exalt oneself is to put one's self in an improper place.
[224]  This is a danger to the young believers and a trap to the older saints.
[225]  "Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.
[226]  For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place...and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
[227]  All the burdens that the Lord gives to us are light and easy.
[228]  He has not asked us to bear what we cannot bear.
[229]  Every believer should do his individual preaching, but it is not mandatory that every believer be a full-time preacher.
[230]  Those who work for the Lord, of course, labor daily in the Lord's work.
[231]  However, an ordinary believer has to go to work to make his living and to provide for his family.
[232]  The person who genuinely works for the Lord realizes that what he does is God's work and that eventually he will gain his reward.
[233]  If we want to meet God and to have His presence in all our works, we should remember the word, "Whatever you do,...as to the Lord and not to men" Col 3:23 .
[234]  If those rich children of God have a heart to love the Lord, they do not have to deny themselves in their daily life that much, and the temple of the Lord will still be filled up.
[235]  TWELVE BASKETS FULL 5 Issue No. 9 MEDITATION ON CHRIST
[236]  The four Gospels display the perfect life of the Lord Jesus.
[237]  The Gospel of Matthew depicts Him as the King; the Gospel of Mark, as the Servant; the Gospel of Luke, as Man; and the Gospel of John, as God.
[238]  One of our frequent failures in reading the Gospels is to pay brief attention to the words and deeds of Christ only.
[239]  Seldom do we see Christ Himself, and seldom do we behold the Christ that we ought to behold.
[240]  Prayer is an expression of our desire before God.
[241]  The Bible records that many people had their prayers answered.
[242]  If what we pray for truly comes from the bottom of our heart, surely the answers to our prayers will not be so few.
[243]  However, our feeling toward God's grace changes with time.
[244]  NOTES FROM MY BIBLE 1 Issue No. 5 ACTS 14
[245]  Verse 4:"But the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles."
[246]  Verse 5:"And when a hostile attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to treat the apostles outrageously and to stone them..."
[247]  Verse 15: "And after that the Levites shall go in to do the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall cleanse them and shall offer them as a wave offering."
[248]  "After that" here means after being fully consecrated to the Lord vv.
[249]  God does not want us to work for Him before we are fully His.
[250]  Notice the order here: 1 the atonement this is our salvation; 2 offer up as a wave offering this is our consecration; 3 "to Me" this is the Lord's acceptance; 4 caring for the things of the tabernacle this is our work of service to the Lord; 5 offer up as a wave offering this is the second time that they are offered.
[251]  Verses 1-2:"But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
[252]  And many will follow their licentiousness, because of whom the way of the truth will be reviled."
[253]  But Paul was greatly disturbed; and turning, he said to the spirit, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.
[254]  At the present time, God will not have the spirits preach for him.
[255]  Verse 4:"You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world."
[256]  We do not have to search elsewhere, for He is already in us.
[257]  We overcome because the One who is in us is greater than the evil spirits.
[258]  We do not have to be afraid of the world, because what is in the world is only the evil spirits.
[259]  Verse 6:"We are of God; he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us.
[260]  Verse 7:"Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God."
[261]  In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.
[262]  Verse 5:"And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ."
[263]  Compare this verse with 17:16: "And while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols."
[264]  Wherever a believer is, among other believers or by himself, he should have the same earnestness for the salvation of others.
[265]  Verse 7:"And he left there and went into the house of one named Titius Justus, one who worshipped God, whose house was next to the synagogue."
[266]  Verse 28:"A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly."
[267]  Such an act is forbidden even if it is done in the name of the Lord.
[268]  Verses 2-3:"Thus says Jehovah, Stand in the court of the house of Jehovah and speak to all the cities of Judah, who come to worship in the house of Jehovah, all the words which I command you to speak to them, and do not take away a word.
[269]  Verses 21, 28:"From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised."
[270]  "Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."
[271]  Verse 27:"For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings."
[272]  Verse 5:"And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the crucified."
[273]  He was not talking to the "shaking" Roman soldiers v. 4 . The Lord cares for His children!
[274]  Lord, even if You try me in the most severe way and do not fulfill my wishes, but cause me to suffer in my heart and soul, may You grant me enough strength to say, "Lord, You are right!"
[275]  Verses 18, 20:"And Zachariah said to the angel, By what shall I know this?
[276]  For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years."
[277]  "And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."
[278]  Verse 2:"Avenge the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people."
[279]  Verse 3:"And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah's vengeance on Midian."
[280]  When we fight with Satan, we are avenging the Lord.
[281]  Although God can avenge His own foes, He wants His people to work with Him.
[282]  Verse 4:"But when Jesus heard it, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it."
[283]  With such a word from the Lord, even when a person dies, he will still be delivered from death.
[284]  Hence, when the Lord leads us through a death that is not really death such as the one experienced by Lazarus , we should believe in the Lord's word which says, "not unto death."
[285]  FILLERS Issue No. 1 "NEITHER WILL I CONDEMN THEE"
[286]  The Lord Jesus is the unique Man, the perfect Man, and the most holy Man.
[287]  Our Faith:We believe that the Bible is God's Word, word-for-word.
[288]  We believe in a literal interpretation of all the major truths of the Bible.
[289]  We are not afraid to preach the pure Word of the Bible, even if men oppose; but if it is not the Word of the Bible, we could never agree even if everyone approved of it.
[290]  I am very sorry that due to the hurried publication of the second issue, many of the pages toward the end were not adequately proofread by me, so there were many errors.
[291]  I would ask the readers to forgive us for this!
[292]  Purpose:To cultivate the Christian's spirituality; to proclaim the salvation of the cross; to warn of the danger of modernism.
[293]  The month before last, I was invited to work here in southern Fukien.
[294]  But due to the fact that the next issue of the magazine was not yet ready and due to my physical weakness, I was not able to come.
[295]  The week before last, in my prayer, the Lord showed me clearly that I should come.
[296]  In the summer I went to Anhwei to conduct meetings.
[297]  On my way back I passed by Shanghai and got a heat stroke, which put me in bed for a few days.
[298]  In my sickness I received the necessary lessons from God.
[299]  Hence, we need to say a few words to the brothers and sisters in the big family of The Christian.
[300]  While, on the one hand, there are not many spiritual publications today, on the other hand, there are enough to make us wonder whether there was sufficient need for us to publish The Christian.
[301]  This is to inform you that in order not to delay the publication of this issue of The Christian, we have combined the January and February issues, that is, Issue Nos.
[302]  I remember after having been a believer for only one year, a friend gave me several spiritual books, one of which was Straight Paths.
[303]  At that time when I read it, I found it incomprehensible in many places.
[304]  I remember two points that helped me the most; one was concerning regeneration, and the other concerning the question of sectarianism.
[305]  Although prior to this I was already regenerated in experience, yet there was still much darkness in my mind regarding what exactly is the whole matter of regeneration.
[306]  Worship is an art that is long lost among Christians.
[307]  There are very few people who know the meaning of the word worship.
[308]  There are fewer who know how to worship God in spirit and reality.
[309]  In the fourth issue, we have added this column, and many have echoed their approval.
[310]  Booksellers often use advertisements to attract people to buy their books.
[311]  Its purpose is: "specifically given to the preaching of the genuine voice of God, the gospel of salvation, the soon coming of the Lord Jesus, the expounding of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, the Savior of all mankind, and the Christ."
[312]  Its clarity in exposition and depth of knowledge has been welcomed by most Bible-believing men.
