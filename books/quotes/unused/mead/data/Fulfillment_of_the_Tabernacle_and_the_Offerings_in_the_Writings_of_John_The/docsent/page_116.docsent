   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWELVE 2 Scripture Reading: John 12:1-50</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we saw that the first sign in John twelve is the sign of the house in Bethany, a house which is a miniature of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall go on to consider the other signs in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTED LAZARUS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The next sign in John 12 is the sign of the resurrected Lazarus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1-2, 9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This sign is a testimony of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 9 says that the people came "that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from among the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lazarus was a living testimony of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, Lazarus did not do anything; he simply was a testimony of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Martha was serving, and Mary was expressing her love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lazarus, however, was simply reclining at the table with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The testimony of Lazarus became the center of people's attention.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a testimony of resurrection life, Lazarus attracted others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The principle is the same today in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The most attracting factor in the church life is our testimony of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, someone may testify to his relatives, "You know what kind of person I was.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You could even say that I was dead and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But now I am a resurrected person."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today the Lord does not mainly want us to do things for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He wants us to be His testimony, a testimony of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To some extent, people are moved by Mary's love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may look at this dear sister and appreciate her love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the church life is not centered on this love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The center of the church life is a living testimony of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This testimony, of course, is not of the natural life, but of a resurrected life, a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I wish to emphasize the fact that the center of the church life must be persons living no longer by the natural life, but living by resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not necessary for a resurrected person to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He may simply recline at the table, and others will be satisfied to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not think that any kind of religious service can attract others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither should we think that our love for the Lord will be the primary attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If our love is not a love that comes out of resurrection life, it will never be a means of attracting people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The central attraction, which is also the focus of the church life, is resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we all live this resurrection life, we shall become those who attract others to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Other people appreciate resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a young person tries to tell his parents how much he loves the Lord, this may offend them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Parents want to see that their child is living a certain kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your parents may not care about religious service or even appreciate your love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But they will appreciate the fact that you are living another life, a resurrection life, a life that has brought you out of the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, resurrection life should be our focus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes certain people have advised me to give messages on a particular subject.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the most part I respond to these suggestions by saying, "There is no need for me to give messages on these subjects, for many others are speaking on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, many Christians do not pay any attention at all to resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, I am burdened to minister life to the Lord's people."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because it is our burden to minister life, our Bible studies are called Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many years ago we coined the term "life-study," realizing that what the children of God need today is a life-study of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because God's people need life, year after year we publish the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not our intention to pass on mere Bible knowledge that will cause others to exercise their mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our goal is to minister resurrection life from the written Word to God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need resurrection life.</S>
