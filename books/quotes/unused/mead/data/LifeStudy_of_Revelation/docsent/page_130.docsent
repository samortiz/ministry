   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED FOR TRANSFORMATION AND BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the apostle John ate the little scroll, it was sweet in his mouth but bitter in his stomach 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our experience is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we saw the vision, we were happy because the vision was so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But after seeing this vision, throughout the years we have had a bitter feeling in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This bitter feeling concerns the poor situation among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even among us who are so close to the Lord s ministry there are many who do not care for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They care for their blessings and their personal spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Others care for being fundamental and doctrinally correct, but they do not care for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They need to be revolutionized and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May I say a frank, honest, and loving word to these dear ones?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Forget about doctrine and look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who and what are you?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It matters little whether the doctrine is correct or not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What truly matters is what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For years you have been concerned with doctrine, but has there been any change in you?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Are you still the same as you were twenty-five years ago?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps you have never experienced any transformation and building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may consider yourself to be spiritual, scriptural, fundamental, and right.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in what part of your being have you been transformed, and with whom have you been built up?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Day by day, you embrace the Bible, endeavoring to be fundamentally correct in doctrine, but what about your being?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Has there been a change in you?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEING TRANSFORMED THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GOD S DISPENSING HIMSELF INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is God s building?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s building is to dispense Himself into us and to work Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consider again the illustration of petrified wood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The wood is natural, having no mineral element whatsoever to give it the substance of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no wood in God s eternal building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His building there are only precious stones, gold, and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem are layers of precious stones 21:19-20 , and the entire wall is built with jasper 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Jerusalem there is nothing of mud or wood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By nature we all are either muddy or wooden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone would rather be wooden than muddy, thinking that wood is superior to mud.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nevertheless, neither mud nor wood is useful in God s building hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The muddy people need to be transformed into precious stones, and the wooden ones need to be petrified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The way for a piece of wood to be petrified is to allow the living water to flow through it to carry away the wooden substance and to replace it with a solid mineral element.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The process of petrification in the physical world is a symbol of the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today God is truly petrifying us by the flow of His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This flow is clearly revealed in Revelation 22:1, which says, And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This river flows throughout the whole city.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I constantly have a bitter taste within me, a bitter feeling concerning today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They appear to know much, but actually they are more than ignorant and know nearly nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It does not matter what you know.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may know many things, but every part of you may still be mud or wood, indicating that you have not been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be transformed by God s dispensing Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Forget your knowledge of the Bible and forget your religion, and just take care of one thing how much you have been transformed by the living God s dispensing Himself into you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what truly matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may be able to recite so many verses in the Bible, yet you yourself mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nothing counts in God s economy but Himself dispensed into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope that many of you will be able to say, I don t know very much about the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I only know one thing: day by day God is dispensing Himself into me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every day, something of God flows in to carry away my natural element and to replace it with His divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am deeply burdened!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not matter whether you are good or bad, holy or unholy, spiritual or unspiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The only thing that matters is whether or not you have been touched by the Lord and have been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be willing to open ourselves and say, Lord, get through.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, flow in, through, and out of me and carry away every particle of my natural element.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lord, I hate the outward improvement and am tired of being corrected outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am tired of religion and Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am tired of being individually spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, I am desperate about my condition because I have so little of Your divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have been taught and edified for years.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But still I am what I am.</S>
