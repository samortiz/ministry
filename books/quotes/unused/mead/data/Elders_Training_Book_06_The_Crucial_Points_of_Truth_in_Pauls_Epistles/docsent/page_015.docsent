   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRY OF RECONCILIATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A very crucial point, the ministry of reconciliation, is found in 2 Corinthians 5:16-21.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Reconciliation is in two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first veil is called the screen Exo 26:37, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This typifies the first step of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second veil Exo 26:31-35; Heb 9:3 still separated him from God who is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This veil needed to be rent that he might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the second step of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First we were sinners in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After being reconciled, passing through the first veil, we became saved persons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From this time we became a new creation v. 17 . However, we may have continued to live in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At most we could only be in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The natural life in the flesh was still there separating us from the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we needed a second step, to be reconciled out of the natural life unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the first step of reconciliation, we were reconciled to God from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this purpose Christ died for our sins 1 Cor 15:3 that they might be forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the objective aspect of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross to be judged by God upon Him for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the second step, we as believers living in the natural life were reconciled to God from the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this purpose Christ died for us the persons that we may live to Him in the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2 Cor 5:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the subjective aspect of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we may become the righteousness of God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the two aspects of His death He has fully reconciled God s chosen people to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not simply to be justified by God, but to be made the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For Christ to become sin is higher than for Christ to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, to be made the righteousness of God is deeper than justification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BETROTHED AS A PURE VIRGIN TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are a number of points in chapters six through ten, but these points should not be considered as crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In considering the crucial points in Paul s Epistles, our standard is very high.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we use the Life-study Messages, it is not necessary to use every message and every part of the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the messages were given as a study of a particular book, every verse was covered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we should focus on the crucial points in the central line of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are the things which are neglected and overlooked by many of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 11:2 Paul says, For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 4 says, For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different gospel, which you did not accept, you bear well with him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 5 Paul referred to the super-apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Super-apostles is an ironic term.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Besides Paul and his co-workers, there were others who taught differently.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul considered that all those different teachings were replacements of the unique Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The unique Husband is Christ in His unique revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Other teachers came in pretending to be even higher than the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, Paul said that they were super, not higher, and that what they taught may become another husband to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To take their teachings is to take another husband.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The enemy is very subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Throughout the centuries many fundamental and scriptural teachings have been used by the enemy to replace Christ and the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These teachings are more subtle than the Judaic teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Judaic teachings of the Old Testament law and genealogy are not so fundamental as so many of the teachings given in past centuries, especially since the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many good fundamental and spiritual teachings all became replacements for the proper revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to Paul these are other husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the super-apostles taught, they also used the name Jesus and the term gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, Paul would not have referred to another Jesus and another gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was very subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This point is very crucial and impresses us with a principle anything that distracts people from the central line and from the focus of God s New Testament economy, even though it may be quite fundamental and scriptural, is a replacement of Christ and of the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If it is a replacement, it is another husband to us as the pure virgins.</S>
