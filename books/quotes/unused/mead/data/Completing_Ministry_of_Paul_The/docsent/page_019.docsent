   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE GROWTH IN LIFE THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2; Phil 2:2; 1 Cor 3:6-12; Eph 4:12-16</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The verses above deal mainly with the matter of life and its issue, which is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is actually the theme of the whole New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Life is simply the Triune God, who, after passing through a lengthy process, became the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As such, He is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The building is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This building comes out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is the issue of the divine life; its ultimate consummation is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once we receive this life, the New Testament tells us, it begins to grow within us, to saturate us, to transform us, and to build us together as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this age His dwelling place is the church; in the eternal age it is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dwelling place is the issue of God s being life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As His life within us grows, we are transformed; the purpose of this transformation is the building up of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Growth, transformation, and building are the crucial points in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nonetheless, they have been largely overlooked by most Christians, who instead pay attention to lesser things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Transformation follows regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our spiritual life began with regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we believed on the Lord Jesus and called on His name, He as the life-giving Spirit entered into our spirit and regenerated it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since then, the Triune God has indwelt our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, in spirit we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now there is the need for Him to spread from our spirit into our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When He as the life-giving Spirit has spread into our soul and saturated it, we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Transformation is the saturation of our soul by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regeneration is a birth in our spirit; transformation, a saturation in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Transformation is a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the physical body metabolism refers to the processes in cells by which old materials are discharged and new are added.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This change, applied to the soul, is called in the New Testament transformation 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To apply makeup may result in a change in appearance, but it is merely an outward, not a metabolic, change.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To have a better skin color because of an improved diet, on the other hand, is the result of a metabolic process.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>New elements are organically assimilated by the body, replacing the old.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Transformation is a change in life, not merely in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The divine element is added to us; this discharges the old human element.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This organic change takes place in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our spirit, then, needs regeneration; our soul, transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In all the churches the saints should be concerned about this metabolic change in life through the spreading of the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN SOUL AND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before we go on, I would like to be sure we are all clear as to the difference between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the center of our being is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Around the spirit is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the outermost part is the body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can illustrate it like this:</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the clear teaching of Scripture that man is tripartite 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nonetheless, there are two schools of theology which have arisen on this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One believes, as the Bible teaches, that man is a trichotomy; that is, he is made up of spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The other school maintains that man is a dichotomy; that is, he has an outer part, the body, and an inner part, the spirit or soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this latter school spirit, soul, and heart are considered synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such an unscriptural view of man is revealed in the New American Standard Version of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Philippians 2:2, where the literal rendering is joined in soul, this version has united in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Again, in Philippians 2:20, where Paul says that Timothy is like-souled lit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>, this version has of kindred spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To translate soul as spirit is inexcusable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It clearly indicates that the translators saw no difference between soul and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A number of Bible teachers do not differentiate between soul and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I once met a missionary from the Brethren who strongly argued with me that there was no difference between soul and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I called his attention to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, where Paul mentions your whole spirit and soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Surely Paul would not have put and between them if they were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To my astonishment, he replied that no matter what the Bible said, spirit and soul were still one and the same!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That was the end of the argument; I told him if he did not believe what the Bible said, there was no point in further talk.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To be born of the Spirit in our spirit is the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our spirit has been regenerated, but the soul is still empty.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The divine, indwelling Spirit expects to spread into our soul, that is, into our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He wants to saturate our inward parts.</S>
