<h2 class="head2">The Vainglory of Life</h2><p>In verse 16 John also mentions the vainglory of life. We have seen that the vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life. Here the Greek word rendered &ldquo;life&rdquo; is <i>bios,</i> a word that refers to physical life, and also to the present life. It differs from the Greek word <i>zoe</i> used in 1:1-2, a word that refers to the divine life.</p><p>In the New Testament three Greek words are used for life: <i>zoe,</i> which refers to the divine life, the life of God; <i>psuche,</i> which refers to our human life, our soulish or psychological life; and <i>bios,</i> which refers to physical life. The Greek word <i>bios</i> also denotes the present life. Hence, the vainglory of life means the vainglory of the present life. Whatever takes place in human society is the present life. With this present, earthly life there is vainglory. This vainglory includes empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONTENTS OF THE SATANIC SYSTEM</h2><p>We have seen that the world in 2:15 denotes an evil, satanic, anti-God system that is constituted of the things created by God. Satan has used these things to form his system. However, these things are not the contents of the satanic world system. This system comprises the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of the present life. For example, God has created different kinds of food. Without food we cannot survive. However, Satan uses food to form a satanic system. This does not mean, however, that food is part of the contents of Satan&rsquo;s evil system.</p><p>Farming and industry are also necessary for human life. It would be impossible for us to survive without farming and industry. Satan has utilized farming and industry in forming his evil system. But these things in themselves are not the contents of the world system formed by Satan. What, then are the contents of the satanic system? The contents of this system are the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life.</p><p>It is not easy to differentiate between the things, matters, and persons used by Satan to constitute his evil system and the actual contents of this world system. Your car and house may be used by Satan to constitute the anti-God world. But neither your car nor your house is part of the contents of Satan&rsquo;s evil system. I would emphasize again that the contents of Satan&rsquo;s system is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of this present life.</p><p>We may use owning a car as an illustration of the difference between something used by Satan to form his system and the actual contents of this system. How can a car be utilized by the enemy of God to form his evil system? The car itself is not a problem and is not the content of Satan&rsquo;s system. The problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and, in particular, with the vainglory of the present life. If it were not for man&rsquo;s vainglory, a car would not become a problem. However, many people like to buy an expensive car in order to make a display. In their case, the car they drive is used for vainglory. In this country a car is a necessity. The problem, therefore, is not with the car itself; the problem is with the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. When you consider a certain kind of car, you may desire to have it. Some may think about a certain car day and night. The car is not wrong&mdash;the persons are wrong. The problem is not with the car they need; the problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life.</p><p>As further illustrations, we may also refer to our need for clothing and housing. A dwelling place is a necessity, and clothing also is a necessity. Once again, the problem is not with the house or the clothes; these are not the actual contents of the world system. The problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life, for these are the contents of Satan&rsquo;s evil system.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO TRINITIES</h2><p>According to the Bible, the world is against the Father (v. 15), the Devil is against the Son (3:8), and the flesh is against the Spirit (Gal. 5:17). On the one hand, we have the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. On the other hand, we have an evil trinity&mdash;the world, Satan, and the flesh. If we enjoy the Divine Trinity, we shall have nothing to do with the evil trinity.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FATHER AND HIS WILL</h2><p>In verse 17 John goes on to say, &ldquo;And the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who practices the will of God abides forever.&rdquo; As the world is against God the Father, so the things in the world (v. 15), which are its lust, are against the will of God. On the positive side, we have the Father and His will. On the negative side, we have the world and all the things in the world. The world is against the Father, and the things in the world are against the will of the Father.</p><p>According to John&rsquo;s word in verse 17, the world is passing away and its lust, but he who practices the will of God abides forever. To practice the will of God is to do the will of God habitually and continually, not merely occasionally. The world, its lust, and those who love the world are passing away. But God, His will, and those who do His will abide forever.</p>
