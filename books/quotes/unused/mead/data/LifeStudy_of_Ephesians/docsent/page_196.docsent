   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESPONDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The dispensing of the Triune God into man is altogether related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The processed God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is waiting for our spirit to respond to Him and to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be saved is not merely to understand the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is to open ourselves from the depths of our being to respond to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we must call from our spirit, from the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do this, we shall be saved, even if we do not adequately understand the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consider the case of Saul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus Acts 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was saved by saying the words, Who art Thou, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time he was saved, Saul was not so clear about the gospel, nor even about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, simply by saying the words, Who art Thou, Lord? he was captured by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows that to be saved is not mainly a matter of understanding the gospel, but of contacting the life-giving Spirit, who is the processed God waiting for an opportunity to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Contacting the life-giving Spirit is much like breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The important thing is not to understand the air, but to breathe the air into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By breathing in the air, we receive all the benefits of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This principle applies to our whole Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Take holiness as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We become holy not by learning the doctrine of holiness, but by contacting the Spirit who Himself is the essence of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The doctrine of holiness is not holiness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Holiness is a living Person, the processed God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is possible to know the doctrine of holiness without having the reality of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way to be holy is to contact the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may read a book on holiness, but have nothing of holiness as a result of our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, if we spend the same amount of time calling on the name of the Lord as we would reading that book, we shall certainly experience God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the book of Ephesians there is great emphasis on the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ephesians 1:17 says, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is disagreement among scholars concerning the translation of the Greek word for spirit in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some insist on capitalizing the word spirit, because they think that the spirit here is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Others believe that the spirit here must refer to the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, the spirit in this verse is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is the human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a spirit is given to us by God so that we may have wisdom and revelation to know Him and His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without the Holy Spirit, our spirit cannot be a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But as soon as the Holy Spirit is mingled with our spirit, our spirit becomes a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>GOD S DWELLING PLACE IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 2:22 Paul again refers to the mingled spirit: In Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Translators differ about this verse also, with some arguing that the spirit here is the divine Spirit and others, that it is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, it is the mingled spirit, the believers human spirit indwelt by God s Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God s Spirit is the indwelling One, not the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The dwelling place is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s Spirit dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Holy Spirit is, therefore, the indwelling One, not the indwelt One.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The dwelling place of God is in our spirit, the human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST REVEALED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 3:5 Paul says that the mystery of Christ has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The spirit here is once again the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit, our spirit becomes the organ in which the mystery of Christ is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 3:16 Paul speaks of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The inner man is our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only way man s spirit can be regenerated is through having the Spirit of God come into it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, the inner man in this verse also denotes the human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
