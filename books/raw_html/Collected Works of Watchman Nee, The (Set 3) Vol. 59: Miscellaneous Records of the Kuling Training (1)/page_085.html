<h2 class="head1">NOT ASSUMING AUTHORITY</h2><p>Those who truly possess authority never have to defend their authority. Nine out of ten persons are prone to touch men, not God. God may or may not have appointed one to be an authority, but it is always unsightly for a man to recommend himself as the authority. In 1 Corinthians the apostles were ranked first, but in 2 Corinthians the apostles were ranked last. In the first book the apostles were the first to be mentioned; this relates to truth. In the second book Paul said they were the last because there he was speaking on his own behalf. Both books are right. The Corinthians despised the apostle, and placed him, who should have been first, in the last place. Paul said that he was indeed the last. When he was attacked, he defended himself by saying that he was less than the least; yet he was not without grace. There are always two sides to every spiritual matter. It is equally wrong for an authority to expect submission from others and for a rebellious man to refuse to submit to him. If Brother Witness comes here, the brothers have to take care that he eats well. However, Brother Witness has to exercise care that he does not eat too well. If the brothers are concerned that Brother Witness is eating too well, they are probably not real brothers. However, if Brother Witness is afraid that he is not eating well enough, that is also wrong. We are here to uphold God's authority, not our own. We must touch the matter of authority before God. If a man only touches authority in man, the care he exercises will be nothing more than a sign of a weak conscience.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO TOUCH AUTHORITY IN A THOROUGH WAY</h2><p>I have said enough. Have we touched God's authority? Every one of us has to settle this question within himself. It is not important whether the policeman is called Chang or Hwang. As a citizen of the state we have seen that we must obey the police. If we are not subdued in this matter, we are useless. In covering the matter of authority, we cannot appoint one or two disobedient persons to go out and preach obedience. It is useless if we only touch men. If we have a craving for others to submit to us, we are still an outsider. I am not here to pass on some teachings about authority. I am not saying that we should take these teachings to others and subject them to our authority. We are for the humbling of our very person. We are concerned with whether or not we have touched authority. An authority is very tolerant of others' offenses. Christ was the greatest authority God ever appointed. Yet He experienced the greatest offense in the whole world. He was offended throughout His life. In the end He was crucified on the cross. Authority belongs to the Lord, not to us. The One who appoints authority is the Lord. If we can prostrate ourselves before God, all of our problems will go away. If we are still craving submission from others and are concerned only about upholding our own authority, we are far from seeing the reality of authority. We cannot be careless or loose in this matter. We have to be absolute. I will not let this matter slip by easily. We have to climb up a high mountain to see this matter. We have to uphold God's authority and testify to this authority. We should never consider how we can be an authority. Rather, we should learn submission and turn away from rebellion. We need to learn to drain out every drop of our rebellious blood. I hope that we will spend more time praying alone or in small groups. I hope that we will deal with this matter thoroughly. May we clearly see the principle of authority and submission as it is displayed in Christ. It is wonderful that we can learn authority and submission here! I pray that we will rise above the clouds and see everything clearly. May the Lord be gracious to us.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD</h2><p>I have an additional word. First Corinthians 16:16 says, "You also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring." Who are the "such ones"? We should look back at verse 15: "Now I exhort you, brothers: You know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister to the saints." This means that anyone who has gone before us in the Lord should be an object of our submission. Concerning the house of Stephanas, the emphasis here is that they were given to minister to the saints. Although they might not have been that old, the believers should have submitted to them on account of their seniority. First Timothy 5:17 says, "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching." We should obey the elders who take the lead in the church. First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble." Those who are younger should be subject to the elders, and everyone should be subject one to another.</p>
