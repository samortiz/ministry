   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SOLUTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 15:22-33 describes the solution to the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, this solution was a compromise, but it was better than nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 23 through 29 give an account of the letter that was written by those in Jerusalem and sent with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 26 we are told that Barnabas and Saul were men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Literally, the Greek word rendered lives means souls.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This word refers not only to their lives, but also to their very being, which they had given up for the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verses 30 and 31 say, So when they were dismissed, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude together, they handed them the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And when they read it, they rejoiced at the consolation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, the believers in Antioch rejoiced because it was not necessary for them to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, they still had to observe certain requirements of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fox of the law had been buried, but the tail was still visible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The solution, therefore, was actually a compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to chapter eighteen of Acts, not even Paul was fully free from the Judaic influence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 18 says, Paul, having remained there yet a considerable number of days, took leave of the brothers and sailed away to Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was a private vow that could be performed in any place by the Jews for thanksgiving with the shearing of the hair.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It differed from the Nazarite vow, which had to be carried out in Jerusalem with the shaving of the head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul was a Jew and he kept the vow, but he did not impose it on the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the principle of his teaching concerning God s New Testament economy, Paul should have given up all the Jewish practices which belonged to the Old Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, he still had such a private vow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I find it hard to believe that Paul, the writer of Romans and Galatians, could still keep this vow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In principle, Paul was wrong in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, he was not nearly as wrong as James was in Acts 21.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we shall see, the Lord did not tolerate Paul s joining those who had made a Nazarite vow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The point we are emphasizing here is that the solution to the problem in Acts 15 was a compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The problem was solved, and the turmoil was calmed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the root of the poison was not cut.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the root was allowed to remain, it appears again in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The mixture we see in Acts 21 was already present in Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a religious mixture, a mixture of God s New Testament economy with the Judaic religion of the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This mixture was the result of compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this compromise, the problem in Acts 15 was not fully solved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, this partial solution was better than nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>LEARNING TO FACE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>TODAY S COMPROMISING SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In principle, the situation today is the same as that in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is still a great deal of compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we are studying the Bible not merely to learn doctrine, but also to be warned and to be trained to face the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1964 I wrote some hymns on Christ being the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day a friend of mine, who was a co-worker, said to me, Yes, the New Testament does say that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we teach this, Christians will not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is better for us not to teach that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I said to this brother, Justification by faith was recovered through Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Catholic Church was opposed to this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If Luther had decided not to teach justification by faith because the Catholic Church was not willing to accept it, how could there ever have been the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some who were once among us in the Lord s recovery have compromised Brother Nee s teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They know what he taught, but because they are afraid of traditional Christianity, they do not dare to teach the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, they compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In translating certain of Brother Nee s books, the translator has even changed some of his words in order not to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1964 I was invited to speak, for the fourth or fifth time, to a particular Christian group in Dallas.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My host warned me saying, Brother Lee, please do not talk about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The people here will not accept your teaching concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we welcome you to minister on Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We like this, and we are helped by it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without saying either yes or no to this brother s request, I replied, Brother, as long as I minister Christ as life, the issue will be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How can you ask me to minister Christ and expect that this will not issue in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I went on to tell him that my ministry is a ministry of Christ, and the issue of this ministry will always be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I spent a week ministering to that Christian group in Dallas.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I did not speak on the church until the last night of the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My speaking spirit could no longer bear for me to be silent regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I did not care whether I would be invited back again.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I knew I had to say a word about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I asked those attending the meeting to turn to Romans 12, my host knew that I intended to speak concerning the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who invited me were disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Nevertheless, I went on to give a strong word concerning the church, and through that message someone was gained for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All these cases teach us to beware of compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May we all learn from our study of Acts how to face today s compromising situation.</S>
