   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FOUR THE CHURCH THE FELLOWSHIP AMONG THE CHURCHES 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to consider the fellowship among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>B. All the Churches Being the One Universal Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the churches are the one universal Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The one Body, the one universal church, comprises all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There may be thousands of local churches, but together they constitute one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each local church is a part of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Ephesians 4:4 Paul says, "One Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body is mentioned before the Spirit because the oneness among us is related to the Body and is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, this verse not only reveals the uniqueness of the Body; it also shows that the one Body is determined by the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because there is one Spirit, there is one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is not another Body because there is not another Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must keep the unique oneness of the Body because the Body and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is the essence of the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without the Spirit, the Body is empty and has no life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Body in Ephesians 4:4 is the Body of Christ, and the essence of the Body of Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the Body and the essence of the Body are one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is impossible for the Body of Christ to have more than one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The unique essence of the Body is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because there is one Spirit, there is only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, there is only one circulation, one fellowship, of life in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This circulation is the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the local churches need to be in this unique fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Among Them There Being No Organization but the Fellowship of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Among all the churches that compose the one universal Body of Christ, there is no organization, but there is the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that in the proper church life there is no organization, but there is much fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just as the human body does not have organization but does have circulation, so we should not have organization, but we should have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If all the churches stay in this circulation, in the fellowship of the Body, they will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the natural human thought is either to have organization or to have nothing to do with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, we should not have any organization among the churches; on the other hand, we should be open to have fellowship with all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the church in a certain locality or the churches in a particular region may not be willing to have fellowship with other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This attitude is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the churches should remain in the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the Churches Being on the Same Level, None Being the Head Church, nor Any Ruling Over Another, as Indicated by the Seven Churches in Revelation Chapters One through Three</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As indicated by the seven churches in Revelation 1 through 3, all the churches are on the same level, with none being the head church, nor any ruling over another.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Among the seven churches in the book of Revelation, there is no church that is above the other churches and no church that is below the others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no thought of higher or lower.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, all the churches are on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, the churches are identical, each being a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fact that the churches are identical indicates a prevailing fellowship among the churches, for without fellowship it is impossible for the churches to be identical.</S>
