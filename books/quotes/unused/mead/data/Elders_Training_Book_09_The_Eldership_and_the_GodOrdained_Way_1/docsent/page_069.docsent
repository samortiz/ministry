   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT DOING A ROUTINE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT ENDEAVORING AND LABORING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of us who are elders and co-workers must endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must learn from the Apostle Paul who labored day and night and who served the Lord with tears Acts 20:31, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul indicated in his Epistles to both Timothy and Titus that they had to stay to teach and train the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Brother Nee's book Church Affairs, he points out that after the elders are established, they need to be perfected by the apostles who established them pp.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He points out that there is the need to show the elders how to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Nee saw this and practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day when I was with him, he told me, "Witness, we have the blueprint in our hand."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This meant that he had the plan for building up a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While I was with him in Shanghai, I saw something, I learned, and I received the perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then I went back to Chefoo and practiced what I saw.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I stayed in Chefoo from 1940 through 1942, and at the end of 1942, a big revival broke forth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to my observation of the situation of the churches in the United States, most of the elders are groping because they have not been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because I have been so busy in traveling to different churches and in the editing of many publications, I have not had the time to stay in one place to be with the saints for an extended period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have had to put out many books to supply the churches with the spiritual food, the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What should we do in our present situation as elders and co-workers?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By His mercy, we must see a clear view of how the Lord, in His New Testament economy, builds up the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He builds up the churches first by giving gifted persons to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He uses these gifted persons to perfect all the saints, and the perfected saints do the direct building work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We elders and co-workers should be the gifted persons, yet we may not know how to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why we must endeavor to learn the truths and endeavor to fellowship with one another concerning how to perfect a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Immediately after someone gets baptized, we have to consider how we can keep him and perfect him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may have baptized many new ones in the past, but very few of them remained because no one went back to them again and again to perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To do this requires much labor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of laboring, we like to do a routine work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A company, a factory, or a corporation does not make money through its routine workers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I was told a story concerning the Honda corporation that illustrates this point.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In one of their big office buildings, there were many Americans in a big office space doing routine work eight hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That work helped the corporation, no doubt, but the real money was made due to the fact that a small number of Japanese in a back office stayed late into the night to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is also true that in the best colleges, the professors must labor hard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a slogan in the universities that says, "Publish or perish."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to put this slogan on our wall to remind us that we have to endeavor to learn something.</S>
