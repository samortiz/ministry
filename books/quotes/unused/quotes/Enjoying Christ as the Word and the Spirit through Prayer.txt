The Bible reveals that God is our enjoyment and that all the riches of God, what God is in His fullness, are the riches of Christ
In order to know the riches of Christ, we have to know the Word, which is the revelation of all that Christ is
We have to exercise our spirit to realize all that God is in Christ through the Holy Spirit and as revealed in the Word
These five items- God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Word, and our spirit-are the factors of our enjoyment of God
Christ is first revealed as the Word, and in His resurrection He was transferred from the Word into the Spirit
In order to know the Scriptures and to know life, we must be familiar with and very clear about all these principles
Otherwise, no matter how many times we read the Word, we will read it in a blind and foolish way, and it will never be clear to us
In the beginning, in eternity before the foundation of the world, He was the Word, and in time He came in incarnation
According to the letter of the Bible many Christians know that Christ is life but not many can say how Christ can be life to us practically
It is when the word is transferred into the Spirit that it becomes life, because it is not the words directly but the Spirit who gives life
Peter, James, John, and all the early disciples beheld the glory of this living Person, and in this way they 'read' Him
When they came down from the mountain, those who took up the temple tax came to Peter and asked him whether or not Jesus paid the tax
The Lord said, 'But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up
It must have been the Lord's intention at that time to educate the foolish Peter not to say anything when the tax gatherer came
Some of what the disciples read of the Lord was His spoken words but some of what they read were the living walk and acts of the Lord Jesus
The four Gospels reveal Christ as the living Word, whom the disciples read day by day for three and a half years
In our own experience, however, we need to see how we can practically enjoy Christ as the Word transferred into the Spirit
The way to transfer Christ as the Word into the Spirit is to open our heart, open our spirit, and exercise our spirit to pray
In the four Gospels there is the Word who was 'read' by the early disciples, and in the Acts there is the Spirit
In verse 22 Peter said concerning the selection of Matthias, 'One of these should become a witness of His resurrection with us'
The disciples must have realized that for them to be the Lord's witnesses required that Christ be wrought into them
The one hundred and twenty had given up their homes, their relatives, their jobs, their goals, their fame, and their everything
The Lord had told them that they would be His witnesses, but they could not be His witnesses without being filled with Him
It was by this prayer, praying what they had been reading of Christ as the Word, that what they read was transferred into the Spirit
Jesus was one with Peter, John, James, and all the disciples, because He was not only the Word but also the Spirit
The proper way to have a message meeting is that after the message we leave time for all the brothers and sisters to pray together
It also laid a good foundation for the church in Manila so that even today two-thirds of the members in the church are young people
We should not have too much singing; rather, we need more prayer to dig our heart, prepare our heart, and open our spirit
We can have a time for the ministry of the word, and when we speak the word, it will be living and will strike the spirit of the hearers
In the four Gospels the early disciples had the Word for three and a half years, but they did not yet have the Spirit
It was through their prayer for ten days that Christ was transferred to them in their experience as the Spirit
From that time on they became a praying people, dealing not only with the Word but also with Christ as the life-giving Spirit
After His resurrection and ascension, from the book of Acts through all the Epistles, the Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit
We need to know the Lord as the Word, the expression, the revelation, the manifestation, of God, but we need more than this
After we know Him as the Word, we need Him to be transferred into the Spirit that we may not only know Him but also experience Him
In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus is revealed as the Word, the expression, the manifestation, of God for us to know
Whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him'
When we speak it to others, it becomes the word again, and when they receive it, it becomes the Spirit to them
If we receive the word only in our mind, it is knowledge in letter, but when we receive the word into our spirit, it becomes Spirit
In order to keep the message that we have heard and been inspired by, we must immediately pray the message into our spirit
Many times when we read the word, we gain knowledge and understanding in the mind, but we are not nourished within
In reading, listening, and fellowshipping we have come to know many things, and we have been truly inspired, but we have neglected to pray
If we read all these verses together, we can see that praying has very much to do with our thanksgiving to God
Verse 17 tells us to pray unceasingly, verse 18 tells us to give thanks in everything, and verse 19 says to not quench the Spirit
Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist, is a good example of a priest, going into the temple to burn the incense and to pray
The only fire that could be used to burn the incense was the fire from the altar of burnt offering, the heavenly fire that came from God
The blood shed upon the offering altar is brought into the Holy Place to be sprinkled upon the four corners of the incense altar
That was a work to serve God, but that kind of service was different from the service of those who burned the incense
To serve God in the outer court as a Levite is one kind of service but to serve as a priest burning incense to God directly is another thing
According to the record of the Bible, it is hard to discern whether the incense altar is outside the veil or within the veil before the ark
In typology this signifies that when we begin to pray, we are mostly in the soul and only a little in the spirit
According to the proper spiritual interpretation, the incense altar is for general prayer, but the censer is for special prayers
In today's Christianity there is much outward activity, but there is not much inward contact with the Lord to burn the incense
Hebrews 10:19 through 22 exhorts us to enter into the Holy of Holies, and 4:16 encourages us to touch the throne of grace
We look to the Lord for changing the way we have our meetings, but if we are not a praying people, we can have only formal meetings
If we change the way we meet, but our meetings are not living, they will be meetings full of stench, like a cemetery full of death
We have Matthew 6:33 as a promise: If we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, He will add to us whatever we need
The word which we receive will become the Spirit in our spirit, and when the word becomes the Spirit, it is life to us
Christ is the very embodiment of God all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily that is all that God is is embodied in Christ
Christ Himself told us that He came as the heavenly bread of life for us to eat and the living water for us to drink
In the Gospel of John, God is expressed and revealed through the life and walk of the Lord Jesus while He was on this earth
If someone were to remain with us morning to evening, day and night, we eventually would 'read' him in a thorough way
In order to know Christ we have to know Him as the Word and in order to experience Christ we have to experience Him as the lifegiving Spirit
Christ being the Word is for our knowing Him; Christ being the Spirit is for our enjoying and experiencing Him
All of a sudden something seems to come upon him from the heavens, and he jumps, laughs, rolls, and changes his voice to speak in tongues
Now we have to exercise our human spirit as the organ with which to contact Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him in a living and inward way
Rather, the New Testament corresponds to those who realize and enjoy that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit
In order to have a proper Christian life, we need to know how to deal with Christ as the Word and as the life-giving Spirit day by day
If we come to the Bible only by exercising our eyes and mind to understand it, the word is still only the word
A believer may read Matthew 1:1, which says, 'The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham'
We will come to the meeting to listen to the ministry of the word, carefully watching for what the speaker says about David
Someone may take this word as knowledge and even criticize, saying that this does not sound like a proper teaching in the Bible
In order to pray to transfer the word into the Spirit, we must learn how to exercise, release, and uplift our spirit
At first we may not get something from what we read, but later when we return to that same passage, we will receive something from it
We all need to practice this way to receive the word, because we are accustomed to receiving something of knowledge
Even if it is easy to get something merely of knowledge from a certain portion of the word, we would not do it
If we come to a 'bone,' we can forget about it for now and go on to a tender, meaty portion to get something of life
When we come to the meetings, it will be easy to pray, because our spirit has been exercised, strengthened, and uplifted
We will have something stored within our spirit, and our spirit will be living, because day by day we have been feeding on Christ
The more we practice to exercise our spirit to pray with the word we read, the more we will be adjusted and learn how to do it
We may speak to the Lord in a spontaneous way, 'Lord, not only are You Yourself life, but even Your commandment is eternal life
One day we can read the first eight verses, and the next day we can continue from verse 9 and read another five or ten verses
Other seed fell on the rocky place, where it did not have much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth
We must take the word as truth, not merely as knowledge, and realize that the word must be transferred into the Spirit
He said, 'In the whole world there is not another book like this which teaches that wives have to submit to their husband'
Enlarge your tent site Let them stretch out the curtains of your habitations Spare not Lengthen your cords And strengthen your pegs
The more we speak them, the more we will taste, enjoy, and absorb not mere knowledge but the Lord Himself as life and nourishment
There is a great difference between the way of knowledge and the way of life to realize the word, to make the word living in the spirit
If we practice to come to the word properly, the Holy Spirit will come in, and many things will result in a living way
We need to practice to exercise our spirit and train our faculties to be accustomed to this kind of reading and praying
When we come together to meet, we will have a strong, living spirit and the accumulation of divine content within us
In reading the four Gospels, we should pay attention not mainly to what He did, but to go further to see what He is
The four GospelsMatthew Mark Luke and Johngive us a full picture of this wonderful Christ as the Word the expression and revelation of God
As the Word Christ is in the stage of revelation expression and explanation and as the Spirit He is in the stage of enjoyment and experience
In the same way, and especially since we are taking the way of the Lord's recovery, we cannot simply repeat what others say
We have to thoroughly know the truth concerning Christ as the Word and the Spirit and be able to give adequate answers concerning it
The light, confirmation, and adequate, proper, and strong proofs of this truth should flow out of us like a waterfall
Rather, there is another category of expressions concerning Christ, because in the Epistles Christ is revealed as the Spirit
They can say, 'Christ is God, and He is man' merely with their knowledge, but they have few experiences of Christ
On the first page of the New Testament is an explanation, a revelation, of the person of Christ, telling us who He is
According to the principle of first mention, this establishes that the subject of the Gospels is the person of Christ
When we fill out papers about our status, we have to tell people about our parents, nationality, and date and place of birth
After His genealogy and birth, the Gospels present the recommendation of Christ by His forerunner, John the Baptist
In the second book, as a man He is a slave serving not only God but also us, with power, love, and even His own life
He was among people to be seen, understood, and apprehended, but He could not come into people for them to enjoy
The disciples needed the Lord's second step so that He could become the Spirit to be not only among them but in them
Is the fact that Christ was one with all His disciples, because Christ as the living Spirit was in all His disciples
Verse 17 of chapter three says, 'The Lord is the Spirit,' and 4:7 says that Christ is the treasure in us, the earthen vessels
Next, Ephesians 3:16 and 17 is a prayer that our inner man be strengthened and that Christ would make His home in our heart
Colossians 1:27 says, 'Christ in you, the hope of glory,' 3:4 speaks of 'Christ our life,' and verse 11 says, 'Christ is all and in all'
There is no need to glean this kind of passage; there is a full harvest of these passages in the New Testament
Verse 8 says And to the messenger of the church in Smyrna write These things says the First and the Last who became dead and lived again
The beginning of every epistle says that the Lord speaks, but the end of each epistle says that the Spirit speaks
The Lamb is on the throne, from the throne flows the river of water of life, and in the water of life grows the tree of life
We must not exercise only our mind to understand Him we have to exercise our spirit to contact Him in our spirit as revealed in the Epistles
Verses 21 and 22 continue, 'Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ: Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord'
When we are filled with Christ and enjoying Christ to the fullest extent, something flows out from this filling within
In the same principle, the word is spiritual food, food for the spirit, so we have to eat it with our spirit and take it into our spirit
We must learn to pray, not in a formal way by composing a prayer but in an informal way, just as we talk with our loved ones
We cannot expect a brother to be normal and healthy in his Christian life if he does not know how to eat the Lord by dealing with the word
We may have messages on the cross and about many other things, but we still need to feed on the Lord, drink of Him, and feast on Him
At other times we may need to exercise our mind by reading, but our time for eating the word is not for exercising our mind
If we read a few verses or even half of a chapter and do not understand it, we should leave it and continue to read
It is by this kind of prayer that we have a fresh contact not only with the word but also with the Lord Himself through the word
If you need to close your eyes, close them spontaneously, but if you do not need to close them, do not make that a form
It is not very easy to apply a passage like this, except if under the Lord's sovereignty we have a case like the psalmist's
In the same way, when we read and pray with the word, we should not read too quickly, and neither should we compose formal prayers
Simply by feasting on the Lord in this way, the inner supply and nourishment will take care of all our problems
Exodus 30:7 and 8 say, 'And Aaron shall burn on it fragrant incense; every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it
When Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations'
That is, whenever we deal with the word in a proper way to receive light, we have to pray and offer incense to God
It is only by this kind of prayer that the word we read and understand can be transferred into the Spirit and become life to us
From now on, we should read the word in this way and help others to contact the Lord day by day by reading in such a way
We need to exercise the spirit to bring ourselves into the presence of the Lord and speak something in His presence directly, face to face
Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheepgate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes'
The more we practice the living way to read the word, the more we will be genuinely spiritual and the less we will be formal and religious
Even the worldly people who do not know Christ and are against Christ, when they read this portion will say, 'This widow is right
If we come to understand the word in a religious way, we need not read the word at all, because we already have a religious concept
To exercise our spirit and deny our self includes dropping all our natural and religious concepts when we come to the word
Even though we know not for what we should pray, the Spirit intercedes within us and for us, many times with unutterable groanings
If we do not know how to deal with the Word in a proper way, in the way of life, we can never enjoy Christ adequately
In praying we work together with Christ, giving Him the ground and the opportunity to work out something through us
Even while we are driving our car or cooking in the kitchen we can breathe by calling from deep within, 'O Lord'
Christ is in us and we need to have the prayer as the censer, the bowls, the container, for the indwelling Christ as the incense
If we are not at peace concerning our personal needs, we can remind the Lord to feed us and care for us according to His Word
Do not pray according to what you think you have to pray, but ask the Lord what He wants you to pray in your prayer
Verse 16 says, 'And the men rose up from there, and looked down upon Sodom; and Abraham walked with them to send them away'
Verses 22 and 23 say, 'And the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before the Lord
The Lord reveals His heart to us, we know His intention, and His intention becomes our burden, which returns to the Lord as our intercession
The Lord's desired intention in His heart was to save Lot from Sodom, but the Lord needed someone to pray for Lot
We should ask, 'When we ended our prayer and said amen, did we end our speaking or did the Lord end His speaking'?
We should open ourselves to the Lord, look to Him, and seek His face to behold Him, adore Him, worship Him, praise Him, and thank Him
After we have spent twenty or twenty-five minutes to enjoy the Lord by dealing with His word, we need a time simply to pray
We have realized many things concerning the Lord, so we simply should express something in prayer from our inner realization
The adoration, worship, praise, and thanks that we render to the Lord are the expressions of our inner realization
In the first one or two weeks of our practice to pray in this way, we may define and compose our words very neatly
When we pray, we have to concentrate all our strength in our spirit to speak something: 'O Lord, what a mercy!
When a young brother first begins to minister, he often prepares an introduction and each part of the message in a proper composition
As he advances, however, he leaves this kind of formality behind and speaks to people in a more effective and releasing way
If we see a building on fire, we would not say to our neighbor, 'My dear friend, you must know that there is a fire close by'
If the dear brothers among us would take this word to practice to pray from our inner realization, our prayer will be much improved
Wherever we are, we can simply express something to the Lord: 'O Lord, what a strengthening throughout my whole afternoon!
The more we pray in this way, the more we will be strengthened, the more we will enjoy Him, and the more we will absorb Him
We must learn to pray by exercising our spirit to express something, not by exercising our mind to compose something
We should not compose anything but simply express something from within according to our realization and sense
To pray in the way of expressing our realization however requires boldness strength in the spirit and deliverance from selfconsciousness
The more living our prayer is, the shorter the wording will be and the less natural reasoning there will be in our utterance
Most of the time our prayer in the meetings should be living, strong, and short to express something of our realization of the Lord
We need to practice these two matters: to contact the Lord by dealing with the word, and to pray in this new way to enjoy Him
In this message we will consider the proper way to enjoy the Lord, partake of Him, and intercede by expressing His burden in prayer
It is from this enjoyment that the proper living of husbands wives children parents servants and masters issue forth in the Christian life
After this, Ephesians tells us that we are entitled and burdened to fight the battle to deal with the enemy of God
When we are filled with the Lord and enjoy Him, we have all the proper items of the Christian life as an issue of this enjoyment
Jude 20 says, 'But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit'
While the Lord was enjoying that, He told Abraham what He would do for his wife Sarah, in that she would bring forth a son
When the Lord and the two angels began to leave, Abraham was not willing to lose His presence, so he escorted them for a certain distance
Verses 16 through 24 say, 'And the men rose up from there and looked down upon Sodom; and Abraham walked with them to send them away
Within the heart of the Lord there was a burden, and at this time the Lord found the right person to share this burden with
That would have been the end of their contact, and no burden for intercession would have been revealed to Abraham
When we come to the Lord, we need to forget about those things and not be burdened for anything other than the Lord Himself
These, of course, are very good and devoted Christians, and sometimes the Lord works sovereignly through this kind of prayer
If there is a hole in the glass or a crack in a board, the air can force itself in, but that is a poor way to let the air in
Similarly, the best way to pray is to 'open our windows' to heaven, that is, to open ourselves to the Lord and contact Him
The sisters are busy with cooking, washing, and many things, but they cannot say that they have no time to breathe
If we are not clear about what specifically is wrong, we should tell the Lord that we are under His blood, and we apply its cleansing
After we enjoy the Lord, there will spontaneously be a deep sense within us, and we will have a burden to pray
We will forget our own affairs, problems, burdens, and troubles, and gradually we will have the burden of intercession
We see this kind of speaking in the prayer of Samuel's mother and the praise of Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus
We should forget our natural mentality and learn to sense something of the Lord within, exercising the inner sense to speak something to Him
Rather, when we sense something in our spirit, in the depths of our being, we should express it in a brief way
It is sufficient simply to utter something from within us with simple words and phrases, without any composition
To pray for many different matters without focusing on a real burden may indicate that our practice is merely religious
The young man considered whether or not he could learn anything if he did not speak, but eventually he agreed to the condition
He remained under that tutor for three years until one day the tutor told him, 'Now speak to express your feeling'
If the student had been allowed to express himself for those three years, that would have been a frustration to his learning
We will have a burden that comes out of our being filled with the Lord, and we can utter and express something of the Lord
