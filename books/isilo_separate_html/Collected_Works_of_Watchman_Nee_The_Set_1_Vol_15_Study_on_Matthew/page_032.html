For truly I say to you, You shall by no means finish the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes." "Flee." This is the principle for Christians in suffering persecution. It is to flee, not to resist. It is wrong to say that this verse means that the Son of Man would come back before the disciples had finished the cities of Israel. In fact, when the twelve disciples went forth to preach the gospel, they were not persecuted in such a way. Rather, many people followed them. Therefore, according to history, these things are not yet fulfilled. If we compare the situation here to that in Matthew 24, they are quite similar. Therefore, this word here refers to the great tribulation.</P><P>This was the first time the Lord sent the disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens to the Jews. After His resurrection He sent the disciples to preach the gospel of grace. During the great tribulation, the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens will again be preached, because after the fullness of the Gentiles comes, God will prepare the Jews for the kingdom. We may thus see that God's order is: from the Jews, to the Gentiles, and then back to the Jews.</P><P>Verse 24:"A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his master." This refers specifically to sufferings.</P><P>Verse 25:"It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!" The Lord was reproached to the uttermost. No matter how much a Christian suffers, he could not suffer more than the Lord. This gives us comfort, for the Lord knows all that we may encounter on the earth. He tells us that our sufferings are, at most, the same as His. In the name Beelzebul, Beel means either "fly" or "house," and zebul means "king" or "lord." In other words, Beelzebul means "the king of flies" or "the king of the house." Demons possess the human body, considering it as a house; they occupy the human body as the king of the house. People revile the Lord by calling Him the king of flies, and they call us lunatics.</P><P>In this portion of the Word the Lord shows us that we should not expect people to treat us well on this earth. Every time we are misunderstood, persecuted, or despised, we should remember how people treated our Lord. It is sufficient for us if we become like Him.</P><P>Verse 26:"Therefore do not fear them; for there is nothing covered which will not be revealed, and hidden which will not be made known." The word spoken here gives a principle, a formula, and does not refer to any specific situation. It is the same as Matthew 7:8.</P><P>Verse 27:"What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops." The word spoken here is a detailed explanation and an application of verse 26. It is just like Matthew 7:7, which is a detailed explanation and an application of Matthew 7:8. Matthew 7:8 is a principle and for that reason it begins with the word "for." So it is in this section. Because of verse 26, we should practice the proclaiming mentioned in verse 27.</P><P>On the one hand, verse 26 explains the reason for not fearing. This word has two meanings: (1) What you secretly hold fast for the Lord, even if you are misunderstood to the extent that you are considered the king of demons, will be out in the open one day, for God will make it manifest. (2) The hidden hatred, jealousy, evil plots, and sins in man will also be revealed one day.</P><P>On the other hand, verse 26 states that there is such a principle. Therefore, the Lord speaks the word in verse 27. No one can be a Christian in secret. Because of such a principle given in verse 26, it is most foolish to be a Christian in secret. No Christian who denies the Lord can enter into the kingdom. We may thus see that verse 26 connects the section before with the section following.</P><P>Verse 28:"And do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna." Those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul are people who are used by Satan. The greatest harm Satan can do is to kill man's body only. To "kill the soul" is to cause man to have no enjoyment. "Destroy," or "corrupt," refers to the suffering of punishment in the kingdom age. From verse 28 on, we know that if one commits sins after being saved, he will still receive punishment in the kingdom age, a punishment which is like that of Gehenna. "Do not fear those" here is the same as "do not fear them" in verse 26.</P><P>Verse 29:"Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father." "An assarion" may be accurately rendered "a penny," meaning the least expensive. "Without your Father's permission" [this is the Chinese Mandarin Version's rendering for "apart from your Father"-Translator's note] is different from "unless your Father permits." "Without permission" implies the involvement of other parties-when men or demons try to harm us, God, who is beside us, will not give them permission. On the other hand, "your Father permits" may indicate that the Father voluntarily permits something to happen to us; it seems that God is the One who initiates it. Madam Guyon said that everything that happens to us in our environment is permitted by God. However, Jessie Penn-Lewis said that Madam Guyon was in danger of falling into passivity.</P><P>God remembers things that are so small because He cares about the smallest things, He is the greatest One. The most powerful person is also one who is most able to endure.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
