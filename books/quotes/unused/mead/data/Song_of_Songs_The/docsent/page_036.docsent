   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CALL FOR ASCENSION 4:7-15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 4:1-5 show the outward appearance of the maiden, whereas verses 7 through 15 show the maiden's inward relationship with the King.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. The Calling 4:7-8</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are the words of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All Bible expositors agree that this part refers to ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 7 says, "Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the maiden has seen the cross and resurrection in a deeper and fuller way, the King says to her, "Thou art all fair...there is no spot in thee."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Formerly, the King only said that she was fair; now he says that she is all fair.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All her spots have been removed by the cross; she lost them one by one through her dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is left in her is just the Lord's heavenly and holy life, which is fully on the new ground of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we see that she is all fair.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 8 says, "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the second section, the King asked two things of her: 1 that she would rise up, and 2 that she would go with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After she was dealt with by the Lord, she rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But she has not yet learned to follow the Lord in His move and work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once the Lord makes a demand, He will never lower His standard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes we can delay His timing, and sometimes His time may not be yet, but He never changes His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we have passed through His dealings, and when His time comes, He will again say, "Come with me."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now the Lord calls her to ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many people think that this is a call to leave Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Personally, I believe that this is a poetic expression, and although it says to come "from" Lebanon, there is no reason she should leave Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, in the following verses, part of the new experiences of the maiden relate to the smell of Lebanon and the streams of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lebanon that is referred to here is a high mountain; it is the place where cedar is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, it signifies the nobleness of the cedar wood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Bible, a high mountain often signifies a separation from the earth and a heavenly place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, this call is a call for ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>More accurately stated, this call is a call to the believers to stand on the ground of ascension and to look down from such ground.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, this is a vision of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A believer's stand should be on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although many people have failed, the place the Lord has assigned for them is still the heavenly mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the mountaintop heaven is near.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Indeed, heaven is all around.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the mountaintop the earth is far away and detached.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The three mountaintops indicate that even in the heavenly place, there are still different peaks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is more than one peak, and there is much ground for movement; one is not bound.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Amana" means truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can look down from this peak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can dwell on the peak of all the real things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Shenir" means a soft armor, which signifies the armor given to us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The thought in this verse is totally related to warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We often need to consider the things down below with a full view of the heavenly warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Hermon" means destruction, which refers to Christ's victory on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is the Son of God manifested to destroy all the works of the devil 1 John 3:8b .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can prevail in all warfare to deal with all the worldly affairs from the peak of victory.</S>
