   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God does not want us to live by our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not try to excuse our disposition by saying, I was born this way.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The goal of the Lord s recovery is not to recover any particular doctrine or practice but to recover Christ as the Spirit in our spirit for the church life and every aspect of our daily life, including our family life, school life, and job life.</S>
