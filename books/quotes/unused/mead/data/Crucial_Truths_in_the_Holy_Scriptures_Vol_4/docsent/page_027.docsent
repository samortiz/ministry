   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we want to know God s salvation, we must know the matters related to being in Adam and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN GOD S EYES THERE BEING ONLY TWO MEN Adam Being the First Man, the First Adam</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first man is Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible calls him the first man and the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is out of the earth, so he is earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the beginning of man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the first man and the first Adam because before him there was no man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the people in the world are his descendants, and everyone is out of him; thus, everyone is in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although his descendants number in the millions, in God s view Adam and we as his descendants are just one man because we are out of him and in him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every person in the world is one with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone has come out of Adam and is a part of Adam.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone together equals Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although every person is an individual, every person is Adam because everyone is a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Strictly speaking, our name is Adam because we are out of Adam and in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, in God s eyes Adam and his descendants are one man, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the first man, Adam is the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ Being the Second Man, the Last Adam</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second man is out of heaven ; The last Adam 1 Cor 15:47, 45 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible speaks of Christ as the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This may seem a little peculiar because, according to our thought, Cain was the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the Bible says that the second man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is God s view.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In God s eyes the only man after Adam is Christ because there was only one man before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apart from Adam, there was no other man before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, in God s eyes Adam is the first man, and Christ is the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Corinthians 15 Christ is called not only the second man but also the last Adam, or the last man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This tells us that in God s eyes, Christ is not only the second man but also the last man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After Christ there is no other man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although there is one man before Christ, there is not another man after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Adam is the first man; Christ is the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In God s eyes, just as there was no man before Adam, there is no man after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, there is no man between Adam and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in God s view there are only two men in the universe Adam and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we want to thoroughly know and accurately experience God s way of salvation, we must see that there are only two men in the universe Adam and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Apart from these two men, there is not another man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In God s eyes every person in the world is either in Adam or in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are not in Adam, we are in Christ because there is not a third man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is God s vision.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is God s point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must have God s vision and God s point of view to thoroughly know and to accurately experience His way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May the Lord open our eyes to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>IN ADAM Man s Being in Adam</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He made from one every nation of men Acts 17:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some ancient manuscripts use the phrase one man instead of one in this verse.</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The first thing that man has received from Adam is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Through Adam sin has come to every man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are not sinful because we have committed sins; we were constituted sinners in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Before we even committed a sin, we had a sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because of the disobedience of Adam, we have sin, and we have been constituted as sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Adam became a sinner through disobedience, and since we are in him, we have sin and are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We do not need to commit a sin in order to be a sinner, because we were born as sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After Korea was defeated by Japan, the children who were born in Korea were also defeated because their country was no longer their own.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They lost their country because their forefathers lost their country.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Before they were even born, they were in a country that their fathers and grandfathers had lost.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, they were born as people without their own country.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Similarly, we are descendants of Adam, and as his descendants, we are sinners because of his disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It does not matter whether or not we have committed sins ourselves, we are sinners because we are in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As long as we are in Adam and born of Adam, we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In Adam we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We do not become sinners when we sin; that is, we do not become sinners because we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>First, we are sinners, and then we commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We commit sins because we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are sinners, so we commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We spontaneously sin because we are sinners; there is no exception to this fact.</S>

   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It bears oranges because it is an orange tree.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the same way, we commit sins because we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We inherited our status as sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We commit sins because of what we received from Adam.</S>

   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It was through one offense unto condemnation to all men Rom 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Since we all are sinners in Adam, we also deserve to be condemned because we share in his condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We were included in his one offense in the garden because we were in him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When he sinned in the garden, we also sinned.</S>

   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Chinese people may not feel as if they crossed over the plateau, but when he came, they came in him and with him because they were included in him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Similarly, when Adam sinned in the garden, we were in him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>His sinning was our sinning because we were in him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Thus, his one offense was unto condemnation to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If we see this, we will understand the Lord s word in John 3:18: He who does not believe has been condemned already.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We are in Adam, and when Adam was condemned, we were condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>So just as we obtained sin in Adam, we also inherited condemnation in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Being in Adam causes us to partake of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>3.</S>

   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The result of sin and condemnation is death.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Our death in Adam has several aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The first aspect involves the deadening of our human spirit, in which fellowship with God was broken, and the human spirit lost this function.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The second aspect involves the death of our body, in which our body will lose its life and return to dust.</S>

   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This is the final death and the eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>These are all aspects of death, and they are our common inheritance in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>In Adam we have three terrible things: sin, condemnation, and death.</S>
