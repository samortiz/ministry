         <h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Incarnation</h2>
<p>We can see the meaning of incarnation by looking at several verses. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; Simply put, the Word is God expressed and also the expressed God. The incarnated God is not a hidden God but an expressed God. The expressed God is the Word who became flesh. <em>Flesh</em> does not refer merely to human beings in general but also to mankind after the fall. When the Lord Jesus came to be flesh, man was fallen. Hence, the flesh that He put on refers to fallen man, or we may say that He put on fallen man. When speaking of this truth, we must be very precise.</p>
<p>Romans 8:3 says, &ldquo;God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin.&rdquo; We should point out that even though the expressed God became a man, we should not assume, based on John 1:14 alone, that this expressed God was a sinful man. We must also consider Romans 8:3, which shows that even though He became flesh, He came only in the likeness of a fallen man outwardly without having the fallen nature, the nature of sin inwardly. This is illustrated in the type of the bronze serpent. In John 3:14 the Lord said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; The bronze serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness is a type of the Lord Himself (Num. 21:4-9). The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but not the element of the serpent&rsquo;s poison, the nature of the serpent. After the Lord Jesus became flesh, He had the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sinful nature of fallen man. Romans 8:3 speaks of the likeness of the flesh of sin, which proves that the Lord came in the likeness of the flesh of sin but did not have the nature of sin.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:7 speaks of the Lord taking &ldquo;the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men,&rdquo; and verse 8 says that in His &ldquo;being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.&rdquo; Although God was joined to man and expressed through man in incarnation, He did not have man&rsquo;s sinful nature. Nevertheless, He was a genuine man, not a fake man, becoming, in reality, in the likeness of men.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:14 says, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil.&rdquo; This verse proves that when the Lord was incarnated, He had blood and flesh, the elements of man. First Timothy 2:5 says, &ldquo;There is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The phrase <em>the man</em> is emphatic; it means that the Lord is indeed a man. He is no different from us other than the fact that He is without sin. He became a man and is a man. First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s becoming flesh is God&rsquo;s expression of Himself in the flesh. Except for the fact that He does not have the element of sin, He is the same as every man. He is the manifested God, the God who is expressed in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Issue of Incarnation</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15 speaks of the issue of the incarnation. Verse 45 speaks of a &ldquo;last Adam,&rdquo; and verse 47 speaks of a &ldquo;second man.&rdquo; This shows that the Lord is the last man as well as the second man. From these two portions of the Scriptures, we can see that there are only two men in the universe; the first Adam, who is the first man, and the last Adam, who is the second man. As the last Adam, the Lord is the second man, which proves that He is a man. This second man is the mingling of God and man, a second man produced through incarnation. The issue of the incarnation is that another man was produced in the universe. Formerly, there was only one man in the universe, who was out of the earth. Through the incarnation of God, the last Adam, who is also the second man, was produced. This man is out of heaven. Therefore, before the incarnation of God, there was only one man in the universe, the first Adam. When the Lord was incarnated, a second man was produced, who is also the last Adam.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:3 speaks of Christ as the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance. The Lord&rsquo;s incarnation is the shining of the glory of God and the expression of the impress of the substance of God. In the incarnation God is expressed through man. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; The issue of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation is that the last Adam, the second man, was produced and that God was expressed and declared. Matthew 1:23 says, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel (which is translated, God with us).&rdquo; Through the birth of the Lord, Emmanuel, who is God with us, came forth. This is wonderful.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
