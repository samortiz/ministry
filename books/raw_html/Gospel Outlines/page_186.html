<h1 class="title">ETERNAL REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Heb. 9:12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The need for redemption
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man is sinful before God.</li>
	<li>God is righteous and so is His law. The law has a righteous requirement because of man&rsquo;s sins.</li>
	<li>When man&rsquo;s sin confronts God&rsquo;s righteousness, there is a need for redemption.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The meaning of redemption
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Redemption resolves man&rsquo;s sins before God according to the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness.</li>
	<li>Because of God&rsquo;s righteousness, sinful men must die. So in order to redeem them, there must be another death. Only another death can satisfy the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness, and only such a death can redeem men from their sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The type of redemption
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the time of the Old Testament, before redemption was accomplished, God set up a type of redemption.</li>
	<li>Redemption was typified by the offering of goats and bulls. Goats and bulls were killed, and blood was shed to accomplish atonement for man&rsquo;s sins.</li>
	<li>The death and shed blood of goats and bulls was only a shadow, not the reality; while it made atonement for sins, it could not redeem men from their sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The accomplishment of redemption
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Redemption was accomplished on the cross. The Lord Jesus bore man&rsquo;s sins on the cross and suffered the punishment for sins. Thus He fulfilled the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness and accomplished redemption for man.</li>
	<li>The redemption of the Lord Jesus is not a symbol, but a reality. The blood of goats and bulls in the Old Testament time was only a symbol, but the redemption of Christ on the cross is a real accomplished fact.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The nature of redemption
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Redemption is eternal.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Eternal&rdquo; not only refers to time, but in nature it also denotes a completion, something accomplished once for all.</li>
	<li>So Christ&rsquo;s redemption, being eternal, is applicable and available to all men at any time.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to partake of Christ&rsquo;s redemption<br />
