   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the title of this chapter, The Redemption of the Believers Being for the Fullness of God, we are redeemed for the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fullness of God is a particular and profound phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Throughout the centuries Bible readers have argued and debated concerning this phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some versions of the Bible translate Ephesians 3:19 as, That you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This translation, however, is not according to the original text, nor is it according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The meaning of the original text is that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to be filled with the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The riches of God are the attributes of God, and God s attributes are what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has many attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, God is life, love, light, righteousness, mercy, grace, forbearance, kindness, authority, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These attributes of God are the riches of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many Christians say that they are filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a very general statement.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Testament clearly shows that to be filled with God is to be filled with the riches of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, when we are filled with God, we are filled with His life, love, light, grace, forgiveness, forbearance, power, and other riches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, we are filled with all the attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the way we become the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The ultimate meaning of fullness is expression.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We first have God s riches, and then we become God s fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s fullness is the overflow of His riches from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When God s riches overflow from within us, we become His fullness; we become the expression of God.</S>
