<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Second Proof</H2><P>First Corinthians 15:51-52 says, "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed."</P><P>First Thessalonians 4:16-17 says, "Because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord."</P><P>Each of these two passages of the Bible has its own emphasis. First Thessalonians 4 emphasizes the rapture and resurrection, whereas 1 Corinthians 15 emphasizes resurrection and transfiguration. First Corinthians 15 does not explicitly mention the rapture. However, everyone admits that both 1 Corinthians 15 and 1 Thessalonians 4 will take place at the same time. Not only do all the Bible readers admit this, but I myself acknowledge this also. This being the case, let us see if there is any clue concerning the timing of the rapture in these two passages. Yes, there is. "The trumpet of God" is a good clue. There are many trumpets of God. Of these trumpets which is the last trumpet? At what time does it sound?</P><P>The "last" trumpet in 1 Corinthians 15 can also be translated as the "ending" trumpet. First Corinthians 15 tells us that the trumpet mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4 is the last trumpet. Therefore, we have a very clear clue regarding the timing of the rapture of the Christians. First Corinthians 15 says, "At the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound." When does the last trumpet sound? Our friends say that the last trumpet sounds before the tribulation, because 1 Corinthians says that the church will be raptured at the sounding of the last trumpet. Since they advocate that the whole church will be raptured before the great tribulation, they have to conclude that the last trumpet will be sounded before the great tribulation. However, no matter how one studies the Bible, forwards or backwards, one can never find a proof for this kind of saying. They say this just because they want to say it.</P><P>The Bible never says that the last trumpet sounds before the great tribulation; on the contrary, there is a clue which shows us that it sounds after the great tribulation. The book of Revelation speaks of three sevens in regard to the tribulation: seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. Revelation says that at the time of the great tribulation seven trumpets will be sounded. According to our friends, the last trumpet will have been sounded before the great tribulation. How can seven more trumpets be sounded? This is like someone saying, "This is my last dollar, but I still have seven more dollars in my pocket." Does it sound logical? Does it make any sense?</P><P>What kind of trumpet is this last trumpet? According to the Bible, the most natural and fair conclusion is that it corresponds to the seventh trumpet in Revelation. I believe that every fair reader would admit this. Our friends would say that perhaps this last trumpet is not the seventh trumpet because the seventh trumpet is sounded during the great tribulation. They say that this last trumpet is the last trumpet of the church. Then I would ask, when did the church sound its first trumpet? Did the church ever sound a first trumpet? I have read through the New Testament a number of times, and I have never seen any trumpet of the church. There is not a first trumpet, so how could there be a last trumpet?</P><P>There was a brother who admitted the deficiency of this kind of interpretation. He said that at the time of the Roman Empire, troops started marching at the sound of the last trumpet. Can we then say that the last trumpet here is the last trumpet for the Roman troops? The Bible says that it is the trumpet of God, not the trumpet of Rome. If we are going to say that it is the trumpet of Rome, then can we not say that it is the trumpet of China? First Corinthians 15, which says the last trumpet, is parallel to 1 Thessalonians 4, which says the trumpet of God. It is clearly not the trumpet of Rome; even the more, it is not the trumpet of China. Regarding this trumpet, they have two interpretations: the trumpet of the church and the trumpet of Rome. However, 1 Thessalonians 4 says that it is neither the trumpet of the church, nor the trumpet of Rome, but the trumpet of God. Only Revelation has the trumpet of God.</P><P>Now let us see whether or not this last trumpet matches the seventh trumpet in Revelation. If they do not match, we will have nothing to say. But if they do, then we have to admit that they are the same thing.</P><P>Revelation 10:7 says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, then the mystery of God is finished, as He has announced the good news to His own slaves the prophets." This verse tells us one thing. When the seventh angel sounds the trumpet, the mystery of God is finished. We would like to ask one question. What is the mystery of God?</P>
