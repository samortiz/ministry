   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX ENJOYING CHRIST BY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REPUDIATING THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past, we have constantly emphasized the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Philippians, however, shows the importance of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As human beings, we are not a spirit or a body, but a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we Christians must be one not only in spirit, but also in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is very easy to be one in spirit; however, it is difficult to be one in soul, for in the soul we have the troublesome mind, the perplexing emotion, and the stubborn will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the book of Philippians Paul charges us to be one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The oneness in the soul is the perfect oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The oneness in the spirit, on the contrary, is temporary; it cannot last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we pray, sing, and praise the Lord, we are one in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But after we have finished praising, we may find that we are not one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The oneness in the soul is long-lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This oneness is found only in Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The book of Philippians covers the matter of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This book is unique and contains a number of new and even peculiar expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The enjoyment of Christ is in the fellowship in the gospel, in the thinking the one thing, in having the same love, and in the oneness of soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are some of the unusual terms found in the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>TWO SYMBOLS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another unusual term is found in chapter three, verse 2, where Paul says, "Beware of dogs."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Bible, a dog is an unclean animal because it does not chew the cud Lev 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for an animal to be clean, it must chew the cud like a cow or sheep, and it must also have a divided hoof.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The hoofs of horses and donkeys are not divided; therefore, these animals are not clean.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But cows and sheep are cloven-footed; hence they are clean.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Pigs have a divided hoof, but they do not chew the cud.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But dogs neither chew the cud nor are cloven-footed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both chewing the cud and a divided hoof are symbols in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A divided hoof signifies discernment in walking, discernment regarding what we should do, where we should go, and the way we should take.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have a divided hoof, we shall know whether to go to the meeting hall or to the movie theater.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But one without a cloven hoof has no discernment regarding his walk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not have the faculty of discernment, we shall become dirty, unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To chew the cud is to masticate the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We read the Bible in the way of chewing the cud.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, by prayreading the words of John 3:16, we chew the cud.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would chew the words of the Bible, how clean we would become!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we chew the cud and have divided hoofs, we shall be kept from anything defiling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we chew the cud and have cloven feet, we are no longer dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we are little lambs.</S>
