   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO SPECIAL NAME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to see how a group of Christians becomes a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most striking feature of all denominations is their special names.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every denomination has a particular name, such as the Church of Christ, the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, or the Lutheran Church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once a group assumes a special name, it has become a denomination, for taking such a designation separates that group from all other groups.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At this point I need to say strongly that the term local church is not a name.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not have a name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When people ask you what kind of church we are, you should simply say, "We are just the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To ask me what kind of church we are is like asking what kind of moon we are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The moon is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the moon is in London, it is called the moon in London.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the moon appears over Cleveland, it is called the moon in Cleveland.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same way, we say that we are the church in Cleveland or the church in Los Angeles."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But such terms are not a name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, they are a description of a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, we should never use the term the local church in a way that others might regard it as a name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The local church denotes the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not have a sectarian church or a so-called universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The churches in the Lord's recovery are churches in localities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason they are referred to as local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the words "the local church" are not a name, and we are not a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not use these terms as if they were a name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At most we should say, "We are the church in Cleveland.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church in Cleveland, of course, includes all the believers in Cleveland.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, because most Christians in Cleveland will not be recovered back to the proper ground of the church, we are the only ones still remaining as the church in Cleveland.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we do not have a special name."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>NO SPECIAL TEACHING OR PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every denomination also has a special teaching or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, the Southern Baptists practice baptism by immersion and insist that you be baptized by them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are not willing to be immersed by them, they will not accept you as a member.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For them, the receiving of the believers is not based upon the faith, but based upon the baptism they practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, certain Pentecostal groups will not receive those believers who do not speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, their kind of so-called church is built upon the ground of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Speaking in tongues is their special practice and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This special practice constitutes them a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regarding baptism, the Church of Christ is even stronger than the Southern Baptists.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They claim that if you are not immersed by them, you are not even saved and thus cannot be accepted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In like manner, if you would join the Seventh-day Adventists, you must agree to keep the Sabbath day and to tithe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Otherwise, you will not be accepted as a member.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This particular practice constitutes them a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today there are a great many independent groups.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nearly every group has particular terms as a requirement for being accepted into that group.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although some would not say this, they hold such a particular term in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, when you desire to become a member, they will reveal the terms for being received by them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They may say, "It is very good that you want to join us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in order to be a member of this group, you must agree to this teaching or practice."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Any group like this is a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are no such terms for being accepted into the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The only condition is that we believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as you have been saved through faith, you have already been received.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church receives the saints whom God has received without imposing on them any particular terms.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved, you are a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A saint is a saved one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as you have been saved, justified, redeemed, and regenerated, you are a saint, a holy one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because you are a saint already, the church receives you without requiring any special conditions or terms.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You were accepted by the church when you believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to be careful of the independent groups that are imitating the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These groups claim that they have no special terms for receiving the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if you examine these groups carefully, you will find some hidden conditions for being accepted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But we in the churches can testify that we have no particular terms whatever for acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some may ask whether calling on the name of the Lord is a term.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No, it is not a condition of being accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you enjoy calling on the name of the Lord, then call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if you do not like it, then do not call.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As long as you believe in the Lord Jesus, you are a saint, and we receive you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Others may claim that pray-reading is a term for being accepted into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No, pray-reading is not necessary for salvation, and thus it is not a condition of acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I repeat, the churches have no special terms.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Any group that has a special condition, either a special teaching or practice, for the receiving of the saints, is a sect.</S>
