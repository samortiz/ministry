        <h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>In eternity future the old creation will pass away, and all things will be made new (Rev. 21:5). There will be no shadow of the old creation; everything will become new&mdash;a new universe with a new heaven and a new earth. On the new earth there will be nations, and the New Jerusalem will be in their midst (v. 24). The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the New Jerusalem (22:1). God in Christ will rule in eternity with the New Jerusalem as the center.</p>
<p>Orthodox expositors of the Bible acknowledge that the New Jerusalem is a city with symbolic significance. The New Jerusalem is &ldquo;the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God&rdquo; (Heb. 11:10, 16), a city that has been prepared for His redeemed as their eternal dwelling place and His habitation (12:22; Gal. 4:26). The city lies square and is pure gold, like clear glass, and the building work of its wall is jasper (Rev. 21:16, 18). The foundations of its wall are adorned with twelve precious stones, and on the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles (vv. 19-20, 14). The city has twelve gates: three on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west, and on the gates are inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel (vv. 12-13). Each gate is of one pearl (v. 21). In the city there is only one street of pure gold, like transparent glass (v. 21). This street is a spiral and leads from the twelve gates to the throne of God and of the Lamb at the center of the city. In the middle of the street the river of water of life proceeds out from the throne of God and flows spirally with the street. On either side of the river there is the tree of life that grows and yields fruit each month (22:1-2). God and Christ are the temple. This means that our place of worship is the presence of God and Christ. The city does not need the shining of the sun or of the moon, and there is no night there, for the glory of God illumines it, and its lamp is the Lamb (21:22-23, 25). Only those whose names are written in the book of life may enter into the city to enjoy the fruit of the tree of life and the water of the river of life (v. 27). These are those who have been redeemed throughout the generations. On the one hand, they are priests serving God, and on the other hand, they are kings ruling the surrounding nations (20:6; 22:3, 5). How blessed is such a glorious city!</p>
<p>According to its symbolic significance, the New Jerusalem is composed of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people throughout the generations. These redeemed ones include those in the Old Testament, signified by the names of the twelve tribes on the twelve gates, and those in the New Testament, signified by the names of the twelve apostles on the foundations of its wall (21:12, 14). The New Jerusalem is a glorious city constituted of glorious people. Hence, she can be the counterpart of Christ and the bride, the wife, of Christ (vv. 2, 9). The New Jerusalem is a building that is the issue of God&rsquo;s redemptive work throughout the generations. The materials that God uses for this building are Christ&rsquo;s life, which has passed through death and resurrection as signified by the pearls; God&rsquo;s nature, as signified by the gold; and God&rsquo;s glory, as signified by the precious stones. Pearls are produced from the wounds of an oyster. This signifies that the city is produced by the life of Christ, which passed through death and resurrection. This is our entrance. In the Bible gold signifies God&rsquo;s nature; this is our content. Everything of this city, including the street, is transparent, pure gold, indicating that everything of the New Jerusalem is related to God&rsquo;s nature and is transparent. Precious stones signify the appearance of God (cf. 4:3; Dan. 10:6; Exo. 24:10).</p>
<p>The city is of pure gold and the foundations of the wall are precious stones (Rev. 21:18-20). This means that the city is constituted with God&rsquo;s nature, and it expresses God&rsquo;s image. God&rsquo;s appearance is like a jasper stone (4:3), the wall of the city is built with jasper, and the light that shines forth from the city is also like jasper (21:18, 11). This indicates that the city bears the image of God; the light that shines forth from the city is the light of God&rsquo;s image. The city is the issue of the divine life that has been released and imparted through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection; it is filled with God&rsquo;s nature, and it bears God&rsquo;s glorious image to express the effulgence of His glory. The presence of God and Christ, the throne of God and of the Lamb, the worship and service to God and Christ, and the reigning of God and Christ are all related to the city. The city is filled with God, Christ, and light, and out of the throne of God and of the Lamb life flows forth for supply and enjoyment.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
