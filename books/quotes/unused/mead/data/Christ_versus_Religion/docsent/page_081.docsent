   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEACHING OF JEZEBEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we come to the church at Thyatira we meet an even worse situation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Following the second step, you will surely have the third.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, in Thyatira we see a woman called Jezebel, a woman who has gathered many teachings and calls herself a prophetess.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus far we have seen the doctrine of Balaam, the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, and now the teaching of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why we say that we must drop the teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thyatira, according to church history, typifies the Roman Catholic Church, and that false church is called by the Spirit here that evil woman Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was she who brought so many pagan teachings and practices into the church and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The result then was idol worship and fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are three abominations in the eyes of the Lord idol worship, fornication, and division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Idol worship is an insult to the person of God; fornication is a damage to humanity; and division is a mutilation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God cares for Himself, God cares for humanity, and God cares for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God would never tolerate any idols, any fornication, or any division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here in the church at Thyatira, the woman Jezebel brought in her evil doctrine and caused much idol worship and fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's divine being was insulted, and the proper humanity was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the Roman Catholic religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is dreadful to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This woman by the name of Jezebel, after being fully developed, becomes the great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter 2 of Revelation her name is Jezebel, and in chapter 17 her name is Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She is also called the great harlot and the mother of the harlots of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the ultimate development of the Christian religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Step by step was taken; one step led to another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first step was a superabundance of labor; the second step was the doctrine of Balaam and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans; then the third step opened the door widely to paganism and led directly to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Babylon is the consummation of Christian religion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How desperate we must be to avoid anything religious!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not say that there is nothing wrong with doing missionary work, with organizing a mission and spreading the Gospel for the furtherance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That might be the first step towards the forming of a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you take the first step, you will take the second and then eventually the third until you topple headlong into Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we are in the age of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My burden concerning the matter of Christ versus religion is very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I fear that perhaps ten or fifteen years from now history will be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may soon be taking the first step in an overabundance of work and labor, losing our personal and intimate love for the Lord Jesus in the first and best way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we will be on our way to form some kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will soon be taking all the doctrines and going the full course in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since we are in the Lord's recovery, we must be clear: we must have nothing to do with the first step, the second or the third step; we must be on the alert not to have anything religious.</S>
