   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN BEING BALANCED IN THE WORD AND PRAYER Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:15; 2:2; Col 3:16; 4:16; Psa 119:147-148</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The verses in the Scripture Reading above show us how to deal with the word in a balanced way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 119:147 speaks of rising in the morning, saying, "I anticipated the dawn and cried out; / I hoped in Your words."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Simpler translations, such as the New American Standard Version, render the first phrase as, "I rise before dawn."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE NEED TO BE BALANCED</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are two kinds of reactions to the message in the previous chapter concerning reading the Lord's word by exercising our spirit to take it as food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because there are at least two categories of people among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One reaction is to say, "Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a release from burden and bondage."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another reaction, however, is to be bothered by that message.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who are bothered may not say anything, but their mentality is turning, and they ask, "Is there no need to know the word?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is there no need to understand the Scriptures?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I sympathize with both kinds of brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consider how many ears we have.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have two ears, one on each of the two sides of our head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is one bigger and the other smaller?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No, they are of equal size.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, we have two eyes of equal size and two nostrils of the same size.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also have two shoulders, two arms, and two hands, each on two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are all balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We stand solidly and strongly because we have two legs and two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we were made with one leg and one foot, we could not stand for long and we would be shakable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not shakable, though, because we are balanced on two legs, not one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can apply this principle to almost all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In almost everything in the universe there is the principle of two for balance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In contacting the Lord by reading the word and by prayer there is also the balance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some say that the morning is the best time to come to the word and pray, while some say that the evening is better.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this also there is a balance; we need the evening to balance the morning and the morning to balance the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the previous message I stressed that we should not exercise the mind but exercise the spirit to pray about what we understand in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I did this because people in Christianity have gone too far in one direction in an unbalanced way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is why we must first do our best to bring people back.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many brothers and sisters have gone too far in one direction in dealing with the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Christianity many are careless about the word of God, so they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A small number of Christians, however, care for the word so much that they are unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In their Bibles there are many notes and marks in different colors.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I too have a number of Bibles like this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In a sense this is good, but in another sense it is not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many have been spoiled by coming to the Bible in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hosea 7:8 says, "Ephraim is a cake / Not turned."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The sisters who cook know they must turn a cake.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To cook the cake is good, but too much cooking on one side spoils it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some younger believers are proud of the marks and notes in their Bible and are willing to show them off.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those notes, however, simply show that they are cooked too much on one side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They exercise their mind too much in reading and understanding the word, and that spoils them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Cooking is necessary, but it must be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Too much on one side spoils the cake.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Have you realized that you may be cooked too much on one side?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may read much, but you do not pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You know the word so much, but you do not pray much about the word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may read the word, understand it, study it, and search, even research, it much by exercising your mind, but you may not pray much by exercising your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, you are unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is too much cooking on one side with respect to the word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some Christians give up the Bible and leave it on the shelf.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They do not touch it or even bring it to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are unbalanced in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bibles of certain persons, however, especially of those who have a background of one-sided cooking, may have many notes and marks.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They think, consider, and meditate on the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are unbalanced in another way, and they may need to exchange their Bible for a new, clean one with no notes and marks.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I say again, to cook a cake is not only right but necessary, but to cook it too much on one side is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a "cake not turned."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How many hours have we spent in reading, studying, searching, and researching the word?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And how many hours have we spent in prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If in our Christian life we have spent ten thousand hours in reading, studying, searching, and researching the word but only one hundred hours in prayer, we are in debt.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have a credit on one side and a debit on the other side, and the balance is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If someone would say that he has spent ten thousand hours for reading and eleven thousand hours for prayer, I would praise the Lord for that.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a small imbalance, but it is a credit, not a debit, of only one thousand hours.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some brothers, though, have no desire, no burden, and no "bondage."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are one hundred percent "released" and "free."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They have a blank account with no credit and no debit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They say that it is too much to carry both a Bible and a hymnal, but they themselves carry neither a Bible nor a hymnal.</S>
