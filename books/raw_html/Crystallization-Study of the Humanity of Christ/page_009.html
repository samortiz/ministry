<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ, Who Was God, Wrestling as a Man<br>in His Humanity with Jacob</H2><P>Genesis 32 reveals that Christ, who was God, wrestled as a man in His humanity with Jacob. This was during the time that Jacob was under the threatening that his elder brother Esau would come to destroy him on his way back to his father's land from Haran, where he could not suffer his uncle Laban's stripping any longer. At that time Christ came in His humanity to meet Jacob at the time of his need (vv. 1-24). Jacob probably realized that this man was God, so he would not let Him go unless He blessed him (v. 26). If God had remained only in His divinity, there would have been no possibility for a man to deal with God in this way. Jacob was so strong that he would not let God go. Realizing that He could not prevail against Jacob, Christ as God touched the hollow of his thigh so that the hollow of his thigh was out of joint (v. 25). From that day Jacob became a lame man.</P><P>His touching of the hollow of Jacob's thigh transformed Jacob, a heel-holder, into Israel, the prince of God, for the carrying out of God's economy (v. 28). Jacob wanted to be the first out of his mother's womb, so he grasped Esau's heel. He did not want Esau to be ahead of him. But the Lord transformed him into the prince of God, the meaning of the name Israel. Christ came to visit Abraham as a man in His humanity for the purpose of carrying out God's economy. Later Christ wrestled with Jacob as a man in His humanity in order that Jacob would become Israel, who is one of the three prominent forefathers of the people of Israel for the carrying out of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ, as a Man in His Humanity,<br>Meeting Joshua</H2><P>Christ, as a man in His humanity, met Joshua as the Captain of Jehovah's army to fight for Israel for the carrying out of God's economy (Josh. 5:13-15). Joshua was neither like Abraham, a common man, nor like Jacob, a cunning person. Joshua was a general, the commander of God's army, fighting not only for Israel but also for the carrying out of God's eternal economy.</P>
