   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Here we would say a little word about the practical way of entering into fellowship:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Firstly, we must know that the feeling of the anointing is the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we desire to enter into the fellowship of life, or, in other words, to enter into the anointing, we must first understand the teaching derived from the feeling of the anointing which is moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Secondly, we must cease all outward activities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our whole being should cease from all outward activity and movement in order to turn within and give full attention to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are busy with outward activities, it is impossible for us to take care of the inner feeling of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The previous point is to know the feeling, whereas this point is to take heed of the feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All Christian work and activities which are of any spiritual value should come from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, we should have an inward incentive and guidance, then work and act according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But many Christians until this day are constantly living in outward activities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being zealous for the Lord, they carry their Bibles and run to meet the outward need while neglecting the feeling within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not know the feeling within them, neither do they pay attention to this inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Consequently, these people have no way to enter into fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, if we desire to enter into fellowship, we must cease from all outward activities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thirdly, we must have a fixed time to practice this fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The beginner, learning how to fellowship with the Lord, should set aside several fixed times each day to practice this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At this time, do not try to bring in many items of prayer we should even cease from praying outward prayers , but pray according to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During this kind of prayer, we sense mostly our sins and offenses and deal with them accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, we feel mostly that we have to turn to the Lord and consecrate ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then spontaneously we look to the grace of the Lord; through His supply of grace we enter into deeper fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Finally, thanksgiving, praise, and worship follow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we practice this fellowship daily at these set times, our spirit will be strong and living, making it easier to touch the Lord and enter into His fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fourthly, we must practice fellowship with the Lord at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we spend quite a period of time in practicing fellowship at specific times, we should practice fellowship with the Lord at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Appointed times of fellowship are possible by laying aside all outward activities and by praying and seeking wholeheartedly after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is comparatively easy for us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, continual fellowship should be maintained during the whole day, whether at work or at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may be very busy outwardly or occupied with many business affairs, yet inwardly we are always with the Lord, experiencing constantly and naturally the anointing in His presence so that we can continuously live in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This point is higher and more difficult to attain, but is possible through continuous practice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. Obeying the Teaching of the Anointing and Living in the Presence of God</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To obey the teaching of the anointing means to walk according to the spirit, live in fellowship, and live in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, walking according to the spirit is related to the Holy Spirit, living in fellowship is related to the Lord, and living in the presence of God is related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, these three are a relationship between the teaching of the anointing and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As for the Holy Spirit, He anoints and moves within our spirit; hence, we need to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As for the Lord, He lives within us and becomes our life that we may have the flow of life; hence, we need to live in fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As for God, He is in us to impart the light of His face that we may enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we need to live before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may obtain all three of these aspects by obeying the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the truth, God has ever been with us since the day we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His presence has never departed from us, and we can never lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This presence is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Holy Spirit within us is God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, this presence is not a condition or a matter, but a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This Person is the Holy Spirit, whose being in us is the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the day we are saved, this presence is never lost.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, according to our experience, we are not always conscious of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes, it seems that His presence has disappeared and we have lost the light of His face.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It all depends upon the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without the anointing, the presence of God cannot be made real within us, and we cannot feel the light from His face.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With the anointing, the reality of His presence and the sense of the light from His face follow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, by the anointing we can experience the presence of God in a practical way.</S>
