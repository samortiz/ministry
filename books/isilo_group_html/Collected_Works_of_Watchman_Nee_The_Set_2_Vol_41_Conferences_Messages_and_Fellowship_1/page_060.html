All dead rules are set aside, and one seeks after God's will directly. After my servant finished cleaning the floor, he did not know what to do next. When twelve o'clock came, he did not know if I wanted to eat. This is the way one lives when he is in the Spirit. He moves when he has the revelation of the Spirit and waits on the Lord otherwise. How do we know if a person is saved and ready for baptism? We can quiz him about the truth concerning salvation and baptism, and he may answer everything correctly. If we then say that he is eligible for baptism, we are acting according to the law. Suppose there is an old lady from the countryside who cannot read or say any of the biblical terms. She cannot answer any question concerning regeneration, repentance, or forgiveness. Yet she has the peace in her heart. Should we baptize her? The issue is not whether the candidate for baptism will pass our test and answer our questions. The issue is whether or not she is regenerated. Many village folks do not know any terminology, yet they have peace and joy inwardly. Such ones may not understand anything in their mind, but they are genuinely saved.</p><p>At our Lord's table meeting in Shanghai, we often have visitors joining us unannounced. How long should we ask them to wait before we invite them to break bread with us? Should they wait a week or a month? Actually, if we know that a person is saved, we can invite him to break bread with us immediately. There is no need to wait.</p><p>The co-workers must never lay down any laws. We have to allow the Holy Spirit to operate and work within each person separately. Everything in the Bible is living, but it is living only when it is in the Spirit. If we make a thing an ordinance, it immediately becomes dead. The truth of the Bible must be realized in the Spirit; only then will it be living. In conducting conferences, we sometimes receive a message from the Lord and speak it. This may result in the salvation of many people. However, the next time we conduct another conference, we may think that we should do the same since so many were saved last time. We may then proceed to deliver the same message, and to our surprise no one is saved. We think that if a message saves people one time, it will save people all the time. But the result is not what we expect. A message saves people when it is delivered in the Spirit. The same message repeated according to the law will not save anyone. Here lies the difference between walking according to the Spirit and walking according to the law.</p><p>Everything that is not done according to the living guidance of the Spirit is a kind of law. We often take yesterday's leading as today's guidance. But applying yesterday's guidance to today is to walk according to the law. We should not think that just because the Spirit was leading us a certain way in the past that He will lead us the same way today. Imitating the leading of yesterday is being in the law. It is even possible to walk according to the law in obeying the biblical truth. If we want to be baptized just because the Bible says so rather than as a result of the leading of the Spirit within, we are following the law. We must walk according to the Scripture, but our leading is only proper when this walk is confirmed by the inner guidance. If anyone says that something is right because the Bible has never said that it is wrong, he is completely in the realm of the law. Many people write to me to ask if this or that is right. I write back and ask whether they have the Holy Spirit within. If they do, they should learn to follow the inner guidance of the Holy Spirit. I am not a fortune-teller or a diviner; I cannot know God's will for you. You have to learn to know the inner guidance of the Spirit yourself.</p><p>In learning to follow the guidance of the Spirit, we have to ask what the Spirit is saying before we ask what the Bible is saying. The first thing we should ask is what the inner registration is telling us. However, most people today first ask what the Bible says and do not ask what the Spirit within says. This is not normal. A New Testament believer has the Holy Spirit residing within. This is a precious thing. We have to learn to know the inner leading of the Holy Spirit within us. There is a difference between the principles and commandments in the Bible. A believer must not only obey the commandments in the Bible, but also walk according to the principles that are behind the commandments. Consider the matter of the head covering. If you cover your head merely because 1 Corinthians 11 says so, you have not covered your head in reality. Unless a man obeys the Bible according to the leading of the Spirit, his obedience is the same as his disobedience. The main thing is what the Lord is saying within a person. If the Lord is leading you to obey a certain truth in the Bible, and you act accordingly, this is true obedience to God.</p><p>In the Old Testament there was the dispensation of the law, but today we are in the New Testament dispensation. Yet there are still too many "Jews" in the church today. They keep the law and make the Bible a book of laws. Many people ask others what they think of this or that. This means that they do not know how to ask the Spirit within them. This is not normal.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT<br />BEING CONFIRMED BY THE BIBLE</h2><p>Every sheep knows its shepherd's voice. Many people think that if they do not know the letter of the Bible, they will not know how to live. Does this mean that they will sin every day? In actuality, if we follow the leading of the Spirit, we will experience just the opposite. It is much better to follow the leading of the Spirit than to follow the Bible alone. We can forget, but the Holy Spirit will not forget. We may ask, "If the work of the Holy Spirit is so crucial, does this mean that we do not need the Bible anymore?" Theoretically, the leading of the Holy Spirit within is good enough, but in following this inner leading, it is possible for us to make mistakes. Therefore, we still need the Bible. In other words, we are not following the leading of the Bible; we are following the leading of the Spirit within. However, we are checking this daily inner leading with the Bible. Only when we obey both the inner leading and the outward leading are we truly obeying God. We cannot obey only the teaching of the Bible. We must follow the leading of the Spirit within and then compare it with the Bible. If the leading cannot be confirmed by the Bible, it is not a leading from the Spirit but a work of the emotion. The real issue is the inward registration.</p><p>In Chefoo two people asked me if they should leave the denominations. I answered, "I do not know." They said, "Does this mean that you are opposed to us leaving the denominations?" Then I asked them, "How does the life in you feel when you are in the denominations? Do you feel that the life within is blossoming when you stay in the denominations? If you feel that way, you should stay in the denominations. If not, you should leave." It is absolutely not a question of right or wrong but a question of life.</p><p>There was a famous Western missionary in Chefoo who came three times to discuss the question of sects with me. The first two times I avoided her and did not talk with her about the subject. The last time she came she insisted on talking about it. I felt that there was the leading of the Spirit, and I talked with her for five minutes. After our talk we sat down for tea. I told her that I was in a big circle, but that she was in a small circle within the big circle. After our talk, I escorted her out. Two days later, she came to me early in the morning and said, "Last night I sent out three letters of resignation." I told her, "You should not be influenced by me. Such a matter can only be decided by God alone. Only God can call you out of a denomination." She said, "I inquired of God last night and saw that the small circle within the big circle is man's choice and that man's choice is a sin. I felt that it is God's will that I should leave my denomination. That is why I got up last night and wrote the letters of resignation." I shook her hand. From that point on, she began to go on positively in the way of the Lord and was not bothered by any negative element.</p><p>As workers for the Lord we should be careful not to lead others merely according to the Bible. We should allow the Holy Spirit to personally guide them from within. We do not need to make all the saints identical according to some outward standards or to maintain some outward order. If we do this, the Holy Spirit will not have the ground or the freedom to work. We must not be a Moses, dispensing letters and the law to others. Our law is just the Holy Spirit. He is our absolute guidance. We have to learn to follow the guidance of the Spirit within. If a man keeps the law, he can go on without God. But if a man lives by the Spirit, he will not be able to leave God for a moment. Once he leaves God, he will die.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
