<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>BEING A LIVING WITNESS OF THE LORD</h1><h2 class=head1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY IN TAIWAN</h2><p>The center, the focus, of the Lord’s leading to us on the island of Taiwan is to gospelize Taiwan. This is not a small thing in the history of Christianity. It has been more than a hundred years since the Presbyterian Church of Scotland brought the gospel to Taiwan in the nineteenth century. According to the statistics of last year, this group, which has a membership of around 120,000, has the greatest number of Christians in Taiwan. The churches in the Lord’s recovery have been in Taiwan for only thirty years. We have forty to fifty thousand people and are in second place. The total number of Christians in Taiwan is less than 500,000. Compared with Taiwan’s population of 20,000,000, only 2.5% are Christians. This figure is too low, too small, and too poor.<p>According to my feeling, this is a great shame. After the Lord sent us to Taiwan, by His mercy and grace there was great blessing on our work in the first few years, and within five to six years there was a hundred percent increase and multiplication. In 1949 the number of saints in the Lord’s recovery in Taiwan was only about 400. By 1955, however, the number had increased to about 50,000. If we had continued to increase at that rate, Taiwan would have been gospelized a long time ago.<p>However, at that time, because we went astray slightly by turning our attention to so-called spirituality, it brought in disaster. We invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks, who was renowned for his spirituality at the time, to help us pursue spiritual knowledge. His visit brought in different opinions and led to incidents of dissension among us. From that time on, we lost our one accord and our morale for active propagation. Because of this, our increase was also halted. Affected by this event, I lost the heart to lead the work in Taiwan, so I went to America to have a new start.<p>When I first arrived in America, my feeling toward that country was pleasant and sweet. Those who are familiar with the history of the Lord’s recovery know that although the rate of increase in America in the beginning was not as high as that in Taiwan, it was still quite high. Consider the situation at that time. Since the churches in Taiwan were hesitating, I went to America alone, without any helper or financial support. They were more or less “sitting on the fence,” waiting to see whether my ministry was right or whether Brother Austin-Sparks’s ministry was right. In that hesitating situation, about eighty percent leaned toward my side, while at least twenty percent leaned toward the other side. I did not do anything about that wait-and-see attitude, except to let things run their course. I just devoted myself to the work in America.<p>After twenty-two years of endeavoring, not only has there been an increase, but there has also been propagation. As a result, one hundred churches were raised up in North America, and more than one hundred churches were also raised up in Central and South America. In addition, more than one hundred churches were founded in Europe, Africa, and Australia. Hence, the Lord’s recovery quickly spread to the four big continents outside of Asia, and more than three hundred churches were raised up. This rate of increase is very high.<p>Today many elderly saints who are here must be held accountable for having a wait-and-see attitude. Then in 1965, two brothers wrote me personally in all seriousness. In one of their letters they said that no one can deny that the work on the island of Taiwan was raised up by the Lord through me. They also wrote that a situation had appeared in which over eighty co-workers were willing to absolutely follow my leading to do the work; however, there were also several co-workers who seemingly were taking the way of the church and standing on the ground of the church but were actually doing a work of tearing down. Thus, according to their feeling, if these ones were allowed to continue their work among us, all the other co-workers would have no way to go on.<p>When I received the letter in May that year, I was clear within that the brothers’ attitude was the following: since I was the one who built up the work, I had to be the one to clear up the situation, or else they would have no way to go on. At that time I had already promised to visit Brazil. In addition, in the summer there would be the usual big conference for the entire United States followed by the move for propagation. So I replied to the brothers, telling them that I had to wait until September to go back to Taiwan.<p>In my letter I also told them that previously when I returned to Taiwan, I usually held a general conference first and then met with the co-workers. This time, however, I would meet with all the co-workers of the whole province of Taiwan on the day after my arrival. The first thing I would do would be to make an announcement asking all the dissenting ones to leave the work. I would not “quarantine” them because they had not committed any sin which would require their being separated from the church, but since they had violated the principle of the work, they would not be allowed to participate in the work any longer. Therefore, I would ask them to remove themselves from this work. After receiving my letter and upon knowing that I would shoulder the responsibility, the two brothers were comforted in their hearts.<p>Eventually, when I attended this co-workers’ meeting I opened up right away and said, “In my coming back this time the first thing I will deal with is the dissension brought in through the visit of Brother Austin-Sparks. At the time that the dissension was brought in, I warned the dissenting ones, both privately through some serious conversations and exhortations and publicly in big meetings, telling them that if they intended to stay in this work, they would have to keep the one accord. If they do not want to stay in this work, they could go out to do their own work according to their inner feeling. We all must be gentlemen, sons of God, and sons of light. We should not remain here to do anything that is against our conscience as Christians. However, in these few years, you, the dissenting ones, are still in pretense, even to such an extent that these eighty co-workers are not able to carry out the work. So I ask you, all the dissenting ones, to leave this work.” In this way I dealt with the situation.
