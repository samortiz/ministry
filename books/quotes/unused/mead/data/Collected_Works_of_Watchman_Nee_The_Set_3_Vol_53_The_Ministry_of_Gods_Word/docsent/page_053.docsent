   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO DIFFERENT REALMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must realize that there are two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One realm is the realm of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this realm a man only needs to convey to others what he has learned from school, books, and Bible expositors.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All it takes is some work, cleverness, and eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The other realm is the realm of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this realm a man can do nothing unless he has God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must see that in the ministry of God's word, man is powerless and helpless apart from God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God does not speak, we cannot force any word out of our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God does not give us His revelation, we do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God gives us revelation, we have the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God does not give us revelation, we have no ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The exercise of our ministry is based upon corresponding revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to be linked up to God in this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not come to the Lord, we cannot stand before men and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the other realm we can use what we have memorized, learned, or spoken from the previous month or week.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In that realm, man can do something; he can resort to his own ways.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All he needs is memory, cleverness, and eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the realm of revelation, no one can be a minister of the word unless God does the work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All who have learned this lesson before the Lord can discern this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everywhere they go, they can tell which realm a person is in when he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some brothers commit the fundamental blunder of regarding eloquence and intelligence as qualifications for a good message.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They think that preaching is one hundred percent a matter of eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Bible shows us that preaching does not depend on eloquence but on receiving revelation from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Preaching that contains no revelation merely nourishes man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It can stimulate man's thoughts, but it cannot provide revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This should be our concern: Unless we first have the basic revelation, we cannot have many subsequent revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who do not have the basic revelation do not have subsequent revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if they teach many doctrines, they cannot convey revelation to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who are in one realm can only produce fruits from that realm.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A listener with a good memory may retain a message for a few days, but after that time, the message goes away and nothing remains.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man can listen to our messages, but our word does not result in any condemnation of evil, the flesh, or the carnal man in him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Words from one realm can only produce fruits from that realm; they do not produce fruits from a different realm.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fruits of the outward realm consist of nothing but a collection of words, doctrines, and expositions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sermons that are propagated in this realm consist of nothing but the fruits of this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the other realm is different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a person has received revelation once and is continually receiving revelations, he imparts revelation to others as he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only revelation produces revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only light produces light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only God's word results in the work of the Holy Spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Knowledge begets only knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Doctrine begets only doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the same way revelation begets only revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not enough for us to give doctrines to others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Neither is it enough for us to give old revelations to others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What are doctrines?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Doctrines are past revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The words in the Bible were once living, but they are not necessarily living for everyone today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the words that the Holy Spirit has reiterated are living to man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When many people read the Bible, they only touch the words of the Bible; they do not touch the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need the Holy Spirit to speak a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need the Lord to speak a second time apart from His established speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has to speak directly to a person before he can hear God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A hundred people may listen to a sermon, but only two among them may receive any help.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God may only speak to these two among the hundred; the other ninety-eight will not hear anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Unless the Holy Spirit speaks, the words of the Bible are doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to remember that all past revelations are but doctrines to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although God might have spoken to us and revealed Himself to us once through these words, the same words and revelation will be but doctrines to us without the anointing of the Holy Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They can only produce fruits of doctrine; they cannot produce fruits of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The problem today is that doctrines are passed on from generation to generation, yet there is no revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A believing father does not necessarily produce a believing son.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Holy Spirit may regenerate the first generation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He may regenerate the second generation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The third and fourth generations may turn out to be unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's Spirit may work on the fifth generation again and regenerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every regeneration is the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When a man begets a son in the flesh, his physical attributes pass on from his generation to the next generation, but there is no work of the Holy Spirit involved in this transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Regeneration involves the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once the work of the Holy Spirit is withheld, there is no regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One way conveys the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is not hard to preserve doctrines for hundreds or even thousands of years.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Doctrines produce doctrine, and the cycle continues.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A man may know nothing except doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>While he preaches doctrines, two or three thousand people may be listening to him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What is in him are doctrines, and what goes out of him are also doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These doctrines are passed on from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is like begetting children in the physical realm; one does not need the operation of the Holy Spirit to beget a son.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But the same is not true with revelation and the ministry of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The ministry of God's word requires the anointing of the Holy Spirit each time.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Holy Spirit has to operate in man in order for him to experience salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Similarly, there must be the revelation of the Holy Spirit before there can be the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As soon as the Holy Spirit stops His revelation, the word becomes nothing but doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Holy Spirit must operate before there can be the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Whenever the anointing ceases, there is no vision, no revelation, and no ministry of the word.</S>
