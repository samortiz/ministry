   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUTWARD MEMORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Next, we have to consider the outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes the Lord uses our outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At such times the outward memory becomes necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But sometimes the Lord does not want to use our outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At such times the outward memory is useless to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why is our outward memory necessary at times and useless at other times?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I cannot explain this; I can only state the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a fact for which I can give you no explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes we have the word within; we have the word of God s revelation, and we also have the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are very clear within, but we still need to exercise our own memory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit reminds us of things; He does not create a separate memory for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The memory of the Holy Spirit means that the Holy Spirit reminds us of things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 14:26 says, He will...remind you of all the things which I have said to you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s Spirit is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He gives us a revelation, this revelation is kept alive in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we speak, God may give us two words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These two words are the key words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we remember these key words, amazingly the memory of the Holy Spirit will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if we forget these two words, the memory of the Holy Spirit will also be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes when the Holy Spirit reminds us of these words, we are afraid that our memory will fail, and we write down these crucial and important words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Often as we recall these two words, the picture within comes back, and we see the revelation once again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows us that the Holy Spirit uses our outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes we jot down a few words, and just a glance at them makes us inwardly clear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet sometimes we are not clear within even after we look at the words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During these times, it is clear that the Holy Spirit is not using our outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we can say that the outward memory can be both useful and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes the Lord shows us something.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet after a while, only the outward memory is left; inwardly we do not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is nothing that we can do about this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Under normal circumstances, we should write down the words we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more revelation we receive from God, the more we need our outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The less revelation we receive from God, the less we need our outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The stronger our inward memory is before the Lord, the more our outward memory and inward memory will be purified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the things in our outward memory and inward memory become more purified, we will retain things both in our outward memory as well as in our inward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the beginning our inward memory may not match what has been retained in our outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The things we retain outwardly may sometimes be visible to us and sometimes be gone from us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But as our experience advances, we will find these two kinds of memory becoming more and more one; they will merge to become one memory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will find that, along with the outward remembrance of the words, there is also the inward remembrance of the words.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the reason that we have to humble ourselves before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to pray much, look to Him much, and be ready at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are clear about what we see, we can speak to others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must always preserve the inner words in the revelation of the Holy Spirit before we speak it out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes you may give a good message, and everyone may applaud you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But within you know how good the message really was.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the time of your speaking, you could not recall the very thing that you were impressed with.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The outward memory did not match the inward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You said the right things, but the revelation was not there; it had faded into the background.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must learn this lesson before the Lord: A minister of the word must have light, inner thoughts, the inner words, the outer words, and the memory of the Holy Spirit, as well as the outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The memory of the Holy Spirit should lie between revelation and the inner words; it should be ready always to supply the inner words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The outward memory should be placed in between the inner words and the outer words; it should be ready always to supply the outer words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let us consider these three steps: light, the inner word, and the outer words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For now we will not consider the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The memory of the Holy Spirit should lie in between the first and the second items.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our own memory should lie in between the second and the third items.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The memory of the Holy Spirit should lie between the light and the inner words so that the memory of the Holy Spirit can supply the inner words with light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The inner words have to be fed by the light of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without the feeding of the light, the inner words will die; they will become something physical, not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The memory of the Holy Spirit supplies the inner words with light so that the inner words will continue to thrive in the environment of light.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we have to use our own words, which we acquire by exercising our own memory to supply the outer words with the inner words.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When this happens we will have the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In exercising our own memory, we have to remember that the outward memory can never replace the function of the inner memory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In fact, the memory of the Holy Spirit often has no use for the outward memory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Another thing we have to realize is that sometimes the outward memory can even become a barrier to the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The outward memory is not only unqualified to substitute for the Spirit s memory, but at times it actually can frustrate the Spirit s memory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sometimes the inner word within us is shining and living, and the Holy Spirit reminds us of this shining.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet outwardly, we forget the few crucial words.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The utterance is gone, and we cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many times there is no problem inwardly; the problem lies in outside factors.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The crucial words are lost, and the speaking is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we become more experienced, we see that our memory sometimes aids the Spirit s memory, while at other times, our memory blocks the Spirit s memory.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Spirit s memory has to use our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Spirit cannot use another memory besides our own; it has to use our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Suppose we are busy with outside affairs all the time and cannot remember many words.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are either too careless or too anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even though the Lord has given us three or five words, we can forget them all and be unable to remember one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even though we cannot remember these words, nevertheless, we may speak for an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The taste, however, is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the reason that we sometimes have to write down the revelation we have in a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The few words will refresh the seeing, and the entire revelation within us will come alive again as we read these words.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Every time we serve as a minister of the word, the Holy Spirit may want to say many things.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We cannot emphasize one part while overlooking another part.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For example, the Holy Spirit may want to say three things, yet we may miss two of them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The two things that we have missed become a burden to us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As long as we miss one thing, we cannot be considered as a qualified minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Within one revelation, God may need to release more than one word or cover more than one subject.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He may want to bring up two or three subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we forget them or skip over them, we will feel the weight upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, we have to write down the three or five words.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>These three or five words can evoke more meaning than just the meaning of the words themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord may want us to mention three or five subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We should write down every one of them so that nothing is missed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we miss the last point, we barely may be able to get by with the rest of the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But if we miss the first point, the whole meeting will be ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Ministry of the word is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must never offend the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We may think that it does not matter much whether or not we speak well.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It seems as if we can afford to miss one out of five sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we miss the very thing that we are supposed to release, we will feel the weight upon us increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we miss something, we will feel its weight, because we have not communicated what God wants to convey to His children.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Consequently, our burden increases.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>A minister of the word should never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We must remember that if the Lord wants us to say three things, we have to say three things.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If the Lord wants us to say five things, we have to say five things.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we cannot release them all, our burden will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we release all the points except one, the light will be veiled, and we will feel the weight and the bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is the reason that we must learn to exercise ourselves to have a good memory before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must guard against any failure of our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>May God grant us a clear understanding of the way of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our outward memory is merely a slave to the Spirit s memory; it is merely a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>But if this servant becomes unfruitful, the Spirit s memory is not able to function well.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Our memory needs to be renewed so that it can become useful to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Every minister of the word has to pass through the proper dealings before becoming useful.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Our mind must be dealt with to the extent that it can become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Our memory also must be dealt with to the extent that it can become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The thoughts and the memory are very much related to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Once our memory fails, revelation is locked up and eventually dies.</S>
