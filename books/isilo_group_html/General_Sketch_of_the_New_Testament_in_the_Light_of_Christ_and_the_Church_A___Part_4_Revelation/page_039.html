in Three Equal Dimensions</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:16 says, &ldquo;And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.&rdquo; To interpret these symbols we need wisdom, and we need the entire Scriptures. In both the tabernacle built by Moses and the temple built by Solomon the Holy of Holies was equal in three dimensions. The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was ten cubits long, ten cubits wide, and ten cubits high (Exo. 26:2-8), while the Holy of Holies in the temple was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high (1 Kings 6:20). In the entire Scriptures only these three structures&mdash;the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament and the New Jerusalem in the New Testament&mdash;are equal in three dimensions. This indicates that the entire New Jerusalem is not only the tabernacle of God but also the Holy of Holies. In the Old Testament tabernacle there were two sections, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, but in the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God there is only one section. This means that the veil between the two sections is gone.</p>
<p>That the dimensions of the New Jerusalem are equal in three directions indicates that it is perfect and complete in every way, absolutely straight, and not in the least oblique. Nothing is too short or too long. Anything this perfect must be something of God Himself; only God Himself is so perfect.</p>
<p>The measurements of the three dimensions are twelve thousand stadia. Twelve thousand is twelve times one thousand. Psalm 84:10 says that a day in the courts of God is better than a thousand, and 2 Peter 3:8 says that to the Lord a thousand years is as one day. In addition, the kingdom age will be one thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6). In the Scriptures, therefore, one thousand is the number of fullness. Moreover, that the city was twelve thousand stadia in three directions implies the Triune God in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Pure and Transparent</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:18 says, &ldquo;And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.&rdquo; The city is the New Jerusalem as a whole, while the wall is built around the city for separation. While the city is pure gold, the wall is jasper. The wall, which is jasper, gives the appearance of the city, while the city proper, which is surrounded by the wall, is pure gold, like clear glass. Gold in biblical typology signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature. Second Peter 1:4 tells us that we have become partakers of the divine nature. The divine nature within us is likened to pure and transparent gold with no mixture or alloy.</p>
<p>Many times we are not transparent but opaque because we are still living in the soulish life. According to our experience, the more we live in the soul, the self, and the flesh, the more we are opaque, but whenever we are willing for the cross to deal with our self, flesh, and natural life, we become clear and transparent within. Very often brothers ask me how to know the leading of the Lord. There is only one way; we have to apply the cross to ourselves again and again. In order to be clear about the Lord&rsquo;s will and guidance, we must stay on the altar. The more we apply the cross and are dealt with by the cross, the more we are clear and transparent, and the divine nature within us is clear as glass.</p>
<p>The divine nature is transparent. Although it is gold, it is not opaque gold. Opaqueness is due to our fallen nature. If we still remain in the self and in the flesh, we cannot be clear. This is why we have to be broken. With just a little bit of breaking, the light will shine out from within. We may think that light comes from above, but in actuality it comes from within. The light is within us already, but something is covering it. When our self, the flesh, the natural life, and the old man are broken even a little, the light shines out and we are clear. God&rsquo;s divine nature is pure gold, like clear glass.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Produced by the Experiences of Christ<br />
through Heat and Pressure</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:19 and 20 say, &ldquo;The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.&rdquo; The city proper is gold, signifying the divine nature within us. The divine nature is our common portion. As long as we believe in the Lord Jesus, we all have the divine nature. However, we are different with respect to the precious stones. Some believers only have the gold, the divine nature, which they received when they were saved. They do not have much of the precious stones built up within them. The precious stones signify the work of the Holy Spirit within. At the time we were saved, we received the divine nature, but after that, how much we have of precious stones built in us depends on how much we allow the Holy Spirit to work within us. The work of the Holy Spirit after we are saved is the work of building something of Christ in us, signified by the precious stones.</p>
<p>Gold is an element originally created by God. Precious stones, however, were not originally created by God. They are a compounding of other elements under the processes of burning heat and high pressure. Trees, for example, are burned into carbon and then pressed over a long period of time to become precious stones. We must be burned and pressed. Do not be frightened by this word; many of us have this kind of experience. Many times the Lord arranges an &ldquo;oven&rdquo; for us. Sometimes the Lord uses a high temperature, and other times He uses a lower one, just as a sister knows at what heat to bake something. Many times the Lord has put me into the oven in this way. Even the dear ones around us become a high heat to us. Sometimes our wife is not sufficient for this; we also need some children to &ldquo;burn&rdquo; us. A wife may &ldquo;burn&rdquo; her husband, and then the children cooperate to also burn him. However, the sisters do not have an easy life either. Many husbands are a burning heat to burn their wives. We praise the Lord for the burning and pressing. Originally, we are only wood, grass, and stubble (1 Cor. 3:12), so we need the burning and pressing that we may become precious stones.</p>
<p>We gain the real experiences of Christ not by speaking about them but by the work of the Holy Spirit, and many times these experiences are of burning and pressing. At times we may meet a brother and realize that with him there is something very precious, not precious in doctrine but precious in the experiences of being burned and pressed. In 2 Corinthians 1:8 Paul said that he was pressed beyond his power. This was so that he could become a precious stone. The gold is common to us all; every regenerated person has gold from the day he is saved. But how much of the precious stones do we have? How many precious experiences of Christ by the working of the Holy Spirit under burning and pressing do we have? These experiences are good for the building, protection, separation, and expression of God. The expression, protection, sanctification, and separation always depend on this kind of precious experiences of Christ.</p>
<p>People often misuse Romans 8:28, which says that all things work together for good. We should not quote verse 28, however, while forgetting about verse 29, which says that we are being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son. All things do not work together for our peace, joy, or enjoyment. Rather, all things work together for good to burn us and press us that we may be conformed to the image of the Son of God. Some may testify that formerly they had a poor house, but due to circumstances they received a better house; all things worked together for good that they would receive a new house. Many people testify in this way, misusing Romans 8:28. We should turn this kind of testimony upside down. If one day we lose our house and are put out onto the street, we should say, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord. All things work together for good that I may be burned and pressed in order to be conformed to the image of the Son of God.&rdquo; We need the mercy of the Lord. Our circumstances are not in our hands. They are in His hands. He knows how to handle us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 4: Revelation &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
