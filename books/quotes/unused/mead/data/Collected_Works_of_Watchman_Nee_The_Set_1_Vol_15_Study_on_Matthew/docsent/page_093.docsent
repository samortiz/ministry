   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 26:"Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>False Christs and false prophets have already been mentioned several times in verses 5, 11, 23, 24, etc. Here they are mentioned again to emphasize the importance of this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the wilderness, a place far from the world, it is easy for people to think that this is a likely place for Christ to be found.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When John the Baptist was in the wilderness, some asked him if he was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Inner rooms" are mysterious places, secret places.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psychologically, whatever is mysterious has power and attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When something is no longer secret, it loses its power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Corinthians did not like Paul because his appearance was not outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 27:"For just as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Lightning" is in the sky, and everyone can see it, but not everyone can see what is in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the Lord's coming will be entirely public; He will come on the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people say that the Lord's coming to the earth will be in a stealthy way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the first rapture will be in secret; His coming to the air will remain secret.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As lightning is hidden in the clouds waiting for the opportunity to strike, so Christ first hides in the clouds for a period of time; then He will come on the clouds Rev 1:7; Acts 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the book of Acts it is recorded that when the Lord ascended to the heavens, at first there was no cloud; then a cloud received Him out of their sight.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When He comes, the situation will be the same, only the order will be reversed: first, there will be clouds to cover and hide including the period of the rapture ; then there will be the appearing coming .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the saints will have already been raptured before His coming; hence, we are not waiting for the coming of the parousia but are waiting for the going of the parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 28:"Wherever the corpse is, there will the vultures be gathered together."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Corpse...vultures."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to some, the "corpse" signifies Christ, and the "vultures" signify Christians, because from the time the Lord died, Christians have eaten His flesh referring to the taking of the bread .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not only inaccurate but is even ridiculous and ungodly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible not only speaks concerning the death of Christ; it also speaks concerning His living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The One in whom we believe is the Lord who died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is not a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul told the Corinthians that "if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also" 1 Cor 15:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A corpse also stinks and is rotten John 11:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This could never refer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What then is the explanation of the corpse?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1 A corpse plus life equals a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A living person minus life equals a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, the corpse represents those who are without life, that is, all those who are in Adam 1 Cor 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Believers are not in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They have life; thus, they should not be called corpses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord said, "This is My body," indicating life; it is not a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>2 Corpses stink John 11:39; 1 Cor 15:50, 53 ; therefore, when men die, they are buried Gen 23:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, a corpse also refers to corruption, to the rottenness of those who die in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The vulture in the Bible has several meanings: 1 It refers to God's people Isa 40:31; Deut 32:11 these two verses emphasize the way of the flying of the eagle .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2 In Leviticus the eagle is considered abominable because it eats carcasses 11:13-14; Rev 19:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The eagles' eating of the carcasses represents God's judgment, so here it should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Wherever there is the rottenness of the dead person in Adam, God's judgment is there also.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here, the reason it is explained spiritually is that in the previous text there was the parable of the lightning .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 29:"And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word "immediately" is most precious and important.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reference to the sun, the moon, and the stars is literal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some say that this means that the kings, high officers, generals, princes, etc. will be shaken, but if so, the sun, the moon, and the stars would have already been shaken before the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The calamities in Matthew 24:29 and Revelation 6:12-13 are similar, but the times in which they take place are different.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Revelation it is mentioned that after the sixth seal there are the calamities of the trumpets and of the bowls.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sixth seal is merely the beginning of the calamities, but here in Matthew the things are after the calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Immediately after the tribulation of those days."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This shows that the tribulation will begin with the change of the heavenly scene and also end with the change of the celestial bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Joel 2:31 and the sixth seal in Revelation refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Joel said explicitly that the time will be before the tribulation: "Before the great and terrible / Day of Jehovah comes" 2:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matthew said explicitly that the time will be after the tribulation: "Immediately after the tribulation of those days."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we know that these two take place at two different times.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 30:"And at that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"At that time" refers to the time immediately after the tribulation in verse 29.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We do not know what the sign of the Son of Man will be.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are two common explanations: 1 The Lord Himself but this is not proper because the Lord said "the sign of the Son of Man"; He did not say the Son of Man Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>2 The cross the reason is based on Matthew 12, where the Lord gave the sign of Jonah to the scribes and the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The latter might be the better explanation, but we are still not completely certain.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, in our explanation here, we do not say that it is the cross, nor do we say that it is not the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But we do know that the sign here must be mysterious and also supernatural because it appears in the sky so that all the tribes can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"All the tribes of the land" means all the tribes of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will mourn see Zech 12:10-14 .</S>
