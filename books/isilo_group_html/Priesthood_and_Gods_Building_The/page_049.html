<h1 class="title">LIVING THE PRIESTLY LIFE<br />
BY EXERCISING THE SPIRIT TO SING AND PRAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18-19; 6:18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES&rsquo; LIVING BEING<br />
FILLED WITH SINGING AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>When the apostle Paul spoke of the Christian life in the book of Ephesians, he specifically mentioned singing hymns and praying (5:18-19; 6:18). Both of these matters are related to our spirit. In order to sing hymns of praise to God, we need to &ldquo;be filled in spirit,&rdquo; and when we pray, we need to pray &ldquo;every time in spirit.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s writing was based on personal experience, and the book of Acts shows how the apostles lived. On one hand, they sang hymns of praise to God (2:47; 16:25), and on the other hand, they prayed (1:24; 6:4; 9:40; 10:9; 13:3; 14:23; 16:25). This is how they lived in ordinary circumstances and in difficult circumstances. When Paul and Silas were in prison, they sang hymns of praise to God; their singing resulted in a great earthquake that opened the prison doors (16:19-26). When they encountered problems, they cried out to the Lord. They sang hymns in spirit and prayed in spirit. As a result, their spirit was strengthened and released.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO LIVE THE PRIESTLY LIFE<br />
BY FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>We should lead the saints to live a priestly life by praying and fellowshipping with the Lord in the Holy of Holies in a practical way. The Lord&rsquo;s greatest need today is to gain brothers and sisters who will live a priestly life according to grace. We must come forward to the throne of grace to fellowship with God, and we must come forward with all the saints to serve Him as priests. This will cause God&rsquo;s purpose to be accomplished among us. The leading in the church should be focused on this matter.</p>
<p>Concerning prayer, many saints have a great lack in the exercise of their spirit. In Christianity the situation is even more desolate. Even when hundreds or thousands of people gather together, very few pray in spirit. In Sunday worship services most people are listening, and although some are praying, very few are praying in spirit. We highly regard giving messages and listening to messages, but we pay little attention to praying and singing hymns in spirit; we are lacking in the exercise and release of the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO OUTWARD ACTIVITIES<br />
BUT NEGLECTING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christians pay attention to outward matters, such as giving messages and listening to messages, and they focus on outward activities. However, they do not exercise their spirit when they pray, sing hymns, worship God, and fellowship with Him. As a consequence, their spirit is rather weak and not easily released. Their fellowship with others also rarely involves a mutual blending in spirit. The human body is a good example that illustrates our need to exercise. Every organ in our body has the human life and a specific function that requires exercise. Our feet have life and the function of walking, but it is difficult to walk without exercise. The need for exercise is even more important when we consider our spirit. Having been born in Adam, we are fallen, and our spirit was dead and without function. Before we were saved, we did not live according to our spirit, because our spirit was deadened. Even after being regenerated, it is not easy to exercise our spirit due to our old, habitual living and the influence of our environment. This is true even when we pray. We know that we should use our spirit to pray, just as we should use our feet to walk, our eyes to see, and our ears to hear; nevertheless, we often fail to exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>Often when we pray, we merely use our mind, or we are stirred up in our emotion, but we rarely pray according to the sense deep within our spirit. Our spirit is like a withering plant because we lack this kind of exercise, and it is not easy for our spirit to be released. Some saints can release their spirit as soon as they open their mouth, but other saints can pray for five or six minutes and still not touch their spirit. Furthermore, if they are fully occupied in their mind, their prayers will reflect only their emotions and thoughts. If we do not exercise our spirit, our spirit will be dormant, and it will be hard to release our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING THOUGHTS AND UTTERANCES<br />
FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our spirit is released through words, and words depend on clear thoughts for their expression. The spirit needs words, and words need clear thoughts. Praying more in our daily living increases our exercise and improves our utterances by training our thoughts. Although we pray with our spirit, we need the cooperation of our mind. If we meet with some English-speaking brothers and sisters, and our English is not very good, it will be difficult to release our spirit when we are inspired; even if we release our spirit, our utterance will be limited by language. We must practice to be focused in our thoughts in order to express the sense in our spirit; the more we practice, the more skillful we will become. Then we will be able to express the sense in our spirit with flowing thoughts and appropriate words.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
