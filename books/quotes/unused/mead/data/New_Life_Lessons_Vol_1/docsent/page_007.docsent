   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEETING MEETING IS THE LIFE PULSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE CENTER OF THE CHURCH LIFE I. THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>MEETING IS THE LORD S COMMAND</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hebrews 10:25</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together is the Bible s command, as well as God s command to His children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we cease meeting together, we interrupt the church life, because our meeting life is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Meeting is to a Christian as water is to a fish, air to a bird, and breathing to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>MEETING IS THE CHARACTERISTIC</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>OF CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christians, like sheep and bees,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>like to flock together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since meeting is a demand of our inner life,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>it must be our way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, not only must we meet often, but we must meet to such an extent that it becomes a habit, thus producing a meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is like the need to eat and drink daily in the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>RECEIVING THE CORPORATE GRACE IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s grace to man is twofold:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The individual side through one s own reading of the Bible, praying, seeking, and fellowshipping with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The corporate side through meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example:</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1 Bible reading: The light we receive when we read the Bible by ourselves is limited, but in the meetings it is abundant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2 Prayer: Many matters that cannot be solved by individual prayers are readily solved by corporate prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3 Spiritual problems: Weaknesses and problems that are insurmountable individually are taken care of many times in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>4 The Lord s presence: It was during a meeting that the Lord appeared to the disciples on the night of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these blessings are given to us by the Lord in the meetings and only in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE KINDS OF MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Acts 2:42</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house...</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Acts 2:46</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Acts 5:42</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Acts 20:20</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The New Testament shows us that there are two kinds of church meetings, each having its function:</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The big meetings: educational, as in a school</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>1 Releasing the truth, supplying life</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2 Expounding the Bible, teaching the truths</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Goal: That all the saints may know the truths and may live in God s New Testament economy</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The home meetings: Home nurturing, as in a family</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Method:</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1 Continuing in the apostles teaching and fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2 Breaking bread to remember the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>3 Praying calling on the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>4 Preaching the gospel</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>5 Speaking the truth</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Functions:</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>1 Upholding the saints shepherding and caring for them</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2 Recovering the ones who have not been coming to the meetings seeking and contacting them</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>3 Bringing in the new ones preaching the gospel to relatives, friends, and neighbors</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus we can see that the home meetings are the foundation of the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The heaven and the earth may pass away, but the home meetings must not be forsaken.</S>
