   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO TABLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we have this realization concerning the Lord s table, we shall be able to understand 1 Corinthians 10.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul s concept here is that whenever a person eats of idol sacrifices, he enjoys something related to an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, what he enjoys gets into him and causes him to become an expression of that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is based on the principle that eating is a fellowship, a participation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul uses the word fellowship with the meaning of participation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to this view, to eat the sacrifices offered to idols is to have fellowship with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, it is to become involved with idols and eventually to become one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is in keeping with the fact that we are what we eat, that what we eat becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because demons are behind idols, to be one with idols is to be one with the demons behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is an explanation of Paul s concept in chapter ten concerning the eating of idol sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The result of eating sacrifices to idols is that a person becomes one with demons and even filled and saturated with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same principle, to eat the body of Christ is to have the fellowship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is to participate in Christ and to become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not simply a doctrine or principle; it is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Demons also are spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The life-giving Spirit is rich and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The demonic spirits, on the contrary, are evil and unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One can be saturated and occupied either by a demon, an evil spirit, or by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We live according to that with which we are occupied and saturated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we eat Christ and are saturated with Him as the life-giving Spirit, we shall live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In like manner, if we eat the sacrifices to demons and are saturated with demons, we shall live demons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ultimately, in the entire universe there are only two tables: the table of demons, which causes people to be one with demons, and the table of the Lord, which causes the believers to be one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In either case, we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is called communion in today s Christendom is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Behind it there are some things related to idols, and demons are behind the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who partake of the table of demons come in contact with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means they actually touch the reality of the demons behind the table of the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The principle is the same with the dear saints who come to the Lord s table in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They touch the reality of the Lord as they partake of His table.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Often in the words of these believers we can sense something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We realize that in the words of a certain brother or sister we can hear the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These saints can speak such a word because they have been saturated with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is a problem among the saints when they come to the Lord s table, the church life will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There can be no building up of the church in such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if the saints in a local church have no problems when they come to the Lord s table, and if everyone fellowships with the Lord and with others in spirit, that is a church, a temple, which has truly been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, with the temple of God there is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who have become the temple and the kingdom through the enjoyment of Christ are surely those who live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we read 1 Corinthians 10 in this light, we shall have a proper understanding of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We shall realize that idolatry involves the enjoyment of something other than the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today people everywhere are practicing idolatry, for they are enjoying many things which are not the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The living of worldly people is a living in idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They sit down to eat and drink, and then they rise up to play.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who engage in worldly entertainments and who purchase many of the worldly things sold in department stores are practicing idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Idolatry is the enjoyment of something in place of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord s table is the true enjoyment of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord s table is not only a matter of a meeting on the Lord s Day; this table should be our enjoyment every day, even continually.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Day by day, the Lord is our good land, our feast, our table.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we come to the Lord s table with this understanding, we shall come with a different spirit and a different realization.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The cup of blessing which we bless is certainly the fellowship of the blood of Christ, and the bread which we break is the fellowship of the body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today we are those gathered around the altar, enjoying whatever is offered on the altar for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we are feasting, we satisfy the Lord whom we worship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the proper dealing with the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The proper way to deal with eating is to feast on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not eat anything other than the Lord, and do not enjoy anything in place of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not have any enjoyment other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is our table, our feast, our land.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the good land, Christ is a rich feast for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we feast on Him, we live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we are able to defeat the enemies, establish the kingdom of God, and build up His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is God s goal and the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
