   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Of Minerals</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning minerals, we read of gold, silver, bronze, onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These materials were not used for decoration or ornamentation; they were all used for building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The onyx stones and other precious stones were used for the shoulder-pieces and the breastplate worn by the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the high priest entered the Holy of Holies to minister before the Lord, he wore the ephod with the shoulder pieces and the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Using the Urim and the Thummim along with the breastplate, the high priest could receive a message from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The breastplate worn by the high priest was not an ornament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a sense it may be regarded as a divine typewriter used to spell out messages from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The point here is that the breastplate was built with minerals, with precious stones set in gold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fact that the minerals were mentioned as the first category indicates that whatever Christ is and whatever He has done and is doing are all for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The building is God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The consummation of the divine revelation is the New Jerusalem built with gold, precious stones, and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible is altogether consistent concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The minerals in 25:1-9 are for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Corinthians 3:10 and 11 Paul says that as a wise master builder he laid the foundation, and this foundation is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then he says, Let each one take heed how he builds upon it v. 10 . In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Notice that in this verse Paul speaks of minerals: gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of building with gold, silver, and precious stones, many Christians use wood, grass, and stubble, materials that have no value and are good only for burning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, in 2 Timothy 2:20 Paul says that in a great house there are vessels not only of gold and silver, vessels unto honor, but also wooden and earthen vessels, vessels unto dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Life-study of 2 Timothy we pointed out that this great house does not signify the church as the house of God, but it signifies Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In today s Christianity only a small number are using precious minerals to build God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The majority of so-called Christian workers use wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The best of these workers use wood; the others use straw or stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The minerals in 25:1-9 signify Christ as the building material ordained by God and prepared by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although Christ is this building material, God does not use this material directly to build up His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, God gives Christ to us that we may gain Him, enjoy Him, and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Like Paul in Philippians 3, we need to pursue Christ, gain Christ, and take possession of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, Christ becomes our possession both in resurrection and in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the meetings of the church we should then offer to God as a heave offering the Christ we have experienced and who has become our special treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we release our spirit by functioning in the meetings, we need to have Christ as our content.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we merely shout praises to the Lord without Christ as our content, we shall not be offering the surplus of Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I encourage all the saints to function in the meetings and to release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this function and release must be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This Christ is not objective; He is the subjective Christ experienced by us and gained by us as our treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the meetings we should offer this precious Christ to the Father as the material for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we see that Christ is the material for God s building, offered to God as a heave offering, we shall mourn over the pitiful situation among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many pride themselves on their education and theological knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A few years ago a certain person boasted to me of the large number of people in his organization who have doctoral degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But Moses was not a theologian, and the Lord Jesus did not have a doctoral degree.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, in appearance he was an unlearned Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Others marveled and said concerning Him, How does this man know letters, having never learned?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 7:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus even rebuked the so-called learned ones, calling them a brood of vipers Matt 23:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These religious leaders had poisoned God s people, but the Lord Jesus came to heal the people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who boast of their degrees and theological knowledge actually have only a superficial knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Have they seen that Christ is the material for God s building?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Praise the Lord that Christ is the precious material for the building of God s dwelling place!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have pointed out that the high priest wore a breastplate made of precious materials when he came into God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we experience Christ as the building materials and put Him on as the breastplate when we come into God s presence, we shall receive God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The revelation comes through the Christ we have experienced and who becomes the building material worn by us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord s recovery is absolutely different from today s religion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not concerned with knowing the Bible merely in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are here to carry out God s economy in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is impossible for there to be reconciliation between the recovery and Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the recovery we repudiate the wood, the grass, and the stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But these inferior materials are not only welcomed by many Christians they are appreciated, praised, exalted, and advertised.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many Christian publications even make a display of wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the recovery we would rather have a small amount of gold, silver, and precious stones than a huge pile of wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We deeply regret the fact that the spiritual eyes of many religious leaders and Bible teachers are blind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They may study the Word in letters, but they do not know the mysterious reality of verses such as 25:1-9.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not care for the traditional teachings, but for God s revelation in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Gold, Signifying Christ s Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The first of the minerals mentioned in 25:1-9 is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Gold signifies Christ s divine nature and it is pure and everlasting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Jesus, the Nazarene, there was the divine nature, although this gold was concealed within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to experience Christ s hidden divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, in all that a brother does as a husband, father, or employee he should have Christ s divine nature hidden within him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Others may wonder about him and sense that there is something weighty and valuable with him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The religionists were puzzled by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They knew that He was a carpenter, and some even knew His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Nevertheless, they wondered how He could do and say certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The cause of their wonder was the divine nature concealed within this Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even the young people among us need to experience Christ in His pure and everlasting divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then they will give the impression to others at school or in the neighborhood that they possess something weighty and valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In their speech and behavior they will convey the impression that they have something admirable within.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I thank the Lord that many of our young people do bear such a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What we experience and possess of Christ s divine nature we should bring to the meetings and offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those who are still in high school should not think that they are too young to present such a heave offering to God for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I can testify that when the young people function in this way, I am edified and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all need the experience of the gold, the divine nature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we need to offer this element of the Christ we have experienced to God as a heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need to experience Him, possess Him, and then offer Him to God for the building of His dwelling place.</S>
