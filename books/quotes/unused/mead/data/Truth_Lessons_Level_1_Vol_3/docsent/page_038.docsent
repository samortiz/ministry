   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Forgetting the Sins of the Forgiven Ones</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When God forgives us of our sins, He also forgets our sins Heb 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When God forgives us, He not only exempts us from suffering the penalty of sin and causes our sins to depart from us, but He also forgets our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once He forgives us, He erases our sins from His memory and remembers them no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. The Position and Authority to Forgive Sins 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Luke 5:21 says, Who can forgive sins but God alone?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, God alone has the position and authority to forgive, because He alone has the position and authority to condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Besides Him, no one has such position and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man is not the Lord of the universe; furthermore, man is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God alone is the Lord of the universe, and He alone is sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, only God is able to condemn, and only God is able to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son of Man the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Luke 5:24 says, The Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the Lord Jesus is a man, He is also the very God who came to the earth to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is a man and He is also God; He is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is a perfect man, and He is sinless Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is also the complete God and the Lord of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, like God, He has the position and authority to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. The Basis for Forgiveness of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s forgiveness is based on the shedding of blood Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because He is righteous, God cannot forgive sins without a basis.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His righteousness requires that all who sin must die Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unless His righteous requirement is satisfied, His righteousness cannot allow Him to forgive sinners of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But since the Lord Jesus has died and shed His blood on the cross for men, thus satisfying God s righteous requirement, God can legally forgive men of their sins Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since the blood of the Lord Jesus was shed in His death for men according to God s righteousness as the price to satisfy God s righteous requirement, it has become the basis upon which the sins of those who believe in Him may be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Besides His blood, nothing else neither man s good works and virtues nor man s zeal and love can be the basis for the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because in the universe only His blood can satisfy all the righteous requirements of God on sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. The Way for Sinners to Receive</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Forgiveness of Sins 1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Repentance</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To receive forgiveness of sins from God, a sinner must repent Luke 24:47; Acts 5:31; Isa 55:6-7 , turning back to God in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Formerly he had his back toward God; thus, he sinned against God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now, if he desires God s forgiveness, he must turn back to God, forsaking his own way and abandoning his own thoughts, thus turning to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Faith</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To receive forgiveness of sins from God a sinner must not only repent but also believe Acts 10:43; 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the negative side, to repent is to turn to God from the position of being against God; on the positive side, to believe is to receive from God His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Neither repentance nor faith is a merit by which a sinner may receive forgiveness from God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A sinner can be forgiven by God only on the merit of the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is only because of the Lord s blood that God can grant the grace of forgiveness of sins to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, sinners can receive the grace of forgiveness of sins from God only through their repentance and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because the blood which the Lord Jesus shed on the cross has satisfied all God s righteous requirements on sinners, God can bestow upon them the grace of forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, a sinner still cannot be forgiven unless he repents and believes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He can receive God s forgiveness only through repentance and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus has accomplished on the cross all the work that enables God to forgive sinners and all the work that enables sinners to receive forgiveness from God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For a sinner to receive God s forgiveness, it is not required of him to do anything other than to repent and turn to God and to exercise his faith to receive it from God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>E. The Limits of Forgiveness of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Matthew 12:31 says, Every sin...shall be forgiven men.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, no matter how broad or how great the limits of our sins are, the limits of God s forgiveness are just as broad and great.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s forgiveness is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is sufficient to encompass all our sins and to solve all our problem of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the cross the Lord Jesus made redemption for every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, based upon the Lord s redemption, God can forgive every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God and everything of Him is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, His forgiveness is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since God never does anything incompletely, He cannot give us an incomplete forgiveness or a partial forgiveness, forgiving us of some of our sins and not forgiving us of other sins.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once He forgives us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He forgives us of all sins and all offenses Col 2:13 .</S>
