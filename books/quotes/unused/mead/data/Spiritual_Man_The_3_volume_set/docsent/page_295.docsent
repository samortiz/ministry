   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God will never be submissive to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is not happy with anything but His will and our submission to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Things that are fairer, better, greater, and more important cannot replace God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What God will fulfill is His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If He does not fulfill His own will, it is hard to expect us to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In God's eyes, all the best things are corrupted as long as they contain the element of man's self.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many things are wonderful and profitable if they are done according to the leading of the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if they are done by man himself, their value before God is completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, it is not a matter of man's tendency or a matter of the nature of things; it is a matter of what God's will is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the first point to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we need to ask how man's will can be in harmony with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can man be delivered from having the self-will as his center to having God's will as his center?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The key to the whole matter is the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The degree to which we are severed from the control of the soul-life is the degree of the union between God and us because nothing hinders our union with God besides the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We seek after God's will to the extent that we lose our soul-life and to the extent that our will takes God as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because the new life is naturally inclined toward God and is suppressed only by the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way to achieve the goal is to deliver the soul-life to death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without God, man perishes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without God, everything is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything that is outside of God is of the flesh the self .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, outside of God, whatever is done by one's own effort and according to one's own thought is condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A believer must deny all of his own strength and desires.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He must not care for himself in anything and not do anything with his self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He must completely trust God in everything and go forward step by step according to God's ways, waiting upon God's time, and according to God's requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He must be willing to accept the strength, wisdom, goodness, righteousness, and work that is from God as his own.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He must confess that God is the source of everything he has.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only in this way is harmony possible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is truly a "narrow way," but it is not a difficult way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is narrow because each step is regulated by God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This way has only one principle, which is to not reserve any ground for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As such, it is a narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A little deviation from God's will takes us away from this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, this is not a difficult way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the soul-life is consumed, habits, hobbies, desires, and cravings are broken one by one, and nothing opposes God anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consequently, one does not feel that it is a difficult way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unfortunately, many believers have not even entered the door or walked on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are also some who do not have patience and who leave this way before reaching the point of sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But whether the period of hardship is long or short, one thing is certain: only this way is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, it is true and sure.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whoever wants to have abundant life has no choice but to walk in this way.</S>
