<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>Of course, for the spreading of the gospel, the teaching of the truth, the ministering of life, and the building up of the church, we still need some full-time serving ones. For this reason, the support for the full-timers is very crucial. I would rather sacrifice the big meeting hall in Lin-ko than neglect the need of the full-timers. Whether or not we can build the big meeting hall is a secondary matter. The primary goal is to raise up two thousand five hundred full-timers. I have heard that some halls or churches feel that the burden for the support of the full-timers is too heavy, and they are considering &ldquo;down-sizing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;laying off,&rdquo; some of the full-timers. I beg you before the Lord, not to do this. This should never happen. We must have a strong resolution within ourselves that even if we must sell everything, we need to increase the number of full-timers. Even if we must sell our hall, we need to continue our effort to produce more full-timers. I feel that even if we must sell the land in Lin-ko, and even if we must borrow a few million dollars from other places, we need to do it to continue supporting the full-timers. We must reach the goal of having two thousand five hundred full-timers.</p>
<p>I also hope that we can increase the support of the full-timers. The budget for them is too small. They have given up their future, their positions, and consecrated everything to the Lord and the church. The church should take care of their needs. We should not be afraid of giving them too much. We are not afraid to do too much in other things. Why are we afraid to be too much when it comes to supporting the full-timers? This is an attack from Satan. It delays the work of the Lord&rsquo;s building. We must not be afraid of doing too much. We should only be afraid that we have not done enough. If the full-timers squander the support that the church gives them, and if they spend their money on unnecessary things, it proves that they are not qualified to be full-timers, and they should not serve full-time. When the full-timers hear this word, they should bow down to worship the Lord, and they should also serve with fear and trembling.</p>
<p>Let me give my own testimony. The Lord used me to spread His work from Southeast Asia to the West. In twenty-three years, more than a hundred churches have been raised up in South America, North America, Europe, Africa, and Australasia. I admit that the Lord has used me to some extent, and the brothers and sisters have respected me and have supplied me abundantly. Still, other than expenses related to daily necessities, I have offered up all the money I have received year after year. During my twenty-three years in the United States, I have purchased only one small automobile, which was a second-hand car for which I paid eight hundred dollars. Eventually, I gave it away to a poorer brother, and I lived without a car of my own. What I am saying is that if the young people receive more supply from the Lord, they should learn to give. If we keep everything to ourselves, we are not qualified to be a full-timer. We must learn to take care of others.</p>
<p>As I have said before, years ago in Southeast Asia one brother received the burden to care for all the needs of the work in Taiwan. His offering not only made possible the purchase of the many pieces of property in Taiwan for building meeting halls, it also supported the livelihood of the full-timers. Beginning in 1950 there was a need to supply more than one hundred seventy people. Although not all their needs were covered, they were supplied enough to not experience total deprivation. Up until 1963 I was still supporting part of their needs from America. The churches gradually picked up the support, and by 1967 I was completely relieved of this burden. During this time, while I was in the United States, I experienced extreme hardship myself, yet the Lord did not fail to provide a bountiful supply.</p>
<p>Brothers, let me say a fair word. Those who receive the supply should realize that the money they are spending is the hard-earned money of the saints, who offer out of their love for the Lord. Such a love is priceless. The receiving ones should not take it lightly or spend the money loosely. At the same time, when they have an excess, they should take care of the needs of other saints. The church should be liberal in its support of the full-timers, but it should be careful in its own spending. On their part, the full-timers should be faithful in the way they handle money, and they should also take care of others.</p>
<p>By this summer at least a hundred full-timers will be produced in Taipei, but in order to gospelize Taiwan, we need to have two thousand five hundred by 1988. We need at least a thousand of them now. This is not an easy target to reach. I hope that we will be clear that the building of the big meeting hall in Lin-ko is not our primary goal. Our unique goal is the work of gospelizing Taiwan. For the need of the gospel in its various aspects, we need to work with what we have. If our finances permit us, we will buy gospel vans. If they do not permit us, we will use public transportation, but we cannot give up the work of gospelization. We do not want a big meeting hall without the power of the gospel or the practical spreading of the gospel.</p>
<p>Some may criticize me for always changing my way. In reality, as long as we want to improve, we need to change. The reason Taiwan is so prosperous today is that it does not limit itself to one method. It improves from one method to the next. This keeps us from failure. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery I have worked from Chefoo to Shanghai to Taiwan, and from Southeast Asia to the West. I have had smooth sailing, and my morale is as strong as ever. The reason for this is that I vowed to succeed in all my endeavors. Of course, I have had failures, but I was not discouraged and did not lose heart. Instead, I considered the failures to be the predecessors to success. Failure or success lies not in the attainment of the goal but in the heart. The revolution of Mr. Sun Yat-sen experienced many failures, but in the end it was a success. It was a success because his goal was clear and his aim was single. I am clear that the new way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will become a success because our goal is right and our motive is pure.</p>
<p>We all admit that Mr. Sun Yat-sen rescued the Chinese nation. History has justified his achievements. In principle, this can be compared to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today; its justification is undisputed. Six thousand years of human history have culminated in the consummate truth of the Bible, and this truth is what we are working out in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is the reason we have the boldness and assurance to point out the mistakes of Christianity in the United States. Because of the slander of the evil ones, we were engaged in a legal battle. Thank the Lord that the truth eventually prevailed. One theologian even wrote a book to defend our position. This is because our goal is clear, our truth is accurate, and our motive is pure.</p>
<p>This litigation cost more than five million dollars. No one thought that we would have the courage to carry it out, but my mind was set. I would fight this battle even if it meant selling the hall in Anaheim. In the end, we did not sell our hall in Anaheim. Instead, we built the Irving meeting hall in the midst of the litigation. Do not think that I was fighting that battle alone. I did this in the Body and with all of you. Today we need to see that we are in the Body. We are co-workers together, and we have the same future. If today in Taipei we can reach the high ground of the new way, we will have secured a great victory for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We will build up the church in the believers&rsquo; homes and accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal economy. Just as you encouraged me during the litigation process, I want to encourage you today, and I want to be encouraged through your encouragement.</p>
