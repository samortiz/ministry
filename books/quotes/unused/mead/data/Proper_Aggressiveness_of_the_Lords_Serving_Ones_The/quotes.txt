[1]  The Proper Aggressiveness of the Lord's Serving Ones CONTENTS
[2]  The Pursuit, Character, and Service of the Full-timers
[3]  First Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus, the three T books in the New Testament, are Epistles written by Paul to his two young co-workers, Timothy and Titus.
[4]  The subject of 1 Timothy is God s economy concerning the church, the subject of 2 Timothy is an inoculation against the decline of the church, and the subject of Titus is the maintenance of order in the church.
[5]  These are three aspects of one purpose, that is, to preserve the church as the proper expression of the Triune God.
[6]  According to 1 Timothy 2:7, Paul was appointed a herald and an apostle..., a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
[7]  Here faith refers to faith in Christ, and truth refers to the reality of all things in the economy of God as revealed in the New Testament.
[8]  For instance, the Word becoming flesh, the death and resurrection of the Lord, and the Lord being the life-giving Spirit are all items of the truth, the reality in the economy of God.
[9]  Just as a surgeon must know the human body so that he never randomly cuts a necessary part of the body, we must know the word of the truth so that when we expound the word of reality, the word of the truth, in the New Testament, we cut the word straight without any slant, curve, or distortion.
[10]  We also need to be a pattern in love.
[11]  The object of a person s love usually is an indication of whether or not he is childish.
[12]  A person who is learning to serve the Lord should pray, Lord, cause me not to give others any ground to say that I am childish, naive, and without learning in my conduct, actions, and words.
[13]  AND SERVICE OF THE FULL-TIMERS NEEDING A SPIRIT OF PRAYER AND
[14]  A group of young saints recently consecrated themselves to serve full time.
[15]  From now on the full-time trainees must concentrate on studying the Bible.
[16]  In the Lord s recovery we care only for the revelation of the Bible.
[17]  We strongly disagree with the way of theological seminaries, which distorts the understanding of the Bible.
[18]  Hence, the full-time trainees must realize their urgent need to know the Bible.
[19]  But we will not set up a seminary or a Bible school to address this need.
[20]  Instead, every trainee must spend half a day to study the Bible, until they are well versed in the Bible.
[21]  Your foundation in the Bible is not solid; therefore, we need to rise up and catch up, putting in a good deal of effort to study the Bible.
[22]  Another burden of the training, which will be brought up in subsequent fellowship, is that every full-timer should help a small group.
[23]  This does not mean we will lead the small groups; we will help them.
[24]  On the one hand, I am concerned that the full-timers may become proud upon hearing that they are qualified, designated, and commissioned to help the small groups.
[25]  On the other hand, the brothers and sisters in the small groups may say, Didn t Brother Lee say that there are no responsible ones or leading ones in the small groups?
[26]  FOR THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS TURNING FROM LARGER MEETINGS
[27]  The church is making a turn in its practice from corporate meetings involving all the saints to meetings in small groups.
[28]  Corporate meetings involving all the saints are suitable in a small locality with about one hundred saints, because they can meet the needs of the saints.
[29]  Whereas the administration and the management of a church are with the eldership, the practice of the church life and the building up of the church are carried out in the small groups.
[30]  In the group meetings we should remember that we have no status.
[31]  A full-timer may consider that since he is serving the Lord, he must do a good job even if others do not.
[32]  Some saints have the concept that since the full-timers are supported by the offerings of the saints, the full-timers should labor more than other saints.
[33]  If the saints in a group meeting sit silently, we should learn to be patient and not do anything.
[34]  Even if it is difficult to endure the silence, we should never start anything; we should simply be in the meeting.
[35]  Prayer: Lord, we truly need Your mercy and Your grace.
[36]  We do not know what to do or how to go on, so we look to You to lead us.
[37]  According to our present situation there is an urgent need for the light of the truth and the supply of life in the small groups; there is not much need for in-depth explanation.
[38]  In our practice of the small groups, we need to have the light of the truth and the supply of life.
[39]  When we come to a small group meeting, there should not be any formality.
[40]  Then a more experienced saint may say, Thank the Lord, our fellowship last time was really sweet, and he may continue with a prayer: Lord, we thank You that this brother came last week and was touched and graced by You.
[41]  All the co-workers and elders should participate in the small groups and help the group meetings.
[42]  Especially since we are at the initial stage of the work, we must have a strong beginning.
[43]  We will now consider how to have the bread-breaking meeting.
[44]  We may think that we are experienced, but the structure of our meetings is not definite and clear.
[45]  The focus of the bread-breaking meeting is the remembrance of the Lord, but it is not to remember the Lord s death it is to remember the Lord Himself 1 Cor 11:24-25 .
[46]  The pattern of remembering the Lord in a local church is our family inheritance.
[47]  The first section of the bread-breaking meeting is to remember the Lord, and the second section is to worship the Father.
[48]  Based on the revelation of the Bible, Bible teachers throughout the centuries have used the noun Trinity and the adjective Triune .
[49]  On the one hand, the Bible shows that God is one; on the other hand, the Bible shows the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[50]  For our fellowship concerning the worship of the Father, which is in the second section of the Lord s table meeting, let us read Matthew 26:29-30: I say to you, I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.
[51]  Hence, when the Lord Jesus saw Mary on the morning of His resurrection, He said, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God John 20:17 .
[52]  This light was not seen until the nineteenth century when the Brethren were raised up in England.
[53]  In their study of the Word, they found out that the New Testament worship consists of the remembrance of the Lord and the worship of the Father.
[54]  When we compiled the hymnal that we are using today, we put these hymns into two categories: one is the worship of the Father, and the other is the praise of the Lord.
[55]  We cannot say that the wording of the creed is not appropriate; however, its view is not as thorough, detailed, or complete as the Bible, because the Bible does not reveal the person of Christ and the Triune God by a set of articles but rather in a way that dispenses God into us as enjoyment.
[56]  Furthermore, it is also clearly stated in the New Testament that the Triune God has a move; that is, the Father made a plan, then the Son accomplished the Father s plan, and the Spirit applies the Son s accomplishment.
[57]  For sixty years, from the time I was saved up to the present, I have been attending prayer meetings.
[58]  First I attended prayer meetings in a denomination, then in a Brethren Assembly, and later in the prayer meetings of the church.
[59]  As soon as we step into the meeting, we should not care for anything but to pray.
[60]  The work of the full-time serving ones is mainly with the small groups in their respective localities.
[61]  In order to help the fellowship in a small group, he should first help the saints learn how to read the Word of God.
[62]  I desired to use all my time to read the Bible, pray, fellowship with the Lord, pursue the Lord, serve the Lord, fellowship with the brothers and sisters, and preach the gospel.
[63]  There is also the theology of modernists, who do not even believe that the Bible is God s revelation, that there are signs and wonders, or that the Lord Jesus is God possessing divinity.
[64]  The saints in the Lord s recovery should learn the truths concerning the essential and economical aspects of the Trinity.
[65]  Whereas the essential aspect of the Trinity refers to God s constitution, God s existence, and God Himself, the economical aspect of the Trinity refers to God s plan, God s intention, God s arrangement, God s move, God s acts, and God s work.
[66]  The first step is the Father s plan, the second step is the Son s accomplishment of the Father s plan, and the third step is the Spirit s application of the Son s accomplishment of the Father s plan.
[67]  The Lord then said, I am in the Father and the Father is in Me v. 10 . Hence, we can say that when the Lord Jesus was praying on the earth to the Father in heaven, He was in the Father, and when the Father in heaven listened to Him praying on earth, the Father was in the Son.
[68]  THE LORD S SERVING ONES BEING AGGRESSIVE IN LEARNING
[69]  Question: If a Christian who claims that he is Elijah, sent by Jehovah to help others, comes to our small group meeting, how should we handle him?
[70]  Answer: We should simply tell him, We are open to all who are saved, but we will not receive such speaking.
[71]  If you gave me an English essay to correct, but I did not know English, I could read it a hundred times and still be unable to correct it, because I do not have the necessary knowledge.
