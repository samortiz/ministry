<p>When we talk about the building up of the organic Body of Christ, we are referring to the real, practical, and actual building up of a local church. This building must be in the organic way. We must realize that we cannot build up any church outside of the divine life. We must build up the church with the divine life in the organic way. The organic Body of Christ is built up through the growth of the divine life (Eph. 4:15). In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul said that the church was God&rsquo;s farm and that he planted and Apollos watered, but God made to grow (vv. 9, 6). Planting and watering are organic matters. Planting is for growing something, and watering helps the growth. A local church can only be built up by the way of life through the growth in the divine life. It cannot be built up by any other way. We must find a way to nourish and shepherd all the saints that they may grow.</p>
<p>For the building up of the organic Body of Christ, we need to be fitted and knit together (Eph. 4:16a). A carpenter may fit pieces of wood together to build a table, but this table is not organic. Our physical body is fitted and knit together by life. Medical doctors trust in the life of the body when a person is sick. The life of the body takes care of the body. The proper medicine helps this work. The fitting and knitting is by the growth of life. When we stay together in the church life, it is easy for us to experience some friction with others and be offended. It is very difficult not to offend each other in the church life. Our marriage life and our family life are the same. How then can we be fitted and knit together? It is mainly by the growth in life. We need to help the saints grow in life. The more we grow in life, the more we are fitted and knit together.</p>
<p>This building up of the organic Body of Christ is through every joint of the rich supply (Eph. 4:16b). The joints in the Body of Christ are the gifted persons listed in Ephesians 4:11&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. These gifted persons are the channel of the rich supply. They supply every member of the Body. Thus, the building up of the church is through the supply of these joints.</p>
<p>This building up of the Body is also through the operation in measure of each one part (Eph. 4:16c). Each one part refers to all the members. Every member has his own measure. No matter how small or insignificant we may feel, we need to realize that all of us have our measure. Our thinking that we are insignificant is actually false humility. Each of us has a measure, and this measure has to operate, to work. The building up of the Body is not only through the rich supply of the joints, who are the &ldquo;giants,&rdquo; but also through all the small members. The giants are supplying and the small members are operating, working, in measure. This is why we have to endeavor to practice meeting according to the way revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26. To meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 gives all the members the chance to practice and to develop their function. Each member of the Body of Christ has to work, has to operate. Thus, the Body is built up through the supply of the giants, or the joints, and also through the working, or the operation, of each member in his own measure.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Body must be built up in the organic way through the growth in the divine life and that we need to be fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. The Body causes the growth of itself through the supplying joints and working parts. At the present time, our building up of the church is very short because many of the members do not operate. They attend the church meetings mainly to listen to others. When we come to a meeting, do we prepare ourselves beforehand to function in that meeting? It may be that most of the time we do not purpose to function. We may only be thinking about who is going to speak in the meeting and what we will hear there. We do not think about our operation as a member of the Body. As a result, the building up of the Body in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not that adequate. We still have not helped the saints to grow in life and to develop their function that they all may operate. Functioning is not only in the meetings but also in taking care of the young ones and shepherding the new ones. Many of the saints merely attend the meetings without functioning organically. We cannot see the entire Body fitted and knit together through the growth in life with the great parts supplying and the small parts operating. Because the growth of the Body is not adequate, the Body cannot build itself up.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16 the Lord said that He would build His church (v. 18). But according to the Epistles, the direct building up of the Body is by all the members. The Head, Christ, prepared and gave the gifted persons as joints to the Body to supply the other members and to perfect them to do the building work. Each member of the Body is then perfected by the gifted ones to build up the Body directly. The Body will eventually be a full-grown man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13b). The fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ; this expression has a stature, and this stature has a measure. When the church is built up to be a full-grown man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, there will be no element of any organization, and we will be no more tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of different teaching (Eph. 4:14).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
