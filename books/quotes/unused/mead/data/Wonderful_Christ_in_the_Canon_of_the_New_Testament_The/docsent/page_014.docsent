   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDING OF THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can Christ come into us?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He died on the cross for our sins and shed His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then He was resurrected, and by resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This life-giving Spirit is symbolized by the water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In typology in the Old Testament, the living water came out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today Christ is the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Out of Him has come the living water, the Spirit which is just Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we believe in Him and call, O Lord Jesus, whether we understand justification or not, we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now Christ as the Spirit has come into us, not as a power or an influence, but as a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we are not only saved, but also regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And this living person in us will make us the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But this is what the Bible tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ultimate consummation of the Bible is a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The New Jerusalem, in Revelation 21 and 22, is called the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible closes with the bride of the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, Christ is working within us in the churches to build His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is His ultimate purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This may be new to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some of these terms and even this whole concept may be strange to you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But don t be bothered by this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many specific points of God s revelation have been missed by Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, in the Lord s recovery, He is recovering all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is opening all the mysteries to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All these truths are based upon the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now, I believe, we are all clear about the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the beginning, Christ was the Word who was God, and this Word became flesh to be the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, on the cross, He took away our sins, and by resurrection and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we believe in Him and call on His name, our sins are forgiven and He Himself comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By His life working within us, He will build His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why He is eventually revealed in the book of John as the Holy Breath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word for spirit and breath are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After His resurrection He came back to His disciples to breathe upon them and said, Receive ye the Holy Breath John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is all made clear to us in John s Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE BRIDEGROOM</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we must return to Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Matthew tells us that Jesus is the son of David and the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John starts from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But regardless of how John starts, or from whom Matthew begins, eventually they both tell us nearly the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew also tells us that Jesus is the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matt 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus to ask Him about religion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But Jesus told them that He was the Bridegroom, caring nothing for religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then in Matthew 25, He tells us that He will come back as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him Matt 25:1, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>TWO ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, Matthew still differs somewhat from John.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>John tells us that the Bridegroom will come into us to make us His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Matthew says that the bride must be put into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Gospel of John closes with Jesus coming as the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to come into His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But Matthew closes with Jesus coming after His resurrection to tell His disciples to baptize people into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>. Have you seen these two aspects?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One aspect is that Christ comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The other is that we are baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is so wonderful that we have one verse that covers both aspects: For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit 1 Cor 12:13, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>. On one hand we have been put into the Spirit, and on the other hand we must drink the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eventually, it is rather difficult to say who is in whom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is why Jesus said in John 14:20, At that day the day of resurrection ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the translation of Matthew 28:19, there is a real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The King James Version says, baptizing them in the name.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>So many Christians think that this means to baptize others in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>And as they are baptizing them they say, I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the Greek word for the preposition in is into.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is the same Greek preposition used in Galatians 3:27, where it is properly translated by the King James Version.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is just like the water into which we are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we are baptized into the water, we are put into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>So the real baptism is to put people into the Triune God, with the water as a symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever we baptize others, we should not do it in a formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to exercise our faith that we are putting them into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As they have believed in the Lord Jesus and called on His name, we baptize them into Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not a formality; it is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then after we have been baptized into Him, we must drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all need to drink of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>So eventually we are in Him, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the two Gospels of Matthew and John.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>John concludes with the fact that Jesus gets into us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Matthew ends with the fact that we are put into Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We all have been baptized into Him, and now we all are drinking of Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He is such a wonderful person, yet He is so one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May the Lord remove all the veils from our background and from our concepts that we may see the vision from the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In these two Gospels it is so clear that the main purpose of the gospel is for Christ to be the Bridegroom to obtain His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He is the wonderful Bridegroom, and He is everything to us that we might become His bride as His counterpart for eternity.</S>
