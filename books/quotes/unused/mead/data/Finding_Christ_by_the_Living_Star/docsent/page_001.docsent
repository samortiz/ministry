   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FINDING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE LIVING STAR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first matter presented to us in the entire New Testament is that of Mary conceiving of the Holy Spirit and with the coordination of Joseph bringing forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second matter, or we may say the second case, is that of finding Christ the wise men were guided by the heavenly star to find the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is with this case that we will be occupied in this little booklet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must remember that the first mentioning of any matter in the Bible has tremendous significance: it establishes the principle and sets the course.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we need to consider carefully the account in Matthew 2 of the wise men finding Christ that we too in this present day may be numbered among those who truly find the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE BIBLE A BOOK OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But before we come to the case in point, let me mention a few pertinent things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many of us when we were young attended Christian Sunday Schools and in that setting took the Bible as a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Undoubtedly, there is not such a good story book as the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I can still remember sitting at home and listening to my mother recount the story of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all loved to hear the story of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Sunday Schools and many Christians make the Bible a story book.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are other Christians, however, especially the great teachers and speakers, who make the Bible a book of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For instance, while the Sunday Schools make the Gospel of Matthew a book of stories, the great teachers make it a book of teachings, dispensations, and doctrine concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But what about us?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How do we take the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let me tell you how we must take it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The entire Bible is a book of life; on every page of this book there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we must take it as life and as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You remember, when the Sadducees attempted to debate with the Lord Jesus concerning resurrection, they took a portion of the Old Testament saying, "Master, Moses said, if a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother" Matt 22:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then they proceeded to tell how seven brothers had the same wife and eventually all died.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those foolish Sadducees thought they were clever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They asked the Lord Jesus, "Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus also chose a portion of Scripture and answered, "Have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob will all be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You see, just in the title of God, the Lord Jesus pointed out the life not the story, not the teaching, but the life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let me point out to you as another example the first chapter of the Bible, Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In that chapter we have a story of God's creation but really that is not a story.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Indeed, some great teachers have set forth some doctrines from this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we must forget both the story and the teachings; we must concentrate on the life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Genesis 1, what we need to see is life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same applies to Matthew chapter 1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In that chapter regarding the genealogy and conceiving of Christ we do have a story and a certain amount of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we should not care for the story or the teaching, but the life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some Christians may take the Gospel of John as a book of life, but we must also take the Gospel of Matthew, and in fact every book in the Bible, as life and as the life supply.</S>
