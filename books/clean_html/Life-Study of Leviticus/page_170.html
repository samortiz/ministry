<h2 class=head2>A. The Sacrifice Was to Be Eaten on the Day of the Offering or on the Next Day, but What Remained until the Third Day Was to Be Burned with Fire</h2><p>“It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it, or on the next day; but what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire” (19:6). This signifies that the saints’ fellowship with one another and with God should be kept fresh. Our enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering for our fellowship with God and with one another should be fresh.<h2 class=head2>B. If the Sacrifice Was Eaten at All on the Third Day, It Was an Abhorrent Thing Not Acceptable to God</h2><p>“If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abhorrent thing; it will not be accepted” (19:7). This signifies that the enjoyment of the saints’ stale fellowship with one another and with God is not acceptable but abhorrent to God.<p>We should not have any stale practices at the Lord’s table. We should not come to the Lord’s table with anything stale. Rather, we should come with something new. For this, we need a new repentance, a new confession, a new dealing, and a new touch with the Lord. In other words, we need a new washing, a new bathing in the Word or in the Spirit, so that we can have a fresh remembrance of the Lord. When we have a fresh enjoyment of the Lord. He also will have a fresh enjoyment because of our fresh enjoyment.<h2 class=head2>C. The One Who Ate the Stale Sacrifice Bearing His Iniquity, Having Profaned the Holy Thing of Jehovah, and Being Cut Off from His People</h2><p>“And he who eats it shall bear his iniquity, for he has profaned the holy thing of Jehovah; and that person shall be cut off from his people” (19:8). This signifies that the one who participates in the saints’ stale fellowship is guilty of having despised the holy things of God and will lose the fellowship among God’s people.<h2 class=head1>VI. NO MIXTURE BEING ALLOWED</h2><p>“You shall keep My statutes. You shall not breed your cattle with a different kind; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed; and you shall not put on a garment of two kinds of materials mixed together” (19:19). The fact that no mixture was allowed indicates that God wants everything to be after its kind (cf. Gen. 1:11, 21, 24-25), without any kind of mixture. In the church life we should avoid any kind of mixture.<h2 class=head2>A. Breeding Cattle without Mixture</h2><p>In Leviticus 19 three illustrations of mixture are given. The first illustration is the breeding of cattle without mixture. This signifies that life is not allowed to be mixed; those living by the life of God must not live by the flesh. To live by the life of God on the one hand and by the flesh on the other hand is a mixture. Such mixture is not acceptable to God.<h2 class=head2>B. Sowing Seed without Mixture</h2><p>The second illustration in verse 19 is sowing seed without mixture. This signifies that the ministry of the word is not allowed to be mixed. The word of God that is ministered should not be mixed with the word of the world.
