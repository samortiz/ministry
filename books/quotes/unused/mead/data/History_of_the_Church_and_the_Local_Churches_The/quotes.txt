[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the spring of 1973 in Los Angeles, California.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 20:25-28; 23:8-12; Rom 14:1-3, 5-6, 17; Gal 6:15; Eph 2:15; 4:3, 14, 24
[4]  In this book we want to see how the Lord has moved in the past among His children for the accomplishment of His purpose.
[5]  First, we want to see the history of the church in a general way, and then we want to see the history of the local churches beginning from 1922 editor's note: this history was given by the author in 1973 .
[6]  Because these items invaded the church, some of the faithful, living members of the church were burdened to defend the church, to keep the church away from Judaism, Greek philosophy, and human organization.
[7]  These defenders were devoted Christians who loved the Lord, but they were not so clear about God's goal to gain the church as the corporate Body, the new man, the kingdom, the household, the habitation of God, the bride, and the warrior.
[8]  As we have seen, due to the defending of the truth, different opinions were brought in among the so-called Christians.
[9]  We need to be impressed deeply that the safeguard of our whole Christian walk and the balance of our Christian life is the church.
[10]  If we have seen the church, we will never be divided by anything.
[11]  If we are clear concerning the vision of the church, we will never have hierarchy.
[12]  CHAPTER TWO THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH 2 Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16; Phil 3:5-8; Col 1:18-19; 2:2-3, 6-10; 3:10-11
[13]  I hope that we can take some time to pray-read the verses in the Scripture reading at the beginning of each chapter especially chapters one and two , so that we can be deeply impressed with them.
[14]  We also need to be aware of religion invading the church.
[15]  Paul told us that all these religious factors which had been a gain to him were counted a loss by him on account of Christ v. 7 . He also counted all things to be loss and even refuse that he might gain Christ v. 8 . "Refuse" in verse 8 is dregs, rubbish, filth, what is thrown to the dogs; hence, dog food, dung.
[16]  I want to point out again that the church is completely apart from religion, philosophy, and hierarchy.
[17]  THE NEED FOR A VISION OF GOD'S GOAL THE CHURCH
[18]  All the negative things we have mentioned crept into the church throughout its history.
[19]  We have seen that although Ignatius was such a defender of the truth, he made a mistake because he was short of a clear vision, a complete view, of the church.
[20]  Today's situation is not much different from what happened in the past history of the church.
[21]  Church history shows us that the so-called church in a general sense became degraded and that those who loved the Lord, who loved the truth, and who loved the Bible did not receive a proper, adequate, clear, and complete vision of the church.
[22]  Some young people among us have really been saved and they are members of the church.
[23]  If any saint of the Lord is faithful to all the verses from the Scripture which we are pointing out in this fellowship, he will be in the proper church life.
[24]  The German state church, the Danish state church, the Norwegian state church, the Swedish state church, and the Anglican state church were the issue of the seed sown by Luther.
[25]  One hundred years after the beginning of the Brethren movement, the Lord started something new in mainland China.
[26]  Now I would like to begin relating the history of the local churches, beginning in the early 1920s in China.
[27]  CHAPTER FOUR THE HISTORY OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-7, 19b-20; 4:1-3; 6:3-5, 20-21; 2 Tim 1:15; 2:16-22; 3:5; 4:3-4, 14-15; Titus 1:10-11, 14; 3:10-11
[28]  In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the history of the Lord's recovery among us in the past fifty years.
[29]  In the previous chapter, we shared how Brother Nee was saved and called in the same night.
[30]  Brother Nee came into contact with her soon after his conversion, and he received so much help from her.
[31]  He spent at least several times with me personally to tell me the things concerning his relationship with Miss Barber.
[32]  Initially, Brother Nee was among a group of young brothers and sisters who had just been saved and went to contact Miss Barber.
[33]  Brother Nee was a marvelous reader and an excellent discerner and selector of the things of Christ for the Christian life and the church life.
[34]  He himself told me that in his early days of ministry he gave back one third of his income to the Lord, kept one third for his living, and spent the other third to buy books to read.
[35]  The first year that I went to Shanghai, I stayed with Brother Nee as his guest.
[36]  The first thing the Lord showed us through Brother Nee was the assurance of salvation.
[37]  He declared that the church is an organism, the Body of Christ, and that in another sense, the church is the ekklesia, a Greek word referring to the church as the called-out assembly.
[38]  We learned to serve the Lord in the way of not being hired by anyone, that is, by any mission, organization, or so-called church.
[39]  Along with the revelation concerning the overcomers, Brother Nee saw the truth concerning the kingdom.
[40]  Brother Nee called a conference in Shanghai in January of 1934 to speak concerning the centrality and universality of Christ.
[41]  Along with the vision of the Body of Christ, and the truth concerning the authority of the church, Brother Nee shared concerning coordination for the practicality of the church life.
[42]  I would like to say again that I hope we would pray-read the verses in the Scripture reading.
[43]  When we pray them into us, we will be able to see the proper church life with Christ as our life.
[44]  Brother Nee then left Foochow and went to a place called Pagoda.
[45]  A BRIEF SKETCH OF BROTHER NEE'S WORK Preaching the Gospel to His Classmates
[46]  Now that we have seen the revelations the Lord has given us and the practice of the church life from our history, we want to see the work of Brother Nee.
[47]  Immediately after being saved in 1920, Brother Nee began to work for the Lord.
[48]  In 1926 Brother Nee went to Shanghai to begin the church life there.
[49]  Between 1922 and 1927, Brother Nee was invited to minister in many places in Christianity, but after the church in Shanghai was raised up and became strong, he received only a few invitations.
[50]  From 1927 until Brother Nee went into glory, he was invited only once by the denominations, and that was to a Southern Baptist seminary in my hometown.
[51]  Before his visit to the Brethren, Brother Nee had two conferences.
[52]  In the summer of 1939, Brother Nee returned to China and had a conference on the Body of Christ.
[53]  Due to the exposure of the enemy's subtlety through Brother Nee's messages during those three years, the enemy caused a big turmoil in the church in Shanghai in 1942.
[54]  Eventually, the church there was closed, and Brother Nee's ministry was stopped for six years.
[55]  Some who did not know the real situation, said that Brother Nee was fully occupied with his pharmaceutical business during those six years, but this was absolutely not true.
[56]  CHAPTER SIX THE HISTORY OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES 4 Scripture Reading: Rev 2:2; 6:9b; 2:13-15, 20, 24; 3:2, 9, 15-18, 20; 17:4-6; 18:4 THE SPIRITUAL LESSONS LEARNED BY BROTHER NEE
[57]  In my initial years in the work with him, especially in November and December of 1933 and January and February of 1934, he had many personal times with me to tell me many things concerning church history, his history, and the history of the Lord's work in China.
[58]  Then a young man named Watchman Nee rose up to expose the error of denominationalism.
[59]  He declared that the denominational churches were wrong and that there should only be the church in a locality.
[60]  Brother Nee said that he appreciated the missionaries bringing the Bible, the name of Christ, and the gospel to China, but he also said that they should not have come to build up their mission churches.
[61]  Although there was so much opposition to Brother Nee within Christianity, there was also some vindication from the Lord.
[62]  In 1938 and 1939 he was in England, and he was invited to the Keswick convention, a gathering of Christians who were very much for the inner life.
[63]  Brother Nee was hesitant about giving such a public prayer, but Brother T. Austin-Sparks, who had brought him to the convention, encouraged him to do it.
[64]  In the previous chapter, we saw the lessons which Brother Nee learned through his sufferings.
[65]  From the beginning of the church life in mainland China, there was a sister who was dissenting toward Brother Nee.
[66]  I would like to relate something that happened with this brother to show you how Brother Nee suffered.
[67]  One day a learned man was saved among us, and he desired to be baptized before he left China for the United States.
[68]  Brother Nee was so clear about this newly saved one, and he agreed that this man should be baptized before he left China.
[69]  Brother Nee had shared previously in some messages that in the church life we always need the fellowship and that we should not do things individualistically.
[70]  Brother Nee also suffered from those who were ambitious for position.
[71]  Brother Nee also suffered attacks from rebellious ones who were among us.
[72]  Brother Nee suffered not only the attacks from the outsiders but also the attacks and rebellion from those inside the church life.
[73]  When this rebellious brother was in Hong Kong, he sent Brother Nee materials concerning communism so that the Japanese military would think Brother Nee was a communist and arrest him.
[74]  I would like to relate one more complicated case which caused Brother Nee to suffer greatly.
[75]  On the Lord's Day after the Lord's table, I received a designated gift of two dollars that had been placed in the offering box.
[76]  Brother Nee was wise to flee and escape from Shanghai.
[77]  Brother Samuel Chang was a great help to Brother Nee in that pharmaceutical factory.
[78]  Due to the great turmoil in the church in Shanghai, Brother Nee had no other choice but to stop his ministry.
[79]  He told these saints that regardless of whether the church was against him or for him, it was still the church, and they had to continue in the church.
[80]  In the previous two chapters, we saw the sufferings of Brother Nee and the spiritual lessons he learned through them.
[81]  Now that we have seen something concerning the revelations Brother Nee received from the Lord and his sufferings, we want to see something concerning his ministry.
[82]  Brother Nee's ministry was clearly of two aspects Christ and the church.
[83]  I never saw a person like Brother Nee who was so adequately and thoroughly balanced with these two aspects Christ and the church.
[84]  Twenty years later I was invited to the same place by Brother Austin-Sparks.
[85]  As I walked down from the platform by myself, one of the elders there came to me and said that Brother Nee's ministry concerning the church and its practicality had been rejected there twenty years ago.
[86]  Eventually, I was sent from mainland China to Taiwan, and we started the work there in 1949.
[87]  I told the brothers that in a recent issue of Brother Austin-Sparks' paper, The Witness and the Testimony, there was a small paragraph written by him in which he expressed his thanks to the people who sent him Christmas cards.
[88]  I say again that Brother Nee's ministry in the aspect of Christ was fully accepted, but his ministry in the aspect of the church was fully rejected.
[89]  Eventually, a false rumor of two aspects was being spread.
[90]  The first aspect was that Brother Nee changed his concept about the practicality of the church, the ground of the church, after the Second World War.
[91]  The second aspect was that because Witness Lee is so much for the practicality of the church life, he is different from Watchman Nee.
[92]  This proves that after the war, Brother Nee did not change his concept about the practice of the church.
[93]  In these messages Brother Nee confirmed that what he had seen in 1937 concerning the practicality of the church life was absolutely right.
[94]  It is absolutely dishonest to give people a wrong impression that Brother Nee was only for the revelation and experience of Christ and not for the church life.
[95]  I am happy to see Brother Nee's books on Christ as life published, but it is the enemy's subtlety that the books by Brother Nee on the practicality of the church life would be hidden.
[96]  CHAPTER NINE THE HISTORY OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES 7 Scripture Reading: Gal 1:4, 13-16; 5:11; Rev 2:6, 9, 14-15, 20, 24; 3:7-9, 20; 17:4-5; 18:4 THE REVELATIONS, THE SUFFERINGS,
[97]  Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us out of the present evil age according to the will of God.
[98]  Paul continues his thought about this evil age in Galatians 1:13 and 14 by telling us how he was in that age: "For you have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it; and I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers."
[99]  One of the most damaging items in Christianity is the clergy-laity system.
[100]  In Revelation 2:6 the Lord said, "But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
[101]  Thank the Lord that Brother Nee was a pioneer ahead of us to come out of Christianity into the pure church life to accomplish God's will to have the Body of Christ.
[102]  Now I would like to share something concerning the four main revivals among us.
[103]  By January 1, 1943 the revival in Chefoo was at its peak.
[104]  The Biggest, Most Powerful, and Most Prevailing Revival among Us through the Recovery
[105]  Thank the Lord that through the revival in 1947 the whole church in Shanghai was brought back, and eventually Brother Nee's ministry was recovered.
[106]  I hope that we would be so clear about these four aspects: the assurance of salvation, the overcoming life of Christ, the practicality of the church life, and the full surrender of whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we can do, to the church.
[107]  At this point I would like to fellowship about my realization of Brother Nee through my contact with him.
[108]  Brother Nee and I were far away from one another when we were young Christians.
[109]  Later this young brother was being transferred by his company from Chefoo to Shanghai.
[110]  He asked me where he should meet in Shanghai.
[111]  I told him that the booklet I had given him on the assurance of salvation had something in it concerning where a meeting of Christians was.
[112]  On the evening of the day that Brother Nee left, a brother who was a member of my former denomination came to me.
[113]  CHAPTER TEN THE HISTORY OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES 8 Scripture Reading: John 17:21; Rom 16:17; 1 Cor 1:10, 12-13a; Titus 3:10; Eph 2:22; 4:16; 1 Pet 2:5; Rev 1:11-12; 2:7; 22:17a
[114]  We have to realize that our history is not that of an organization or of a movement.
[115]  Although I had contact with Brother Nee's ministry in 1925, I did not come into the Lord's recovery in a full way until 1932.
[116]  Since that time I have seen the recovery passing through a process of coming out of Christendom.
[117]  In the previous chapter, I shared that I was called by the Lord to serve Him in a full way on the day that I was saved.
[118]  Brother Nee also helped me by sharing with me about the first twelve years of the history of the Lord's recovery in China.
[119]  Later, Brother Nee made arrangements for me to edit The Christian, a magazine for young believers, whereas he would edit The Present Testimony, a deeper magazine on the spiritual principles of life.
[120]  In 1934, after I had been in Shanghai close to four months, Brother Nee said to me, "Witness, we co-workers feel that you have to move your family to Shanghai so that we can work together.
[121]  At that time my family was still in northern China, so I had to return.
[122]  Thus, Brother Nee and I were separated for a time.
[123]  In November 1948, Brother Nee had an urgent conference with us, the co-workers around him in Shanghai, to fellowship concerning the work.
[124]  At the beginning of that conference, he said that he and the other co-workers had to ask me, Brother Lee, to go out of the country, and that all needed to bring this matter to the Lord and see how the Lord would lead each one of them.
[125]  By February 1949, Brother Nee had a second conference with the co-workers to decide that I, Brother Lee, had to go out of the country and that he and the other co-workers should stay.
