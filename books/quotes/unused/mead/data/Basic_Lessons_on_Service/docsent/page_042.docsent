   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this lesson we want to continue our fellowship concerning presenting Christ as the peace offering to the Father in the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In particular we want to see the significance of the portions of the peace offering as seen in Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>D. The Portions</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>of the Peace Offering 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To God a. From the Ox</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A portion of the peace offering is presented to God from the ox Lev 3:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This portion is the fat upon the inwards, the inner parts, of the cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the fat upon all the inwards must be for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The two kidneys and the fat on them is for God, as well as the caul net above the liver.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All this fat and these tender parts within the cattle must be burned to God as His food to satisfy Him and to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These items refer to the sweetness and the tenderness of the inward being of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The inward being of Christ can be appreciated only by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not have that much ability in our apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our apprehension we cannot perceive that deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only God has such an appreciating ability.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Matthew 11:27 the Lord Jesus said that "no one fully knows the Son except the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When He said this, a number of people, including the disciples, were around Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They saw Him, but they could not perceive what was within His inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No human being can fully perceive what is in the Lord's inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only God can fully evaluate it, appreciate it, enjoy it, and apprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Leviticus does not say that the heart is offered to God for His portion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, it emphatically mentions the kidneys and the liver when speaking of the portions of the peace offering which are God's portion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no fat around the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there were, that would be terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, the heart is a vitally crucial organ, but the liver and kidneys are very tender and very sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a picture of what is within Christ which is invisible, or unseen, to human eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only God can perceive what is there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fat always indicates sweetness and tenderness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The softest, sweetest, and most tender part in the cattle is the fat, which becomes food to God through burning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The best part of the cattle for burning is the fat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would be against the "medical law" for the priests to eat the fat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is altogether unhealthy for us humans to eat fat, but it is altogether healthy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot digest the fat, but God can.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fat gives us trouble, but fat does not give any trouble to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The divine digestion is different from our human digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows us how marvelous the Bible is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They did not have the benefit of modern science in the days of the Old Testament, but God established a dietary ordinance for the priests according to His medical law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Modern science, of course, has discovered that fat is not good for the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in the Bible, this principle was there already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God kept all the fat away from the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many of the Chinese eat all the fat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They treasure the fat and give it to the people whom they respect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the Jews in the Old Testament offered all the fat to God, and God could digest it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because many of the Chinese do not know God, they give the wrong thing to the wrong persons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the Jews in the Old Testament knew God according to the Scriptures, so they offered the right thing to the right person, that is, God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fat of the cattle must go to God.</S>
