   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Going by a Team</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we go to preach the gospel, we should go in teams of three.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After many years of experience and study of the Bible, we have found that this is the most economical and effective way for gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must first be stirred up and then pick up another two saints to form a team to go to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need to wait for the elders to announce a prayer meeting to pray for this or to prepare a register with names and regulations for the teams.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should forget all this and just go!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then maybe the elders and others will follow us to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not try to "unify" the church into the practice of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From 1949 through 1955 in the church in Taipei, the gospel atmosphere was quite high, but still the entire church was not "unified" into the practice of the gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In going out as a team, it is best that there are both brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is best to have at least one brother for baptizing the believers, and it is best to have at least one sister so that if a female is baptized, the sister can take care of her.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A team of three, with two brothers and one sister or one brother and two sisters, would be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our experimenting and testing in Taipei has shown that this way will produce results.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to go in the trained way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I may go to play the piano for two years, yet without being trained I will still not know how to play the piano well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to preach the gospel effectively, we must pray and endeavor to learn the secret of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Getting Ourselves Prepared</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To prepare ourselves to preach the gospel, we first must consecrate ourselves, give ourselves, to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must tell the Lord: "Lord, I was saved by You.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I belong to You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You redeemed me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You purchased me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You bought me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am Your property.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am Your asset.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I belong to You, so now I give You Your full rights.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am here."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we must pray and prepare ourselves to use some material in order to preach the gospel to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may want to use some Bible verses, but still we need training in order to be able to talk with someone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may prefer to use The Mystery of Human Life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not simple to use this booklet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to get ourselves into it until we can nearly recite every paragraph and every section.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can practice at home with the members of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thirty-eight thousand were brought to the Lord through the use of The Mystery of Human Life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to give ourselves to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we humble ourselves, we can be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We even have to learn how to knock on a door.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that our knocking must sound "sweet."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the people within open the door, the first sentence out of our mouth should cause them to open the door wide, and the second sentence should open their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our wrong attitude or tone of voice may cause them to close the door.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can practice knocking on doors at home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A husband can knock on his wife's door, and let his wife criticize him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not too much for us to practice like this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a young girl is learning to play the piano, she sits for hours at the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She is always being adjusted by her teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Her teacher is always showing her how to hold her fingers, how to sit at the piano, etc. Otherwise, she cannot learn to play the piano well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way, we must give ourselves to be trained in how to talk with people and how to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must learn when to bring them to the Lord and what words to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must exercise and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We even have to learn how to be coached by our companions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that we must learn to be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we practice, we will improve week by week.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to consider whether people would be caught by our way of talking to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to study and be patient, always learning and always trying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should never be disappointed or discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, we should always exercise to be encouraged.</S>
