To Accomplish His All-inclusive Judicial Redemption</H2><P>In His full ministry in the first stage of His incarnation, Christ accomplished four great things. First, He brought the infinite God into the finite man; second, He united and mingled the Triune God with the tripartite man; third, He expressed the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues; and fourth, eventually, He accomplished His all-inclusive judicial redemption. The first two things were concerning His birth, the third thing was concerning His human living, and the fourth thing was concerning His death. After He passed through His human living, He went to die on the cross for the accomplishment of His all-inclusive judicial redemption.</P><P>The all-inclusive judicial redemption of Christ is of five aspects. First, He terminated all things of the old creation. Second, He redeemed all the things created by God and fallen in sin (Heb. 2:9; Col. 1:20). Everything belonging to the old creation was terminated by Christ through His death. After this termination, He redeemed back all the things created by God and fallen in sin. Third, He created (conceived) the new man with His divine element. Ephesians 2:15 says that on the cross He created the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers in Himself into one new man. That creation was a conception. Any conception requires an element; without the element, there cannot be a conception. Christ created (conceived) the new man in Himself, indicating that He was the very element for the conceiving of the new man. He conceived in Himself as the element the two peoples into one new man. While the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, He was creating the new man.</P><P>Fourth, when Christ accomplished His all-inclusive judicial redemption, He released His divine life from the shell of His humanity. John 12:24 says that the Lord Jesus was a grain of wheat. Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, its outer shell cannot be broken and its life within cannot be released. Christ had the divine life, but it was concealed in the shell of His humanity. Hence, He needed to suffer death on the cross that the shell of His humanity might be broken to release His divine life from His human shell.</P><P>Fifth, in accomplishing His all-inclusive judicial death, Christ also laid a foundation for His organic salvation and set up the procedure to attain His ministry in the stage of His inclusion. Christ's judicial redemption is the foundation of His organic salvation. Christ in His full ministry in the second stage of His inclusion requires a procedure, and His judicial redemption is such a procedure to accomplish His ministry in the stage of His inclusion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO ENTER INTO, TO SPEAK, AND TO EXPERIENCE</H2><P>Concerning all the crucial points mentioned above, we need to learn them in a thorough and penetrating way and spend time to study them with much endeavoring.
