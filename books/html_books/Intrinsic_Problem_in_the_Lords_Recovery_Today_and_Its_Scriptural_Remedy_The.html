<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book was compiled from messages given in the elders&rsquo; meetings held in Anaheim, California on March 9-10, 1990, and includes some additional points.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GENUINE ONENESS OF THE BODY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 17:2, 6, 11, 14-21, 22-24; Eph. 4:1-6, 11-16</h1>
<p>Prayer: Thank You, Father, that we have Your name. Your name is the source of life. We have Your life, and now we have Your word. Thank You that You are the source of the oneness. You are also the element of the oneness. Now we do have the sanctifying word. It sanctifies us all the time to make us all one in You.</p>
<p>Lord, we do praise You. The Father has loved You and has given You all His glory. And You love us. Oh, how much You love the church! You have given us the Father&rsquo;s name, the Father&rsquo;s life, and the Father&rsquo;s glory, and You have given us the sanctifying holy word. Lord Jesus, we worship You for all this. Tonight, bring us into all the reality of the name of the Father, of the divine life, and of the glory of the Triune God with the sanctifying word that we might be really one.</p>
<p>Lord, how we praise You that there is oneness among the Triune God. We worship this oneness of the Divine Trinity. Oh, what a wonder and what a blessing that the Father loves You, and You love us, and now in turn we love You! Lord Jesus, thank You that there is such a divine love, a mutual love, from the Father to You, from You to us, and now from us to You. We love each other, and we love each other in the Triune God. Thank You, Lord, for the divine name, for the divine life, for the divine word, for the divine glory, and even for the divine love. We do love You; we love You with Your love. We are in Your love. Thank You, Lord Jesus. Here we have the oneness, the oneness of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, that You are still giving. You are the loving Giver, the rich Giver. The Father has given us to You, and You have given to us the Father&rsquo;s name, the Father&rsquo;s word, and even the Father&rsquo;s glory. We are just the receivers. We desire also to be the givers, to give You to one another.</p>
<p>Lord, we do thank You for this occasion. We believe this is a gathering conducted by You. You have gathered us out of so many occupations into Your name. Do bless this gathering. Lord, we pray for these meetings. Release all Your riches. Do release Yourself by releasing us. Release us in Your Spirit, in Your anointing, in Your presence. We desire to have the fellowship and this release, Lord, that we may release You. O Lord Jesus, we enjoy You. We enjoy Your essence, we enjoy Your element, we enjoy Your presence, and we even enjoy Your countenance; we see You face to face. Lord, we pray that in all these meetings You will touch us. We desire to be touched by You, and we also desire to touch You. Touch us, Lord, and cause us to touch You. Lord, we ask You to feel free to move among us. Feel free to do everything that is on Your heart. We desire to see, to know, and to realize what is on Your heart. We want to see Your pleasure, Your heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>For Your sake, Lord, You must rebuke the enemy. He is Your enemy and ours. We hate him. We accuse him before Your throne. Lord, do rebuke him and condemn him. Rebuke him away from Your presence. Rebuke him away from the very oneness of Your Body, away from all the local churches. Lord, even crush him under our feet. Lord, do Your recovery work. Recover all that has been lost.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PROMISE TO CRUSH SATAN<br />
UNDER THE FEET OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h2>
<p>As we were praying, I was reminded that the book of Romans consummates with the local churches (16:1, 4-5, 16, 23). In the last chapter of that book, there is a promise from God to the local churches, that is, that God will crush Satan under the feet of the local churches (v. 20). We need to stand on this promise and believe that our God, the God of peace, will surely crush Satan under our feet. We claim the fulfillment of this promise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INTRINSIC PROBLEM<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY TODAY</h2>
<p>The subject in these elders&rsquo; meetings is the intrinsic problem in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today and its scriptural remedy. We cannot deny that there is still a problem in the recovery today. The intrinsic nature of this problem is quite hidden; it is an intrinsic problem. To face such an intrinsic problem, we need a clear vision of the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ, which is unveiled in the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17. As we are trying to find the scriptural remedy for this problem, I have a burden to point out to you this genuine oneness, which the Lord prayed for before He went to die and resurrect for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. I believe that this is the excelling way to obtain the needed remedy.</p>
<p>According to my observation, the problem among us came in because of the shortage of the proper understanding of the genuine oneness. The oneness to which I am referring is the genuine oneness, not the oneness that many Christians talk about so lightly. My burden in this message is to fellowship with you concerning the genuine oneness of the Body.</p>
<p>First, the New Testament shows us that what the Lord desires in His Body is oneness. Then, when the church came into being, there was the need of the practice of this oneness. The practice of the genuine oneness is the one accord. The New Testament reveals that as the churches were practicing the genuine oneness in the one accord, many negative things came in to test the oneness. These tests of the genuine oneness can be seen from the book of Acts, the beginning of the New Testament record concerning the church, to the book of Revelation, the end of the record of the church life in the New Testament. By considering the problems in the early church, we can find some examples that will help us to find a remedy for our present situation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY BEING THE GENUINE ONENESS</h2>
<p>One of the most positive items in the New Testament revelation is the genuine oneness of the Body. This genuine oneness is just the processed Triune God, who mingles Himself with us, the redeemed and transformed Christians. The genuine oneness of the Body is nothing less than the Triune God, who is not only triune but also processed and consummated. This consummated, processed Triune God mingles Himself with His chosen people in their humanity, and this mingling is the genuine oneness.</p>
<p>The genuine oneness is not merely a matter of our meeting together. The worldly people meet together, and in their gatherings they have their kind of oneness. However, that is not our oneness. Our oneness is the oneness of the organic Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is a mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed and transformed people. Because it is such a mingling, the Body itself is the oneness. The Three of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are three divine factors of this oneness, and these three divine factors are mingled with one human factor, consummating in the Body. This Body is the genuine oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS OF THE LORD&rsquo;S<br />
ASPIRATION AND PRAYER</h2>
<p>First, this oneness was something in the Lord&rsquo;s desire. This desire of the Lord&rsquo;s became His aspiration, and this aspiration was expressed in the prayer offered by the Lord in John 17 (vv. 2, 6, 11, 14-24). The subject of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17 is oneness. The Lord uttered this prayer out of the divine aspiration. At that time this oneness was not yet a reality; however, a model of this oneness&mdash;the oneness among the Three of the Divine Trinity&mdash;was there. The Father and the Son are one (vv. 11, 21), and this oneness implies or includes the Spirit. In John 17 the Lord used the plural pronouns <em>We</em> (v. 11) and <em>Us</em> (v. 21) to signify the Triune God. The Triune God is one, and that oneness is a model of the oneness of the Body of Christ. Because the oneness of the Body has the oneness among the Three of the Trinity as a model, John 17 tells us that this oneness is altogether wrapped up with the Triune God (v. 21). The oneness of the Body of Christ is just the enlarged oneness of the Divine Trinity. The model was there at the time the Lord prayed, but the enlargement was still to come. This enlarged oneness came on the day of Pentecost. Through the outpouring of the Spirit, the Body of Christ was produced (1 Cor. 12:13). That Body is the solid oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br />
in the Father&rsquo;s Name by His Divine Life</h2>
<h2 class="head3">In the Father&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>The oneness of the Body is the oneness of all the believers in Christ in the Father&rsquo;s name (John 17:2, 6, 11). To be in the Father&rsquo;s name is to be in the Father&rsquo;s person, for in the New Testament, the name always denotes the person. Thus, to be in the Father&rsquo;s name is to be in the Father Himself. In the sense of the New Testament, the Father always bears the denotation of the source of life. The father of a family is the source of the life of that family. In John 17:11 the Lord prayed that the believers would be one in the name of the Father. To be one in the Father&rsquo;s name is to be one in the very source of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">By the Father&rsquo;s Divine Life</h2>
<p>This oneness is also by the Father&rsquo;s divine life and with the Father&rsquo;s divine nature. Since we have the Father&rsquo;s life, we also have the Father&rsquo;s nature, for the nature always goes along with the life. We have the Father&rsquo;s person as the source of the genuine oneness, and we have the Father&rsquo;s divine life with His divine nature as the very element of this oneness. These are the intrinsic contents of the oneness of the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br />
in the Triune God through Sanctification<br />
by the Reality of the Word</h2>
<p>The oneness of all the believers in Christ is in the Triune God through sanctification by the reality of the word (John 17:14-21). In the portion of His prayer in verses 14-21, the Lord referred to the word and to the truth. The word sanctifies, and the truth sanctifies. Thus, the word and the truth are one. The word contains and bears the truth. This word, which is the truth, sanctifies God&rsquo;s redeemed people from the world (v. 17) and keeps them from the ruler of the world, the evil one (v. 15).</p>
<h2 class="head3">In the Triune God</h2>
<p>In John 17:21 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.&rdquo; The word <em>Us</em> here refers to the Triune God. This shows that the oneness of the believers is in the Triune God, which means that the believers are mingled with the processed Triune God. The believers could not be one without being mingled with the Triune God. Hence, the Triune God is the very base and element of our oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Through Sanctification<br />
by the Reality of the Word</h2>
<p>Before being saved, we were in the world and were mixed with the world. To be in the Triune God as our oneness, we need to be sanctified, that is, we need to be separated from being mixed with the world. If we would practice the genuine oneness, we must realize that the world must go. We cannot be mingled with the Triune God and at the same time remain in a mixture with the world. Therefore, we must be separated from being mixed with the world, so that we can be holy unto the Triune God to have a pure mingling with Him. This pure mingling is the oneness. If we desire to realize the genuine oneness, we must be separated from the mixing world unto the sanctifying God through the reality of His sanctifying word.</p>
<p>In addition to being separated from the world, we need to be kept from the evil one (v. 15). When we were mixed with the world, we were captured by the evil one. Thus, we need to be sanctified from the world and to be kept from the evil one unto the Triune God. Then we will be freed and purified to be mingled with the Triune God, that is, to practice the genuine oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Through the Reality of the Word</h2>
<p>The oneness of all the believers in Christ is through the reality of the word, that is, through the reality of the processed Triune God conveyed in His sanctifying word (John 17:17). Without the Triune God as the content, the word would be empty. The New Testament shows us clearly that the truth, the word, and the Triune God are one. The word is the truth (v. 17), and the truth is the Triune God (John 14:6; 1 John 5:6b). Hence, the word that is the reality contains the Triune God as its content. To be sanctified by the reality of the word is to be sanctified by the Triune God Himself. The Triune God is the very content of the sanctification. By this we can realize what the nature of this genuine oneness is.</p>
<p>The genuine oneness, which is the mingling of the Triune God with the redeemed humanity, has three aspects. The first aspect is the oneness in the Father&rsquo;s name by His divine life, and the second is the oneness in the Triune God by His sanctifying word. The first aspect concerns the source and the element of the oneness, and the second concerns the standing of the oneness. If we are in the world and under Satan&rsquo;s hand, we cannot practice the oneness. To practice the oneness, we must be separated from the world and kept away from Satan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness of All the Believers in Christ<br />
in the Divine Glory for the Expression<br />
of the Processed and Mingled Triune God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">In the Divine Glory</h2>
<p>The third aspect of the genuine oneness is the oneness of the believers in Christ in the divine glory (John 17:22-24). After many years of studying the New Testament, we have found out that God&rsquo;s glory is His divine life with His divine nature to express Him. If we did not have the Father&rsquo;s life with the Father&rsquo;s nature, it would be impossible for us to express the Father. The expression of the Father comes from the Father&rsquo;s life with the Father&rsquo;s nature. This expression of the Father is the glory.</p>
<p>First, the Father gave this glory to the Son that the Son may have the Father&rsquo;s life with the Father&rsquo;s nature to express the Father. Then the Son gave the same glory to His believers. This means that the Son has given the divine life with the divine nature to His believers that they may express God. It is in this expression that we are one. The oneness of all the believers in the divine glory is the oneness in the expressed sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and nature. If we live by our life with our nature to express ourselves, there will be no glory of God. In the expression of ourselves there is no oneness; rather, there is division.</p>
<p>In the second aspect of oneness, we must be sanctified from the world and kept from Satan. In the third aspect, we must be saved from ourself, we must lose ourself. We must not act or do anything to express ourself; rather, we must do things in the Father&rsquo;s life with the Father&rsquo;s nature to express the Father. This is glory, and it is in this glory that we all are one.</p>
<p>Even in a small town where only fifteen saints are meeting as the church, if these fifteen do not behave, act, and do things in the divine life with the divine nature to express God, they will have opinions and will surely be divided. However, if they would be willing to be saved from themselves, willing not to live in their natural life with their own nature to express themselves, but to live the divine life with the divine nature to carry out the divine expression, spontaneously, among those fifteen there would be a genuine oneness, and this oneness would swallow up all their opinions.</p>
<h2 class="head3">For the Expression of the Processed<br />
and Mingled Triune God</h2>
<p>This oneness is to express in His fullness the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God, who has mingled Himself with the believers in their humanity. The oneness in the divine glory is to express the whole and entire incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God in all His fullness, that is, in all His riches. This rich God has mingled Himself with the human believers for His corporate, all-inclusive expression. Such an expression is a mingling of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God with all His redeemed in their humanity. This is to be one in the glory of the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The first kind of oneness revealed in the New Testament is the oneness of the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer. The model for the genuine oneness was there at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer, but the actual oneness had not yet come. On the day of Pentecost, the actual oneness came. At that time the oneness of the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer became the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:1-6). This matter touches the depths of the holy Word. The Spirit is the very consummated Triune God. When we have the Spirit, we have the totality of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and this consummation is now one with the saved ones. This is the enlarged oneness in actuality, but still not in practicality. To have something in actuality means that it exists, that it is a fact; whereas to have something in practicality means that such a thing has become our practice, our experience. Hence, in the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, we have only the actuality of the oneness; we do not yet have the practicality. First, this oneness was in Christ&rsquo;s aspiration, and it became His prayer. Then this oneness became the oneness of the Spirit, which is the oneness in actuality, the oneness in fact.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the Triune God mingled Himself with His redeemed people, and this mingling became the actuality of the oneness. In John 17 this oneness was there among the Divine Trinity only as a model; it had not yet been enlarged. But on the day of Pentecost, the Triune God, after being processed and consummated, was poured out as the Spirit; that is, the processed and consummated Triune God mingled Himself with His chosen and redeemed people. This mingling is the actual oneness, and this actual oneness is the enlargement of the model of the oneness of the Divine Trinity. In John 17 the oneness was an aspiration in Christ which Christ uttered into a prayer. On the day of Pentecost, the oneness that had been in Christ&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer came into being. This is the oneness of the Spirit, which is fully defined by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians chapter four. In verse 3 Paul said that we all must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. Then, in the subsequent verses he gave a definition of the oneness of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">This Oneness in Actuality<br />
Being Composed of Four Factors<br />
by Two Means with One Goal</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Composed of Four Factors</h2>
<p>This oneness is composed of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God as its four factors (vv. 4-6). These four factors are four persons&mdash;the Body, the Spirit, the Lord, and God. The Body as the object is mingled with the Divine Trinity as the elements to be the factors of the oneness of the Spirit. The three factors&mdash;the Spirit, the Lord (the Son), and the one God (the Father)&mdash;are the elements of the oneness of the Spirit. These three elements are mingled with the Body, producing a fourth factor. The mingling of these four factors is the oneness of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">By One Faith and One Baptism<br />
as the Two Means</h2>
<p>The one faith and the one baptism mentioned in verse 5 are the two means to accomplish this oneness. Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ the Head, and baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam, the old head. Baptism separates us from Adam, and faith joins us to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">With One Hope as the One Goal</h2>
<p>The oneness of the Spirit has the one hope of our calling, mentioned in verse 4, as the one goal. This goal is for the Body to be brought into the divine glory of the processed Triune God, who is mingled with the Body. Thus, in the oneness of the Spirit, there are four factors, two means, and one goal. The genuine oneness is the Spirit, the Son, and the Father mingled with the Body through baptism and faith, with a hope of something to come. This is the oneness. Anything besides these seven items is a foreign article that divides the Body.</p><h2 class="head3">Making the Body an Object<br />
of Seven Attributes of Oneness</h2>
<p>The one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope make the Body one in every aspect as its attributes. The four factors of which the Body is composed, the two means by which the Body is separated from Adam and joined to Christ, and the one hope that is the glorious goal of the Body are the Body&rsquo;s attributes, which make the Body one in every aspect. The Body is altogether a matter of oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness to Accomplish the Aspiration<br />
and Prayer of the Lord</h2>
<p>This oneness of the above three attributes accomplishes the aspiration and prayer of the Lord. However, it is not yet the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness Possessed<br />
by All the Believers in Christ,<br />
Who Have Received the Spirit as the Seal<br />
of God&rsquo;s Possession (the Church) and the Pledge<br />
 of Our Inheritance (the Triune God)</h2>
<p>This oneness is possessed by all the believers in Christ, who have received the Spirit as the seal of God&rsquo;s possession, which is the church, and the pledge of our inheritance, which is the Triune God (Eph. 1:13-14). Because we have received such a Spirit as the consummated God, we have the oneness. We all possess this oneness; this oneness is our possession. However, we need to experience it. To possess the oneness is to have the actuality of the oneness. When we experience this oneness, the actuality becomes our practicality; the actual oneness becomes our practical oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness to Be Kept Diligently<br />
by All the Believers</h2>
<p>First, we possess this oneness, and then we should keep it. This oneness must be kept diligently by all the believers in Christ with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love in the uniting bond of peace, that we may walk worthily of the calling with which we were called (Eph. 4:1-3). We keep the oneness by practicing the oneness, first diligently, then with all lowliness, all meekness, and all longsuffering. Then we need to bear one another in the divine love and in the uniting bond of the divine peace. In this way we practice the possessed oneness and thus keep it to have a walk that is worthy of the calling with which God has called us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS PARTLY OF THE FAITH<br />
AND PARTLY OF THE FULL KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF THE SON OF GOD</h2>
<p>When we keep this oneness, it will become the third kind of oneness, that is, the oneness partly of the faith and partly of the full knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:11-16). The faith mentioned in Ephesians 4:13 is the objective faith, denoting all the things in which we believe for our salvation. The faith equals the apostles&rsquo; teaching, which is the teaching of the entire New Testament. The faith in which we believe is the contents of the entire New Testament. The three main things in the New Testament are God Himself, the person of Christ, and the work of Christ. We believe in what God is, we believe in what Christ is, and we believe in what Christ has done. This is our faith.</p>
<p>If we do not believe in any one of these main aspects of the New Testament teaching, we are divisive. Some so-called Christians say that they believe that Christ is the Savior, but they do not believe that Christ is God. They believe that Christ loved them and died for them, but they do not believe that He is God. We might mistakenly think that because they believe in Christ, these people are Christians. The Mormons and the modernists are such persons who do not believe that Christ is God. Because of this, they are divided from us.</p>
<p>This oneness is also the oneness partly of the full knowledge of the Son of God. We may know Christ, but we may not know Christ in full. The Christ whom we know may be very narrow. We need to have the full knowledge of Christ, that is, to know Christ in full. Then the Christ whom we know will be the enlarged Christ, the expanded Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Oneness to Which All the Believers<br />
in Christ Need to Go On and at Which<br />
All the Believers Need to Arrive</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ need to go on until they all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:13a). When we say that Christ is all-inclusive, we mean that He is not only the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;but also the Man; that within Him is His marvelous death and His powerful resurrection; and that He is all that we need&mdash;salvation, peace, hope, our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, and our spiritual home. Some people argue with us and try to discourage us from speaking in such a way. Because I teach that Christ is our food (John 6:57), our drink (John 7:37-39), our clothing (Gal. 3:27), and our dwelling place (John 15:4a), some have misunderstood my teaching concerning the all-inclusiveness of Christ and have even accused me of teaching pantheism. They believe in their kind of Christ, and I believe in Christ according to the full revelation of the Bible. Because of such differences in the knowing of Christ, there is a lack of oneness. Thus, there is the need for us to go on to arrive at the full knowledge of the Son of God.</p>
<p>Christians disagree and argue over many small matters. For example, some argue over whether a person should be baptized by sprinkling or by immersion, and others have disagreed over the number of times and in what direction, forward or backward, a person should be immersed. Disputing over small matters such as these causes division. Those who are preoccupied with such things may be genuine believers, but they have not arrived at the oneness of the proper faith or at the full knowledge of Christ. They are like small children who are preoccupied with certain toys. Therefore, we all need to advance; we all need to grow. The more we advance in the growth of life, the more we will drop all the &ldquo;toys,&rdquo; and the more we will arrive at the genuine oneness in practicality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness That Needs<br />
the Full Growth of the New Man<br />
and the Measure of the Stature<br />
of the Fullness (the Body) of Christ</h2>
<p>This oneness in practicality needs the full growth of the new man and needs also the measure of the stature of the fullness (the Body) of Christ (Eph. 4:13c). This means that we need to grow. A child who is only four feet tall is not full-grown; he needs to grow further until he arrives at the measure of six feet, the measure of the stature of a full-grown man. In a similar way, we need to grow in the divine life until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness, the Body, of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">No Longer Babes Tossed by Waves and<br />
Carried About by Every Wind of Teaching<br />
in the Sleight of Men, in Craftiness<br />
with a View to a System of Error</h2>
<p>When we are full-grown, that is, mature, we will no longer be babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error (Eph. 4:14). The problems among us today are due to the immaturity of many of the saints. A number of saints have been damaged by the negative speaking of the divisive ones because they lack the full growth, which means that they are short of the adequate knowledge of Christ and the proper understanding of the faith. Because of this they listened to and believed the negative talk.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:14 speaks of the winds of teaching. Every wind of teaching comes in the sleight of men, that is, in a cheating way, and in craftiness. In this verse <em>sleight</em> and <em>craftiness</em> are used in apposition, meaning that they refer to the same thing. Sleight implies cheating, and craftiness implies deceiving. To deceive people is to cheat them. The winds of teaching in sleight and in craftiness are related to the system of error. The word <em>system</em> indicates that the system of error must be of Satan; it must be a satanic system of error designed to systematize people into a division. The winds of teaching may have the appearance of truth, but in such teaching the truth may be applied for the purpose of causing division. Anything that divides the believers is a wind of teaching.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:12, some of the Corinthian believers said, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; some said, &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; and some said, &ldquo;I am of Cephas.&rdquo; Surely we all would condemn this kind of speaking as divisive. However, some of the Corinthians said, &ldquo;I am of Christ.&rdquo; This does not seem to be divisive; rather, it seems very spiritual. Nevertheless, even such a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; saying was divisive; it was a wind of teaching. We all must be of Christ, but to say that we are of Christ so as to designate ourselves as different from other believers is divisive. To designate ourselves by saying either &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Cephas,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Christ&rdquo; is divisive. To say &ldquo;I am of Christ,&rdquo; in itself, may be right, but as long as it is divisive, it is a wind of teaching that carries the believers away from the genuine oneness. It is not a matter of whether a certain kind of speaking is right or wrong; it is a matter of whether or not it is divisive.</p>
<p>Satan is subtle. It is difficult to seduce people by using something that is obviously wrong. However, anything that is good and right can easily be used to attract people. Whether a certain thing is divisive or not does not depend on whether that thing is right or wrong; it depends on whether that thing divides or does not divide. In recent days some have declared that they have come back to the enjoyment of Christ. This kind of speaking seems very good, because to enjoy Christ is a wonderful thing. However, if we use this wonderful thing to designate ourselves, to separate ourselves from others, this is divisive.</p>
<h2 class="head3">All Growing Up into the Head, Christ,<br />
in All Things by Holding the Truth in Love<br />
and Being Built Up in the Organic Body<br />
of Christ by Each One Part Functioning<br />
in Its Measure</h2>
<p>We all need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things by holding the truth in love and being built up in the organic Body of Christ by each one part, that is, each member, functioning in its measure (Eph. 4:15-16). When we grow in life and function as members of the Body, we will spontaneously grow up into Christ. This growing up into Christ, the Head, equals the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness to Fulfill<br />
the Aspiration and Prayer of the Lord</h2>
<p>The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God fulfills the aspiration and prayer of the Lord in John 17. The first kind of oneness is the oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer. Then, in the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, that aspiration and prayer was accomplished but was not yet fulfilled. Finally, in the third kind of oneness, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, the oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer is fulfilled. This third kind of oneness is the practical oneness for us to live in the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PROPER ONE ACCORD<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6; Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14; Phil. 1:27; 1 Cor. 1:10; Rev. 1:4a, 11-12, 20; 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; Col. 4:16; 1 Cor. 11:16; 14:33-34; Acts 15:1-31; 1 Thes. 2:14; 1 Cor. 1:11-13; Phil. 1:15, 17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE ACCORD<br />
BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE ONENESS</h2>
<p>In this series of messages I have put the genuine oneness first and the proper one accord second. Strictly speaking, the genuine oneness is not of the church but of the Body; it is the Body&rsquo;s own organic oneness. In Ephesians 4:4, after telling us to keep the oneness of the Spirit, Paul did not say, &ldquo;One church and one Spirit...&rdquo;; rather, he said, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit....&rdquo; The church may be plural as the churches in different localities, but the Body could never be plural. Whether it is viewed locally or universally, the Body is one. In contrast, the church is universally one but locally many.</p>
<p>In the Body we need oneness; in the churches and among the churches, we need the one accord. The one accord is for our practice; the oneness is primarily for the actuality, for the fact. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for such a fact, and on the day of Pentecost, by pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit, He accomplished His prayer. That was the actuality of the oneness. After the accomplishment of the actuality of the oneness, there is the need for the practice of the oneness. When the oneness is practiced, it becomes the one accord. The one accord is the practice of the oneness.</p>
<p>If we have only the oneness as an actuality, and do not have the present, practical one accord, the oneness that we have will be objective and abstract; it will not be real to us. If we would apply the oneness accomplished by the outpouring of the Spirit, we must practice the one accord. If among us there is no one accord, how could we say that there is oneness? If in a prayer meeting we each pray in our own way, without any accord among us, how could we say that we are practicing the oneness? As long as we have differences existing among us, the oneness is not applied. We must have the one accord to swallow up all the differences; then oneness will be present.</p>
<p>The practice of the proper one accord in the church is the application of the oneness. Although oneness and one accord seem to be synonymous, there is a difference between them. The Lord did not teach us concerning oneness. In John 17 He prayed for oneness, but in Matthew 18 He led us to practice the one accord. In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke of two praying together on earth in one accord. That was His leading, His training, and His directing us to pray in one accord. As a test of whether we are practicing the oneness or not, we may check to see whether there is one accord in our prayer meeting. When certain ones pray, we may shake our head as an indication of our displeasure, and when others pray, we may nod our head as an expression of our agreement. Such a shaking and nodding of our head is strong evidence that we do not practice oneness, because we do not have the one accord.</p>
<p>To say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; in response to others&rsquo; prayer is a practice taught by Paul in 1 Corinthians. In 14:16 Paul said that we need to pray in such a way that others can say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; If there are no Amens to indicate our one accord, we should not expect that our prayer will be heard. If only two on earth pray in one accord, their prayer will be answered. The one accord is the practice, the application, of the oneness, and the oneness is the basis on which we practice the one accord. This is very meaningful.</p>
<p>In a church meeting there may be people of different races and colors. Our one accord could never be based on the different races and colors. We practice one accord based on the fact that we all have a common life. We may be different in race and in the color of our skin, but when we come together to pray, we must forget about the different races and colors. We do have a base for our oneness; thus, we can practice the one accord.</p>
<p>Not only so, if we do not have the same understanding, the same intention, the same purpose, the same goal, it will be impossible to pray together in one accord. There will be no base for such prayer. If we each have our own opinion, our own intention, and our own goal, there will be no base on which we can pray in one accord. But when we who are saved and who love the Lord and mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s purpose come together, we surely have the base to pray in one accord.</p>
<p>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for the oneness of His believers. That oneness was only in His aspiration. A little more than fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration was accomplished. The oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration became the oneness in actuality. This oneness is called &ldquo;the oneness of the Spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 4:3), the Spirit here being the consummated Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, as the consummation of the entire Triune God. We, the saved ones, possess this oneness as our heritage. We possess this oneness, we enjoy it, and we apply it. To apply this oneness is to keep it, and to keep it is to practice one accord.</p>
<p>If in our Christian life and our church life we do not practice one accord, we conduct ourselves as if we are unlearned people who do not know that there is such a thing as the oneness of the Spirit. Suppose you have one billion dollars in your checking account. If you never write checks, it will seem as if you do not have a checking account at all, or that your account has a zero balance. Your writing of checks is the practice of your realization that there is one billion dollars in your checking account. The one billion dollars in your checking account is your possession. We may liken the oneness of the Spirit to a one billion dollar deposit in our heavenly bank account. Therefore, every day and in every meeting we need to &ldquo;write checks&rdquo;; that is, we need to exercise to apply the oneness of the Spirit to the present situation.</p>
<p>The oneness that we possess in all the churches is not merely the oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer. The oneness in John 17 may be likened to a promissory note. We do not have merely a promissory note; we possess a real bank deposit, for the promised &ldquo;cash&rdquo; has actually been &ldquo;deposited into the bank&rdquo; and has become our possession. We may consider this possession as our inheritance. The oneness that we have is the accomplished oneness, the oneness of the Spirit. We all have the Spirit in our &ldquo;bank account,&rdquo; that is, in our spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16). This Spirit who is in our spirit is the equivalent of the oneness. We have the oneness as a deposit in our account, but we may not write &ldquo;checks of oneness&rdquo; because we may not remain in the spirit. Instead, we may remain in our mind. When a certain brother prays, we may be in our mind discerning whether that brother&rsquo;s prayer is genuine, or whether there is hidden intention in his prayer. Thus, we may not say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to his prayer. In such a situation, there is no practice of oneness. The one accord actually is the using of the oneness, which is the using of our possession. We all need to realize and to learn that not to be one with the saints, not to have one accord with others in the church, is serious. This indicates that the oneness is not applied.</p>
<p>To keep the oneness, to apply the oneness, to use the oneness, to enjoy the oneness, to spend the oneness, we need to practice the one accord. However, we should practice the one accord not only among the saints in our particular locality; we must practice the one accord among all the churches universally. During the past two and a half years, the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches was promoted among us. This teaching was based mainly on the book <em>The Churches of God</em> by G. H. Lang. This kind of teaching encourages and even promotes differences among the churches. It is serious to say that all the churches should be different. We are not for uniformity among the churches, but we are for oneness.</p>
<p>Uniformity and oneness are not the same thing. In a family there may be a grandfather and a grandmother who are over eighty years of age, a father and a mother who are about fifty years of age, and a number of children ranging from eighteen down to four years of age. They all are different in age, different in the degree of maturity. In such a family it would be impossible to make all the members uniformly the same age. However, although the members of a family can never be the same age, they can still be one. Likewise, in the church we do not practice uniformity because in the household of God, a large household, there are many degrees of maturity among the children. To eliminate the degrees of maturity would be absolutely wrong and would be impossible. However, this does not mean that we do not need oneness. In the practicality of the church life, as in the family life, there is the need of oneness; but in the degree of the growth in life, it is impossible to have uniformity. To make all the children the same in the growth in life is not to practice oneness; it is to practice uniformity. To have a clear vision of the proper one accord as the practice of the genuine oneness also is a part of the scriptural remedy for the intrinsic problem in the present rebellion among us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>When we practice the proper one accord, we must realize the attributes of the church as the unique Body of Christ. The church has its own attributes, and all the attributes of the church have the oneness. Oneness becomes the attributes of the church. This is because the factors of the church are one, the elements of the church are one, the means of the church are one, and the goal of the church is one. According to Ephesians 4:4-6, there is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope. These are seven attributes of the church. Every attribute of the church is one. Oneness is the striking characteristic of the attributes of the church. Thus, when we speak of or touch the church, we must realize that the church is altogether a matter of oneness. It gives us no ground not to be one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER ONE ACCORD IN THE CHURCH<br />
BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE GENUINE<br />
ONENESS OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>The proper one accord in the church is the practice of the genuine oneness of the Body (Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14). In Matthew 18:19, before the Lord prayed for the oneness in John 17, He trained His disciples to practice the one accord. Actually, as we have seen, to be in the one accord is to practice the oneness. A little more than forty days after the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17, the one hundred twenty disciples practiced the Lord&rsquo;s direction in Matthew 18 by praying together in one accord (Acts 1:14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being in One Spirit, with One Soul</h2>
<p>When we practice the one accord, we must learn to be in one spirit and with one soul (Phil. 1:27). We may be bodily sitting together in the same room, but if we are not one in our spirit, it is certain that we will not be one in our soul. To practice the one accord, we must learn to turn to our spirit and then to enter into our soul with the spirit that we may be in the one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Attuned in the Same Mind<br />
and in the Same Opinion</h2>
<p>To practice the one accord, we must be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion (1 Cor. 1:10). To be attuned in the same mind is to practically be one in our soul. When the thoughts in our mind are expressed in our speaking, they become our opinions. When the opinions remain in our mind, they are simply our thoughts. When our differences in thinking are expressed as opinions, that may cause a problem.</p>
<p>The Corinthian believers were not attuned in the same mind; thus, they spoke differently in the flesh. Some said, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; and others, &ldquo;I am of Apollos&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Cephas&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:12). The supposedly spiritual ones among them said, &ldquo;I am of Christ.&rdquo; This too was the expressing of an opinion. This kind of different speaking caused divisions among the Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASE OF THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE PROPER ONE ACCORD IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that not only all the saints but even all the churches must be in one accord. As recorded in Acts 15, certain Judaizers came down from Judea to Antioch, teaching the Gentile believers that they had to be circumcised in order to be saved. To make circumcision a requirement for salvation in the New Testament jeopardizes the redemptive work of Christ. Hence, this was a great heresy that concerned all the churches. Thus, the churches came together to find a unique solution to this problem, a solution that could satisfy all the churches and keep the one accord among the churches.</p>
<p>The practice of the proper one accord in the church is based upon the following eight items.</p><h2 class="head2">The Identity of the Churches</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Seven Golden Lampstands, Symbols<br />
of the Seven Churches, Being All Identical</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:11-12 and 20, the seven golden lampstands, symbols of the seven local churches in Asia, are all identical in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression. In all these aspects the seven lampstands are identical. This signifies that all the local churches should be the same in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression. The seven lampstands were identical to the point that if they were placed side-by-side before our eyes, we could not discern which is which.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seven Churches Differing<br />
in the Business Affairs of Their Administration</h2>
<p>Today a certain kind of teaching is being promulgated among the churches encouraging the churches to be different from one another. However, the normal differences among the churches can be only in the business affairs of their administration. Although the Lord did not touch business affairs in the seven epistles to the seven churches, as a rule, according to their practical needs, the churches should be different in the business affairs of their administration. These affairs include such matters as the times of the church meetings, and whether the church purchases property and builds a meeting hall or simply rents a room or a building for its meetings. In matters such as these, there is no need for the churches to be identical. To require all the churches to be identical in these matters would be very awkward.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seven Churches Being the Same<br />
Normally in the Positive Things</h2>
<p>The seven churches were the same normally in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ. In all the positive things concerning the Lord Jesus, the churches should be the same. In the Lord&rsquo;s speaking to the seven churches, the positive things were commended, strengthened, encouraged, and exalted by the Lord for the abounding. These positive things include: in Ephesus, labor, endurance, and the hating of the works of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:2-3, 6); in Smyrna, the suffering of tribulation, poverty, and trial, and being faithful (2:9-10); in Pergamos, holding fast the Lord&rsquo;s name and not denying the faith of the Lord (2:13); in Thyatira, love, faith, service, and endurance (2:19); in Sardis, not defiling their garments (3:4); and in Philadelphia, keeping the word of the Lord and not denying His name (3:8, 10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seven Churches Differing Abnormally<br />
Only in the Negative Things</h2>
<p>The seven churches differed abnormally only in the negative things, which were rebuked, judged, condemned, and corrected by the Lord for elimination. These negative things include: in Ephesus, some calling themselves apostles and not being such, and the church leaving its first love (Rev. 2: 1a, 2, 4); in Pergamos, the church settling in the world, some holding the teaching of Balaam, and some holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans (2:12a, 13-15); in Thyatira, the church tolerating the woman Jezebel to teach and lead the Lord&rsquo;s slaves to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices (2:18a, 20); in Sardis, the church having a name that it was living but it was dead, and its works not being found by Christ completed before God (3:1-2); and in Laodicea, the church being neither cold nor hot, but boasting, &ldquo;I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing&rdquo; (3:14-15, 17). The Lord&rsquo;s rebuking indicates that the Lord does not want such differences.</p>
<p>By reading the epistles to the seven churches in Revelation, we can see that all the local churches should be the same in positive things, but not in negative things. The churches should be different only in business affairs. For example, whether a church buys a piece of land and builds a meeting hall should depend on the church&rsquo;s need and on the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty. The churches should not be required to follow one another in affairs such as these, but all the churches should be one in all the spiritual aspects concerning the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. This is the first item as the base for us to practice the proper one accord.</p><h2 class="head2">The Seven Epistles Being Written<br />
as One Book to the Seven Churches</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Each of the Seven Epistles<br />
Being Addressed by the Lord to a Particular Church in a Certain Locality</h2>
<p>The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 were written as one book to the seven churches (Rev. 1:4a). Before the book of Revelation, every epistle was written and sent particularly to a certain church. However, in Revelation, the Lord wrote seven epistles and put them together in one book. These epistles were addressed by the Lord to the seven particular churches separately (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14), but they were sent not as seven books but as one book.</p>
<h2 class="head3">All the Seven Epistles Being<br />
Closed as the Speaking of the Spirit<br />
to All the Churches</h2>
<p>Although the contents of the seven epistles differ, at the end of each epistle there is the same closing word: &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&rdquo; (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Each epistle was written to a particular church in a certain locality, yet all the seven epistles were closed in the same way, as the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking to all the churches. This means that each epistle was written to all the churches, and it indicates that all the churches should be the same. This is the second item as the base for all the churches to practice the one accord. There must be the one accord among all the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Apostle Teaching the Same Thing<br />
in All the Churches</h2>
<h2 class="head3">An Epistle Written to a Certain Church<br />
Being Also for Other Churches</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul taught the same thing in all the churches (1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17). This means that all the churches in all the different localities should be the same. In Colossians 4:16 Paul wrote, &ldquo;And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea.&rdquo; The epistle to the church in Colosse was also for the church in Laodicea, and the epistle to the church in Laodicea was also for the church in Colosse. Thus, every epistle was written not only for the receiving church but also for all the other churches. This indicates that the Lord wants all the churches to have the one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Teaching Differently Being Prohibited</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul said that he urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. To teach differently is to teach things different from what the apostles teach, that is, to teach things other than God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (1 Tim. 1:4). This indicates that all the teaching ones should teach the same things in all the churches according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Of course, this indicates also that all the churches should be one in the matter of teaching. This does not mean that in the matter of teaching all the churches should give the same messages and use the same books, even at the same time; it means that all the churches should not teach things that are different from the New Testament revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Examples of such teaching are the teaching of the Mosaic law (1 Tim. 1:7) and the teaching of Jewish genealogies (1 Tim. 1:4) by some Christian teachers at Paul&rsquo;s time, which were different from ministering Christ to people according to the proper revelation as taught in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All the Churches Being the Same<br />
in Their Custom and Practice</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Same in Custom</h2>
<p>All the churches were the same in their customs (1 Cor. 11:16). In 1 Corinthians 11:16, after instructing the saints concerning the matter of head covering, Paul said, &ldquo;But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.&rdquo; This indicates that all the churches were the same in their customs. A custom among the churches should not be considered a business affair. Paul told those who would express their opinions in order to dispute with him concerning head covering that the churches did not have the custom of disputation concerning the apostles&rsquo; teaching. This is not a matter of business; it is a matter of the customs among the churches.</p><h2 class="head3">The Same in Practice</h2>
<p>All the churches should be one also in their practice. In 1 Corinthians 14:33-34, concerning women being silent in relation to teaching with authority, Paul said, &ldquo;As in all the churches of the saints,&rdquo; indicating that all the churches should be the same in not permitting the sisters to teach with authority. This also is not a business affair in the church; it is a practice in the church. In such a practice, all the churches should be one.</p>
<p>In the churches we practice neither democracy nor autocracy, but theocracy. We all are under the Lord&rsquo;s ruling in everything and in all the practices, following His divine intention according to His holy Word; thus, there is no room for us to express our own human opinions. Unlike the world, the churches should not have the Laodicean practice of deciding matters according to people&rsquo;s opinions, which would often carry the church away from the divine economy to a decision made by a council according to human thought and on a human level. In this matter also all the churches should be the same.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The One Solution Being the Decree<br />
for All the Churches</h2>
<p>The one solution made at Jerusalem for the problem of circumcision became a decree for all the churches, both Jewish and Gentile, to keep (Acts 15:1-31). Hence, in relation to the matter of circumcision, all the churches should be the same. After the issuing of such a decree, it would have been wrong to allow the Jewish churches to keep the practice of circumcision while permitting the Gentile churches not to observe it. We should not forget that in the church, in the new man, there is no difference between the Greeks and the Jews, because in the new man Christ is every member (Col. 3:11). The one solution regarding the problem of circumcision was good for all the churches, making all the churches the same.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Gentile Churches<br />
Imitating the Jewish Churches</h2>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 2:14 Paul wrote, &ldquo;For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This indicates that the Gentile churches imitated the Jewish churches. This imitating did not make the Gentile churches Jewish; rather, it made all the churches the same in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All the Books of the New Testament,<br />
as One New Testament, Being Written to<br />
All the Saints and All the Churches Universally</h2>
<p>All the books of the New Testament, as one New Testament, that is, as one book, were written not only to their receivers but also to all the saints and to all the churches universally, that is, through all the centuries (1 Cor. 1:2). All the churches on the whole earth through all the centuries have received the same New Testament. The Lord did not write one New Testament to one church and a different New Testament to another church. In 1 Corinthians 1:2, Paul addressed his epistle &ldquo;to the church of God which is in Corinth...with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.&rdquo; The one epistle of 1 Corinthians was written to the saints in Corinth, with all the Lord&rsquo;s callers in every place. Thus, it was written to all the saints and all the churches through all the centuries. This indicates that all the churches on this earth should be the same, because they have all received the same teaching, the same New Testament. How, then, could we promote differences among the churches?</p>
<h2 class="head2">All the Churches through the Centuries<br />
Needing to Imitate All the Churches<br />
Unveiled in the New Testament</h2>
<p>All the churches through the centuries should imitate all the churches unveiled in the New Testament. Today there are those who are promoting differences among the churches, but the Bible indicates that the churches should imitate one another.</p>
<p>To imitate is to follow something that is better than what we are, what we have, and what we do. All the churches differ in degree in the positive things related to the practices in the church. Thus, they should imitate what is better in any church, that they may have some improvement and some advancement in the interest of the Lord. It is not a matter of legality; it is a matter of the degree in the growth of life.</p><h2 class="head1">A STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT<br />
TO THE PRACTICE OF THE PROPER ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>All the above eight points are a strong encouragement to the practice of the proper one accord in the church for the keeping of the genuine oneness of the Body by all the saints and all the churches universally. We must consider that all these points came sovereignly into existence that we may be one in all things related to God, Christ, and the church, that we may spontaneously be exercised to practice the one accord according to all the attributes of oneness in the divine and spiritual interests. May the Lord bless us and grace us to practice the one accord according to these attributes of oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DISCOURAGEMENT TO THE ONE ACCORD,<br />
ENCOURAGING AND PROMOTING DIVISION</h2>
<p>Any teaching contrary to the above eight points, such as the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches, is a discouragement to the one accord in the church and encourages and promotes division among the saints and among the churches. All our teachings should be in the nature and with the intention to encourage and promote the practice of the one accord for the keeping of the oneness. We should do our best in any teaching to avoid any discouragement to such a practice, so that the churches in all the localities can be built up in peace, without any disturbance, frustration, and distraction. May the Lord have mercy on all of us that we may practice the one accord to be kept from causing any kind of division and to have His economy carried out in the building up of His Body in oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUALITY OR SCRIPTURAL TEACHING<br />
NOT TO BE USED AS A CLOAK FOR DIVISION</h2>
<p>Any kind of spirituality or any kind of scriptural teaching should not be used as a cloak for division.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Saying &ldquo;I am of Christ&rdquo;<br />
Being Condemned by the Scripture</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:11-13, saying &ldquo;I am of Christ&rdquo; was condemned, just as saying &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Cephas.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking the Enjoyment of Christ as an Excuse<br />
for Separation or for Division<br />
Also Being Condemned</h2>
<p>Taking the enjoyment of Christ as an excuse for separating oneself from the saints or for division among the churches also is condemned, just as saying &ldquo;I am of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching Christ Because Of Envy and Strife<br />
Being Condemned by the Scripture</h2>
<p>In Philippians 1:15 and 17, the Apostle Paul condemned those who preached Christ because of envy and strife, out of rivalry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Using Teachings That Are Seemingly Scriptural<br />
as Reasons for Separation or for Division<br />
Also Being Condemned</h2>
<p>Using teachings such as the teaching concerning the headship of Christ, the teaching concerning all the churches being responsible directly to Christ alone, and the teaching concerning not exalting man, all of which seem very scriptural, as reasons for separation from the saints or for division among the churches also is condemned. As long as anything that is spiritual or scriptural causes separation or division, it is condemned.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CATHOLIC HIERARCHY</h2>
<p>The Catholic Church&rsquo;s organization, with the pope as its head and with the bishops in different ranks as subordinates, is a hierarchy, which is not scriptural and is condemned by the Lord. We abandon such hierarchy to the uttermost because it is abominable to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRETHREN &ldquo;FEDERATION&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Brethren assemblies&rsquo; uniformity, which resembles a federation, also is not scriptural.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIFFERENCES IN THE DEGREE OF MATURITY IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Any difference among the saints or among the churches in the degree of maturity in life is normal and is needed according to God&rsquo;s economy. God has arranged it so, and we should not attempt to make the saints or the churches uniform in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INTENTIONAL DIFFERENCES</h2>
<p>Any differences among the saints or among the churches that are intentional are abnormal and are condemned by the Scripture. Any intention to have differences among the saints or among the churches in order to demonstrate something or to oppose something should be condemned and rejected.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UNITY WITH VARIETY<br />
AND VARIETY VERSUS UNIFORMITY</h2>
<p>For the keeping of the oneness of the Body of Christ that we might not be sectarian, we must tolerate certain differences, such as differences in the way of baptism and in the observing of days (Rom. 14:15). This we consider as unity with variety. By tolerating this kind of variety, we annul uniformity. This is variety versus uniformity. If we practice this, we can be in one accord in spite of the variety that we may have. Of course, we know that sprinkling as a means of baptism is not as scriptural as immersion, and that the keeping of the Sabbath is altogether not in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, yet we tolerate these kinds of differences which do not damage the faith according to the New Testament revelation. We tolerate this kind of variety with the expectation that the believers who are for unscriptural practices such as these may grow in life to become more mature in the fullness of the measure of Christ so that they may drop these differences and arrive at the oneness of the faith. We earnestly hope that these believers will also be tolerant of the fact that we are not the same in these practices as they are, so that they can be in the one accord for the keeping of the oneness of the Body. To practice the proper one accord according to all the points mentioned above will surely render much help in resolving the intrinsic problem in the present rebellion in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Thus, such a practice also is a part of the scriptural remedy for the present rebellion among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>In the elders&rsquo; training in February 1986, I spoke on the matter of one accord (see <em>Elders&rsquo; Training&mdash;Book 7, One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry). In those messages I mentioned the fact that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2 was brought in through the one accord among the one hundred twenty believers (Acts 1:14; 2:1-4). Without the one accord, the outpouring of the Spirit probably would have been delayed. Hence, we need to see that the one accord among the saints and among the churches is crucial.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TESTS OF THE ONENESS OF THE BODY<br />
AND OF THE ONE ACCORD<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 11:19; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 4:6</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider all the tests in the New Testament of the genuine oneness of the Body and of the proper one accord in the church. Immediately after the oneness was accomplished in Acts chapter two, the tests began to come in chapter six. In this message I have selected fifty-one cases in the New Testament, from Acts to Revelation, in which the genuine oneness of the Body and the one accord in the churches was tested.</p>
<p>By considering all these tests and the way in which they were taken care of, we can see several things. First, we can see the actual situation of the churches at the time of the apostles. For many years I held the concept that the churches in the apostolic age were wonderful, but today my concept has changed. After considering the fifty-one tests of the oneness and of the one accord, I now realize that the churches in the age of the apostles were not as wonderful as I had thought. It is hard to tell whether their condition was better than ours or not.</p>
<p>Second, by considering this list of cases, we can learn how to face all the tests. We can learn how to solve the problems and how to take care of them. If we would ponder all these items, we will surely see the way. I believe that this is the reason that all these negative things were recorded in the New Testament. I believe the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s intention was to establish some examples from which we may learn.</p>
<p>Third, by considering all these tests of the oneness and of the one accord, we can see what things should be tolerated and what things should not be tolerated. Many things may be mistakes and may cause us trouble, yet we should not be bothered by them; they are tolerable and can be taken care of. On the other hand, by all these examples we can find a few things that the Spirit would not tolerate; they are intolerable. Concerning these things, there is the need to exercise to quarantine those who are responsible for the contagious situations.</p>
<p>I came into the recovery in Chefoo in 1932. The church life at that time was very good. I remained in Chefoo for a little over a year, and during that time I did not see anything as a test of the oneness. Then the Lord led me to leave my job and to enter into His work full-time. In October 1933 I went to Shanghai, and Brother Nee asked me to enter into the work there. After approximately one year, in the fall of 1934, a big turmoil arose. That was the first time that I saw a test of the genuine oneness and of the proper one accord. From that year until today I have passed through turmoil after turmoil, approximately one in every six to ten years. At times I have been bothered by this, thinking that our labor did not produce a satisfactory result. Fifty years ago I wondered why such things happened. At that time Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry was the highest in the entire world, but the situation was not very encouraging.</p>
<p>When I came out of mainland China and went to Taiwan, the work in Taiwan had a wonderful beginning. In less than six years, from 1949 to 1954, our number increased from fewer than five hundred to about fifty thousand. However, not long after that, a turmoil arose. Again I considered why this kind of thing happens. From that time I began to see that there was not one church recorded in the Bible that did not have any trouble. This comforted me very much, and I was much less bothered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE TEST OF THE PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE&mdash;<br />
ACTS 6:1-6</h2>
<p>The first test of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord in the church was the test of the problem of language. Here we can see that murmurings arose because of the unequal daily dispensing of food. Even in the glorious condition of the church after the day of Pentecost, murmurings arose over the matter of eating. This problem was solved by the proper service arranged by the apostles according to the practical need (vv. 2-6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE TEST OF PETER&rsquo;S CONTACT<br />
WITH THE GENTILES&mdash;ACTS 11:1-18</h2>
<p>According to the Levitical regulations (Lev. 11, cf. Acts 10:9-16, 28), the Jews were not allowed to contact the Gentiles. They considered the Gentiles unclean. However, in Acts 10 Peter contacted the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius. Because of this, a disputation arose between the disciples of the circumcision and Peter (Acts 11:2-3). This disputation was solved by Peter&rsquo;s testifying of the facts according to the truth (vv. 4-18). In dealing with such disputes, we must present the facts, and these facts must be vouchsafed by the truth. Such a big problem must be solved in this way: by the presenting of facts that are fully according to the New Testament teaching, the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE TEST OF THE HERETICAL TEACHING<br />
CONCERNING CIRCUMCISION AS A REQUIREMENT<br />
FOR SALVATION&mdash;ACTS 15:1-31</h2>
<p>The Judaizers, the Jewish believers, not only stressed the practice of circumcision, but also said that circumcision was a requirement for salvation (v. 1). This was a great heresy. No little dissension and discussion arose between the Judaic believers and those of the proper faith (vv. 2-5). This problem was solved by Paul and Barnabas and certain others among the believers going to Jerusalem from Antioch to have a conference with the apostles and the elders there (v. 2). The Bible shows us that when a question like this arises, the leading ones need to come together to have a conference, to bring everything out into the open. The problem in Acts 15 was solved by Paul and Barnabas going to Jerusalem, having a conference with the apostles and the elders there, and through thorough fellowship, working out a solution that satisfied all the believers in different localities, a solution over which all the churches rejoiced and by which they were comforted (vv. 2, 6-31). This is the way we should solve the problems among us today. I believe that if from the beginning the concerned brothers among us would have had a sincere heart with a pure motive to come together to pray, to study the Word, and to fellowship, their concerns would have been easily taken care of. However, until now the brothers have been avoiding this kind of necessary fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE TEST OF A SHARP CONTENTION BETWEEN<br />
THE TWO CO-WORKERS, PAUL AND BARNABAS,<br />
CONCERNING TAKING MARK ALONG WITH THEM&mdash;<br />
ACTS 15:36-40</h2>
<p>Paul proposed that he and Barnabas return to the places where they had worked and visit the brothers there. Barnabas intended to take Mark with them, but Paul did not consider it suitable (vv. 36-38). In their contending, both of them were frank, honest, and faithful. However, in these past two years I have not seen such frankness, honesty, and faithfulness with those who instigated the present turmoil.</p>
<p>The contention among Paul and Barnabas, with no way to resolve it, resulted in a separation between the two co-workers (vv. 39-40). This separation might not be considered a practical division, but it was surely a strong discord that seriously damaged the genuine oneness of the Body. There is no record that the problem between Paul and Barnabas was ever resolved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE TEST OF THOSE WHO MAKE DIVISIONS<br />
AND CAUSES OF FALLING CONTRARY TO<br />
THE APOSTLES&rsquo; TEACHING, DECEIVING PEOPLE<br />
BY SMOOTH AND FLATTERING SPEECH&mdash;ROM. 16:17-18</h2>
<p>I am comforted that Paul put such an item at the end of Romans, which is a book revealing how we sinners can be regenerated and transformed into mature sons of God that we may be the constituents of the churches. This is surely wonderful. However, even among the churches established by Paul, there were those who made divisions and causes of falling, deceiving people by smooth and flattering speech to draw away the believers to follow after them. Paul told the saints that they had to keep a watchful eye on such persons and turn away from them. Paul did not say that because these persons were pitiful, the saints should show them love and sympathy. Such persons damage the Body and offend Christ, the Head. Thus, Paul did not tell the saints to express their love to them. Rather, he exhorted them to keep a watchful eye on divisive persons of this kind and to turn away from them.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in the United States for over a quarter of a century. Such a thing as is described in Romans 16:17-18 has never taken place in the recovery in as serious a way as today. What has been going on among us and is still going on is exactly what is mentioned in Romans 16. Among us there are those who are making divisions and causing people to fall. As the Apostle Paul warned in Acts 20:30, these are perverted persons who speak perverted things to draw people away from the church to be their following. In Acts 20 Paul did not tell the believers to turn away from such persons, but in Romans 16, Paul did say that we should turn away from them.</p>
<p>This turning away is to exercise to quarantine the divisive, sectarian ones in order to protect the saints from being contaminated. The divisive ones are very contagious. Anyone who contacts them will be &ldquo;infected.&rdquo; This would not be good for them or for others. Thus, today we should carry out what is termed in medicine a quarantine. To quarantine a person does not mean that we do not love him. On the contrary, it means that we love both him and many others. If one member of a family contracts a contagious disease, the whole family may need to quarantine him. This is for the benefit of all the members of the family. To cut people off, to excommunicate people, was the practice of the Brethren. From the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we realized that was wrong. However, to quarantine those who are sick with a contagious spiritual disease certainly is scriptural.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE TEST OF DIVISIONS AND STRIFES AMONG<br />
THE SAINTS IN EXALTING GIFTED PERSONS&mdash;<br />
1 COR. 1:10-13</h2>
<p>This was the case among the Corinthians. Some said,&ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; some, &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; some, &ldquo;I am of Peter,&rdquo; and others, &ldquo;I am of Christ.&rdquo; They exalted the gifted ones, thus creating divisions and strifes among themselves. Saying &ldquo;I am of Christ&rdquo; seemed to be very spiritual, but it was condemned by the apostle just as saying &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Cephas,&rdquo; because it caused division just as much as the other three sayings, which apparently were very fleshly (3:3-4). All of these sayings caused division; hence, all were condemned. The apostle charged all the Corinthians to speak the same thing and to be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion in order to avoid division among them (1:10-11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE TEST OF SOME FLESHLY CORINTHIAN<br />
BELIEVERS BEING PUFFED UP AS THOUGH<br />
THE APOSTLE WERE NOT COMING TO THEM&mdash;<br />
1 COR. 4:18</h2>
<p>In dealing with this case, the apostle as a begetting father admonished the Corinthians as his beloved children (vv. 14-15). Then the apostle told them that he would come to them with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness, depending on their preference (vv. 19-21). This was the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s way to solve this problem, that is, to show his love to the troublemaking believers, who were his children, and to point out to them his God-given authority over them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. THE TEST OF A CORINTHIAN<br />
BROTHER WHO LIVED IN GROSS SIN<br />
AND WOULD NOT REPENT&mdash;1 COR. 5:1-5, 9-13</h2>
<p>In Corinth there was a brother who lived in gross sin and would not repent. The apostle had already judged such a one in the name of the Lord Jesus, with His power, to deliver him to Satan for the destruction of his flesh (vv. 3-5). The apostle charged the church in Corinth to remove this one from the fellowship among the believers (vv. 2, 9-13). This also was a kind of quarantine exercised over a sinful brother.</p>
<p>We have studied 1 Corinthians 5:13 particularly. The word translated <em>remove</em> here was taken from the Septuagint (Greek) version of the Old Testament. The removal of the sinful brother in 1 Corinthians 5 was like the putting of a leper outside the camp in the Old Testament (Lev. 13:45-46; Num. 5:2). In Numbers 12 Miriam rebelled against Moses, and she was stricken with leprosy. She was removed from the camp for seven days, until her leprosy was cleared up. This was a form of quarantining. There has been much talk among Christians concerning the matter of excommunication. It is wrong to excommunicate a believer. To excommunicate someone is to give him up; but to remove a person is to quarantine him with the hope that he would become sound.</p>
<p>The apostle charged the church in Corinth to remove the sinning one from the fellowship among the believers (1 Cor. 5:2, 9-13). He charged the church not to associate with such a one, not even to eat with him (v. 11).</p>
<p>Later, when the sinful brother repented, the apostle charged the church to forgive him by confirming their love to him, that they might not be taken advantage of by Satan, because the apostle was knowledgeable of Satan&rsquo;s devices (2 Cor. 2:5-11). Once a sinning brother has repented, the church should immediately forgive him and show its confirmed love to him. Otherwise, Satan will come in to take advantage of the church to devour the fallen and repentant believer. This is the proper way to deal with such a case, a way that takes care of 1) the purity of the church, 2) the discipline of an unrepentant believer, 3) the necessary and urgent forgiveness and confirmed love to a repentant believer, and 4) the devices of Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. THE TEST OF A BROTHER HAVING A CASE<br />
AGAINST ANOTHER BROTHER&mdash;1 COR. 6:1, 6-8</h2>
<p>In Corinth brother went to law with brother, and that before unbelievers, to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints. This took place in a church established by Paul. The apostle charged the brothers of this kind to realize that it is altogether a defeat for them that they have lawsuits among themselves, and that they should rather be wronged and rather be defrauded, that is, suffer loss, bear the cross. This is the best way to solve a problem that concerns material gain or loss.</p><h2 class="head1">X. THE TEST OF THE CORINTHIAN BELIEVERS<br />
EXAMINING PAUL AS TO HIS QUALIFICATION<br />
FOR BEING AN APOSTLE&mdash;1 COR. 9:3</h2>
<p>Paul made a defense for himself with the signs of his apostleship, and he took a strong stand concerning all his rights as an apostle (vv. 1-14; 2 Cor. 12:11-12). But for the sake of the spreading of the gospel, he had not used all the rights of his apostleship (1 Cor. 9:15-23).</p>
<p>It seems that Paul was vindicating himself in taking care of this case, but he did it in this way not for his own gain, but for the profit of the church, which would have suffered a great loss by doubting his qualification for being an apostle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XI. THE TEST OF THE BELIEVERS PARTAKING<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE UNWORTHILY&mdash;<br />
1 COR. 11:19-22, 27</h2>
<p>In dealing with this problem, Paul said that parties, sects, are unavoidable among the believers, that those who are approved may become manifest among the believers (v. 19). This was the reason Paul gave for such things happening in the churches established by him. This kind of trouble is a sifting that shows whether or not we are approved. The word <em>approved</em> can also be translated <em>experienced.</em> Our being approved indicates that we are experienced and thus, that it is not easy for us to participate in any kind of party.</p>
<p>This is the way in the experience of life to deal with such a case of trouble that indicates the shortage of growth in the spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XII. THE TEST OF SOME BELIEVERS IN CORINTH<br />
 SAYING THAT THERE IS NO RESURRECTION<br />
OF THE DEAD&mdash;1 COR. 15:12</h2>
<p>I do not believe that anyone among us has ever said that there is no resurrection of the dead. Therefore, in this sense we might be a little better than the churches established by Paul. In facing this test, the apostle corrected the heresy by unveiling the truth of resurrection (vv. 12-57) and by testifying to the fact of resurrection by the power and effectiveness of the resurrection of Christ (vv. 3-11). In 1 Corinthians 15:10, Paul said, &ldquo;...not I, but the grace of God.&rdquo; The grace of God is the resurrected Christ. Christ in resurrection is the grace of God. Thus, Paul testified to the fact of resurrection not only by the power but also by the effectiveness of the resurrection of Christ, which he himself had experienced.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s way of taking care of this test of heresy was excellent; but it requires the adequate knowledge of the divine truth in the New Testament teaching and the sufficient experience of the reality of the divine truth. Hence, we need to endeavor to get into the divine truths and to experience the reality of the divine truths that we may be able to take care of this kind of problem for the churches&rsquo; profit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XIII. THE TEST OF THE DISOBEDIENCE<br />
OF SOME OF THE CORINTHIAN BELIEVERS&mdash;<br />
2 COR. 10:2-10</h2>
<p>In facing such a test, the apostles first fought the spiritual warfare to overthrow the strongholds in the believers&rsquo; minds and to take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ (vv. 3-5). Then the apostles eventually would punish all disobedience among the believers (v. 6). Paul did not say that they would take revenge on persons, but that they would punish the disobedience of the disobedient ones.</p>
<p>To take care of such a case related to the spiritual warfare requires the spiritual insight to see thoroughly that the source of such a case is not in man but in the evil power of Satan and needs the ability in the divine life to fight against the evil source.</p><h2 class="head1">XIV. THE TEST OF SOME<br />
PREACHING ANOTHER JESUS,<br />
MINISTERING A DIFFERENT SPIRIT<br />
OR A DIFFERENT GOSPEL, YET THE BELIEVERS<br />
IN CORINTH BEARING WELL WITH THEM&mdash;2 COR. 11:4</h2>
<p>It is difficult to believe that in the apostolic church such a thing could have taken place. In Greek, <em>bear well with him</em> was used in an ironic sense. The Corinthian believers bore well with the heretical preachers. Taking this as a base, Paul said, ironically, that since they bore well with those heretical preachers, they should bear well with his boasting. The apostle boasted of his apostleship and his virtuous conduct by listing many items concerning himself (vv. 5-33). This shows that sometimes it is necessary to boast, making a defense and taking a standing for the benefit of the churches and the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XV. THE TEST OF SOME FLESHLY CORINTHIAN<br />
BELIEVERS CHARGING THAT THE APOSTLE,<br />
BEING CRAFTY, TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM<br />
WITH GUILE THROUGH TITUS, WHO<br />
TOOK CARE OF THE GIFTS FOR<br />
THE JEWISH BELIEVERS&mdash;<br />
2 COR. 12:16-18a</h2>
<p>The Corinthians accused Paul of sending Titus to collect the offerings for the Jewish saints in Judea and, by so doing, stealing money from them in guile. To this the apostle responded that both he and Titus walked in the same spirit and in the same steps (v. 18b). In fact, the apostle, like parents for their children, would most gladly have spent (money) and been utterly spent, that is, exhausted (himself), on behalf of the believers&rsquo; souls (vv. 14-15).</p>
<p>This shows that the Apostle Paul, when slandered by the fleshly believers, did vindicate his honesty and generosity for the benefit of the evil-intentioned slanderers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XVI. THE TEST OF SOME JEWISH BELIEVERS<br />
TROUBLING THE GALATIAN BELIEVERS<br />
AND DESIRING TO PERVERT THE GOSPEL<br />
OF CHRIST WITH A DIFFERENT GOSPEL,<br />
THAT IS, THE JUDAIC OBSERVANCES<br />
OF THE LAW&mdash;GAL. 1:6-7</h2>
<p>The Judaizers considered the observing of the law a gospel. The apostle cursed these heretical Jewish preachers (vv. 8-9). The apostle, a slave of Christ, was not persuading men or seeking to please men (v. 10). Thus, he condemned the heretical ones. For the truth of the gospel we need to learn of the apostle&rsquo;s faithfulness, frankness, and boldness in cursing the heretics and not trying to please men.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XVII. THE TEST OF PETER BEING HYPOCRITICAL<br />
IN RELATION TO THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL<br />
DUE TO HIS FEARING OF THE BELIEVERS<br />
OF THE CIRCUMCISION&mdash;GAL. 2:12-13</h2>
<p>Paul opposed and condemned Peter to his face and rebuked him in front of all (vv. 11, 14). In doing this, Paul was not merciful, and many would consider him unwise. Later, however, Peter still recommended Paul and confirmed his teachings as having the same standing as the rest of the Scriptures (2 Pet. 3:15-16).</p>
<p>Paul was faithful to the truth of the gospel and honest toward Peter for his correction, and Peter was humble in bearing Paul&rsquo;s rebuking. In his old age, Peter wrote a letter in which he recommended Paul highly and confirmed the standing of his writings among the Scriptures. We all need to learn of both Paul and Peter in their spiritual virtues.</p><h2 class="head1">XVIII. THE TEST OF A BROTHER BEING OVERTAKEN<br />
IN SOME OFFENSE&mdash;GAL. 6:1</h2>
<p>The apostle instructed the believers, saying that the spiritual ones should restore such a one in a spirit of meekness. It is common for believers to be overtaken in some offense. Those who restore such a one should consider themselves lest they also be tempted. To take care of such a case of restoration, there is the need of spiritual maturity with a heart that loves the brother and with a burden to recover him. In carrying out such a restoration, we must do it in fear and with consideration, not in a light and careless way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XIX. THE TEST OF SOME PREACHING CHRIST<br />
BECAUSE OF ENVY AND STRIFE, OUT OF RIVALRY,<br />
NOT PURELY, THINKING TO RAISE UP AFFLICTION<br />
IN THE APOSTLE PAUL&rsquo;S BONDS&mdash;PHIL. 1:15, 17</h2>
<p>When Paul was in prison, the Judaizers made more trouble for him. Paul rejoiced in that Christ was announced even in pretense (v. 18). Yet Paul considered those Judaic preachers dogs, evil workers, and the concision, and warned the saints in Philippi to beware of them as such (3:2). On the one hand, Paul rejoiced over their preaching, and on the other hand, he considered them dogs, evil workers, and the concision. (<em>Concision</em> is a term of contempt for <em>circumcision.</em> ) We need to learn of Paul in his discernment in judging things. In this case, the preaching of Christ was good, but the preachers were evil in their preaching because of envy, strife, and rivalry, and with a purpose to afflict others. We should not condemn the preaching because of the evil preacher, nor should we accept the evil preacher because of his good preaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XX. THE TEST OF TWO SISTERS,<br />
EUODIAS AND SYNTYCHE, BEING DIFFERENT<br />
IN THEIR THINKING&mdash;PHIL. 4:2</h2>
<p>It is easy for sisters to be different in their thinking. The apostle besought the two sisters to think the same thing in the Lord, and he asked his genuine yokefellow to assist the two sisters, who contended with him in the gospel (v. 3). The way the apostle took care of this case was gentle and loving. Gentleness and loving consideration for others are always necessary weapons in correcting others&rsquo; mistakes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXI. THE TEST OF WRONG TEACHING,<br />
EITHER BY SPIRIT, OR BY WORD, OR BY<br />
A LETTER IN THE NAME OF THE APOSTLES, CONCERNING THE DAY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING&mdash;<br />
2 THES. 2:2</h2>
<p>The apostle warned the believers not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed and not to be deceived in any way (vv. 2a, 3a). He then rendered the proper teaching to the believers concerning the day of the Lord&rsquo;s appearing (vv. 3b-8). To solve this kind of problem, the right way is to give people the proper teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXII. THE TEST OF SOME WALKING<br />
AMONG THE BELIEVERS DISORDERLY,<br />
WORKING AT NOTHING, BUT BEING BUSYBODIES&mdash;<br />
2 THES. 3:11</h2>
<p>The apostle gave the believers the charge that if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat (v. 10). The apostle also charged and entreated in the Lord that working with quietness they might eat their own bread (v. 12). The apostle&rsquo;s way in dealing with this case was very practical.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXIII. THE TEST OF CERTAIN ONES<br />
TEACHING DIFFERENTLY, OCCUPYING<br />
THEMSELVES WITH THINGS OTHER THAN<br />
GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY, WHICH IS IN FAITH&mdash;1 TIM. 1:3-4</h2>
<p>The apostle urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. The apostle also gave the correcting word according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which he was entrusted (vv. 5-11).</p>
<p>To take care of such a case, we should not merely correct, but should supply the proper teachings to replace the wrong teachings. In taking care of such a problem that concerns God&rsquo;s economy, we need the adequate knowledge of the holy Word, which conveys the full revelation of God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h2 class="head1">XXIV. THE TEST OF SOME DEPARTING FROM<br />
THE FAITH, GIVING HEED TO DECEIVING SPIRITS<br />
AND TEACHINGS OF DEMONS IN THE HYPOCRISY<br />
OF MEN WHO SPEAK LIES&mdash;1 TIM. 4:1-2</h2>
<p>The apostle gave the correcting word (vv. 3-5). The apostle also charged Timothy to lay these things before the brothers so that Timothy would be a good minister of Christ, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which he had closely followed (v. 6). To take care of this test, we need to have a great deal of learning, as Paul had.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXV. THE TEST OF AN ELDER COMMITTING SIN<br />
AND BEING ACCUSED BY THE BELIEVERS&mdash;<br />
1 TIM. 5:19-20</h2>
<p>The apostle charged Timothy not to receive an accusation against an elder without two or three witnesses, and charged him to reprove the sinning elder before all that the rest might be in fear. The apostle also solemnly charged Timothy before God, Christ, and the chosen angels to keep the apostle&rsquo;s words without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality (v. 21). Here we can see the frankness of the apostle, and also his faithfulness. He charged Timothy not just by himself, but before God, before Christ, and even before the chosen angels. The eldership is related to God&rsquo;s authority. It is for this reason that Paul mentioned the angels here, since the angels are subject to God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXVI. THE TEST OF ALL THE BELIEVERS IN ASIA<br />
TURNING AWAY FROM PAUL&mdash;2 TIM. 1:15</h2>
<p>The turning away in this case probably did not constitute a division. It surely was a separation that damaged the oneness of the Body of Christ. Nevertheless, the Apostle Paul was altogether not affected; rather, he encouraged Timothy to be empowered in the grace of the Lord (2:1). If we are going to take care of such a case, we must not be shaken by anyone&rsquo;s turning away from the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, but must be strong in the power of the Lord&rsquo;s grace for God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXVII. THE TEST OF THE PROFANE WORD<br />
BEING SPREAD LIKE GANGRENE BY THE PARTY<br />
OF HYMENAEUS AND PHILETUS, WHO MISAIMED<br />
CONCERNING THE TRUTH, SAYING THAT<br />
THE RESURRECTION HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE,<br />
AND OVERTHREW THE FAITH OF SOME&mdash;2 TIM. 2:17-18</h2>
<p>In this section of the Word, Paul exposed the names of two heretics, Hymenaeus and Philetus. The Apostle Paul had the assurance that the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, &ldquo;The Lord knows those who are His,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness&rdquo; (v. 19). In spite of the heresy being spread like gangrene, God has a standing, namely, that His faithful ones who call on the name of the Lord would depart from unrighteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXVIII. THE TEST OF MEN BEING LOVERS OF SELF,<br />
LOVERS OF MONEY, AND LOVERS OF PLEASURE<br />
RATHER THAN LOVERS OF GOD,<br />
HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS BUT<br />
HAVING DENIED ITS POWER,<br />
MEN CORRUPTED IN MIND, DISAPPROVED<br />
CONCERNING THE FAITH&mdash;2 TIM. 3:2-8</h2>
<p>To face this test, the Apostle Paul reminded Timothy that he had closely followed the apostle&rsquo;s teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance, persecutions, and sufferings (vv. 9-11a). This indicates that to face such a test we need to be an example in teaching and conduct in the days of apostasy.</p><h2 class="head1">XXIX. THE TEST OF DEMAS HAVING LOVED<br />
THE PRESENT AGE, FORSAKING PAUL&mdash;2 TIM. 4:10</h2>
<p>Demas&rsquo; forsaking of Paul also should not be considered a division, but was a separation, which is always a damage to the oneness in the Body of Christ. However, Paul was not discouraged even at the time of his martyrdom (v. 6); rather, he was still very active in taking care of his co-workers and all the necessary things (vv. 11-13). This should be a pattern to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXX. THE TEST OF ALEXANDER THE COPPERSMITH<br />
HAVING DONE MANY THINGS AGAINST PAUL&mdash;<br />
2 TIM. 4:14</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul put his trust in the Lord concerning the evil attacks. He believed that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work and would save him unto his heavenly kingdom (v. 18). He also had the assurance that the Lord will award to him the crown of righteousness at the Lord&rsquo;s appearing for his participation in the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom (vv. 8, 1). This was the apostle&rsquo;s way to face all the adverse situations. We should learn of him.</p>
<p>In facing the above five tests by exposing them to Timothy, the Apostle Paul could not avoid the mentioning of the names of five persons: Phygelus, Hermogenes, Hymenaeus, Philetus, and Alexander the coppersmith (1:15; 2:17; 4:14). This indicates that sometimes in dealing with some negative things that greatly damage the interest of the Lord, we may be forced to mention the names of those who are involved in the negative things, for the building up of the positive saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXI. THE TEST OF A FACTIOUS,<br />
SECTARIAN MAN&mdash;TITUS 3:10-11</h2>
<p>We should refuse such a one after a first and second admonition, knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned. To refuse such a one is to exercise to quarantine him. When a believer is divisive, factious, sectarian, he becomes contagious; therefore, we need to refuse him, that is, to quarantine him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXII. THE TEST OF ANYONE AMONG THE BELIEVERS<br />
 BEING LED ASTRAY FROM THE TRUTH&mdash;<br />
JAMES 5:19-20</h2>
<p>Someone should turn him back, knowing that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins. This is to restore from his sins a brother who is erring in the truth. To do this requires love, spirituality, and adequate knowledge.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXIII. THE TEST OF FALSE TEACHERS AMONG<br />
THE BELIEVERS WHO SECRETLY BRING IN<br />
DESTRUCTIVE HERESIES, EVEN DENYING THE<br />
MASTER WHO BOUGHT THEM, AND MANY FOLLOWING<br />
THEIR LICENTIOUSNESS, BECAUSE OF WHOM<br />
THE WAY OF THE TRUTH WILL BE REVILED;<br />
BY COVETOUSNESS WITH FABRICATED WORDS<br />
THEY MAKE MERCHANDISE OF THE BELIEVERS&mdash;<br />
2 PET. 2:1-3</h2>
<p>The false teachers in this case were heretics in the ancient time, like today&rsquo;s modernists. For them the judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber. The believers should take Noah, a herald of righteousness, and righteous Lot as examples (vv. 5, 7). In a situation of destructive heresies, we should learn how to follow the faithful saints who stand fast in the truth against any kind of heresies.</p><h2 class="head1">XXXIV. THE TEST OF MOCKERS MOCKING<br />
ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LUSTS, SAYING,<br />
&ldquo;WHERE IS THE PROMISE OF HIS COMING?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
2 PET. 3:3-4</h2>
<p>The truth is hidden from the heretical mockers by their own willfulness (v. 5a). Because they are willfully ignorant, the truth in the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures is covered from their sight. Therefore, Peter reminded the believers to remember the word of God spoken by the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles (vv. 1-2, 5b, 7). This indicates that to take care of such a case of heresy, we need to help the believers to hold to the holy Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXV. THE TEST OF MANY ANTICHRISTS<br />
HAVING COME&mdash;1 JOHN 2:18</h2>
<p>The antichrists deny that Jesus is the Christ (v. 22). The believers should abide in the Lord according to His anointing (vv. 20, 27). To take care of this case of heresy, we need the experience of abiding in the Lord according to His anointing, and we should charge the believers not to listen to the heretical teaching, but to take care of the inner anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXVI. THE TEST OF THE SPIRIT THAT<br />
DOES NOT CONFESS JESUS CHRIST HAVING COME<br />
IN THE FLESH&mdash;1 JOHN 4:1-6</h2>
<p>This again is a case of heresy. The spirit in this case is not out of God but is of the antichrist; it is not the Spirit of truth but the spirit of deception. The antichrists are out of the world; the believers are out of God. The believers have overcome the false prophets in verse 1 and the antichrist in verse 3, because greater is He who is in the believers than he who is in the world.</p>
<p>To confront such a case of heresy, we need the experience of 1) the Triune God as the all-inclusive, anointing Spirit, who is in us, being greater than Satan as the evil spirit who is in the world, and 2) the world having been overcome by us through the indwelling Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXVII. THE TEST OF A BELIEVER SEEING A BROTHER<br />
 SINNING A SIN NOT UNTO DEATH&mdash;1 JOHN 5:16</h2>
<p>He should ask, that is, pray, for the sinning one. By so doing, he will give life to such a one. To give life to such a one is to minister life to the sinning one in our contacting of him. This requires us to have a certain amount of the divine love to care for the sinning one, and to have a certain degree of growth in the divine life that we may have the riches of the divine life to share with him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XXXVIII. THE TEST OF MANY DECEIVERS,<br />
AS ANTICHRISTS, GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD,<br />
NOT CONFESSING JESUS CHRIST COMING<br />
IN THE FLESH BUT GOING BEYOND<br />
THE TEACHING OF CHRIST&mdash;<br />
2 JOHN 7, 9-11</h2>
<p>This is the case involving the greatest heresy. The Apostle John charged the believers not to receive the heretical antichrists into their houses and even not to say to the heretics, &ldquo;Rejoice!&rdquo; (v. 10). To say &ldquo;Rejoice&rdquo; to someone is to greet him. He who says to these heretics, &ldquo;Rejoice,&rdquo; shares in their heretical, evil works (v. 11). This is a strong quarantine exercised over the heretics who do not confess the incarnation of Christ, who came in the flesh. Here there is the need of our boldness and frankness to keep the divine truth concerning Christ&rsquo;s divine person in His divinity and humanity. Any compromise in dealing with heresies concerning Christ&rsquo;s person should be abandoned.</p><h2 class="head1">XXXIX. THE TEST OF DIOTREPHES,<br />
WHO LOVED TO BE FIRST IN THE CHURCH<br />
IN WHICH GAIUS WAS&mdash;3 JOHN 9, 1</h2>
<p>Diotrephes did not receive the apostles and babbled against them with evil words; neither did he receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbade and cast them out of the church. If the Apostle John would have come to the church, he would have brought Diotrephes&rsquo; works to the remembrance of the believers (v. 10). We need to be careful in dealing with such a case. Diotrephes&rsquo; actions surely constituted a great sin. However, the apostle did not indicate that Diotrephes&rsquo; sin was intolerable to the extent that he needed to be quarantined. John did not tell us to quarantine such a person. Even sinful acts such as this in the church life should be dealt with through much consideration, with the expectation that the sinful acts could be corrected after a certain amount of loving rebuking and punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XL. THE TEST OF THOSE WHO<br />
HAVE GONE IN THE WAY OF CAIN,<br />
POURED THEMSELVES OUT IN THE ERROR<br />
OF BALAAM FOR REWARD, AND<br />
PERISHED IN THE REBELLION OF KORAH,<br />
GOING ON ACCORDING TO THEIR LUSTS,<br />
ADMIRING PERSONS FOR THE SAKE<br />
OF ADVANTAGE&mdash;JUDE 11, 16</h2>
<p>These apostates were hidden reefs in the believers&rsquo; love feasts, shepherds who fed themselves, waterless clouds, autumn trees without fruit, wild waves of the sea, and wandering stars (vv. 12-13). Jude exhorted the believers to remember the words spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, who said that in the last time there will be mockers going on according to their own ungodly lusts, making separations, soulish, not having spirit (vv. 17-19). Jude exhorted the believers also to build up themselves in their most holy faith, pray in the Holy Spirit, and keep themselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life (v. 20). This shows that in such a situation of apostasy, the best way for us is to exhort the believers in the positive way that Jude did.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLI. THE TEST OF SOME IN EPHESUS<br />
CALLING THEMSELVES APOSTLES<br />
AND NOT BEING SUCH&mdash;REV. 2:1A, 2</h2>
<p>What these false apostles did in their false assuming and pretense was a great damage, carried out by Satan, to the building up of the Body of Christ (2 Cor. 11:13-15). This was a real test of the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ. We should follow the positive example of the church in Ephesus by trying these false apostles and finding them to be false.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN EPHESUS<br />
LEAVING ITS FIRST LOVE&mdash;REV. 2:4</h2>
<p>The church in Ephesus was praised by the Lord for its works, labor, endurance, not bearing evil men, and trying the false apostles and finding them false (v. 2). However, it was rebuked by the Lord for leaving its first love. To leave the first love is to become indifferent and dormant in the appreciation of the Lord&rsquo;s excellency and preciousness and also in gratitude for the Lord&rsquo;s love in His redemptive work for us. This is the root of the degradation of the church through the centuries. For this the Lord admonished the church in Ephesus to repent; otherwise, its lampstand would be removed. The removing of the lampstand implies the losing of the power to shine in the darkness and to testify for the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s admonishing is the way for us to take care of a case of leaving the first love towards the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">XLIII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN PERGAMOS<br />
BEING SETTLED IN THE WORLD, WHERE SATAN&rsquo;S DWELLING AND THRONE ARE&mdash;<br />
REV. 2:12A, 13</h2>
<p>The church in Pergamos became worldly and was even settled in the world, where Satan&rsquo;s dwelling and throne are. This caused her to be joined with Satan in the Satanic cosmos&mdash; the system of darkness&mdash;which is against God and His economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLIV. THE TEST OF SOME IN PERGAMOS<br />
HOLDING THE TEACHING OF BALAAM, WHO CAUSED<br />
 THE SONS OF ISRAEL TO STUMBLE IN EATING<br />
IDOL SACRIFICES AND COMMITTING<br />
 FORNICATION&mdash;REV. 2:14</h2>
<p>Becoming worldly and even settled in the world led some members of the church to hold the teaching that caused the people of God to stumble in eating idol sacrifices and committing fornication. Becoming worldly always issues in idolatry and fornication. These three always go together, one along with another, damaging the people of God in their carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLV. THE TEST OF SOME IN PERGAMOS<br />
HOLDING THE TEACHING OF THE NICOLAITANS&mdash;<br />
REV. 2:15</h2>
<p>The Nicolaitans should be a group of people who esteemed themselves higher than the common believers. They constituted a hierarchy that was versus the building up of the Body of Christ, like the hierarchy in Catholicism and Protestantism. Such a hierarchy is hated by the Lord (v. 6) because it destroys God&rsquo;s New Testament economy concerning the church.</p>
<p>To deal with such a complicated case as the case of the church in Pergamos being one with the world and some of its members holding the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans requires us to be one with the Lord in standing against the world as the satanic system of darkness, and requires us to hate idolatry, spiritual fornication, and the sin of hierarchy&mdash;the evil system of organization in religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLVI. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN THYATIRA<br />
TOLERATING THE WOMAN JEZEBEL,<br />
WHO TAUGHT AND LED THE LORD&rsquo;S SLAVES<br />
ASTRAY TO COMMIT FORNICATION<br />
AND TO EAT IDOL SACRIFICES&mdash;<br />
REV. 2:18A, 20</h2>
<p>Jezebel was the pagan wife of King Ahab (1 Kings 16:31). She was a type of the apostate Catholic Church and a figure of the woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, who brought evil, heretical, and pagan things as leaven into the teaching concerning Christ, and who became the great prostitute in Revelation 17, who mixes abominations with the divine things and who leads the Lord&rsquo;s slaves astray to commit fornication and to worship idols. Of all these she is not willing to repent, and for all these the Lord will destroy her (Rev. 2:21-23).</p>
<p>To handle such a great case of the apostasy of the degraded church, we need to be equipped with the knowledge of the history of the church&rsquo;s degradation and with the knowledge of the divine revelation concerning the church in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLVII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS<br />
HAVING A NAME THAT IT WAS LIVING,<br />
BUT IT WAS DEAD&mdash;REV. 3:1</h2>
<p>This depicts the real situation of the present Protestant churches&mdash;seemingly living but actually dead.</p><h2 class="head1">XLVIII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS<br />
WITH THE REMAINING THINGS BEING<br />
ABOUT TO DIE&mdash;REV. 3:2A</h2>
<p>This also is a picture of the Protestant churches, with which some of the positive things remain but are about to die. Every item of the positive things inherited and received by the present Protestant churches remains in a dying situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLIX. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS<br />
HAVING ITS WORKS NOT FOUND BY CHRIST<br />
COMPLETED BEFORE GOD&mdash;REV. 3:2B</h2>
<p>This also is a portrait of the present Protestant churches, concerning which no work has been found by the Lord completed before God.</p>
<p>The three cases related to the church in Sardis all indicate a shortage of the vigor of the divine life and a lack of the power of the Holy Spirit. To take care of these cases would force us to be enriched in the vigorous divine life and to be empowered in the powerful Holy Spirit. Only the vigor of the divine life and the power of the Holy Spirit can make us living, fresh, and complete.</p>
<h2 class="head1">L. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA<br />
BEING NEITHER COLD NOR HOT&mdash;REV. 3:14A, 15-16</h2>
<p>The main meaning of the Greek name Laodicea is the opinion, the judgement, of the people. When a local church is full of peoples&rsquo; opinions, it surely will become neither cold nor hot. Because of its lukewarmness, such a church will suffer being vomited out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth. This is to be given up by the Lord because the taste of that church is repulsive. Thus, a church that is full of peoples&rsquo; opinions, peoples&rsquo; judgments, is terrible. Even we would reject such a church in the practice of the church life, not to mention that the Lord would vomit it out. Peoples&rsquo; opinions are versus God&rsquo;s judgment and authority. This is why the Lord is standing at the door of the church in Laodicea (v. 20), indicating that the Lord has been rejected by that church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LI. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA<br />
BOASTING, &ldquo;I AM RICH AND HAVE BECOME RICH<br />
AND HAVE NEED OF NOTHING,&rdquo; NOT KNOWING<br />
THAT IT WAS WRETCHED, MISERABLE, POOR,<br />
BLIND, AND NAKED&mdash;REV. 3:17</h2>
<p>An opinionated and lukewarm church would always be proud and boast of its riches, thinking that it has need of nothing, but not knowing its wretchedness, miserableness, poverty, blindness, and nakedness. Hence, the loving and merciful Lord counsels such a church to buy, to obtain at a cost from Him, refined gold (the tested faith for partaking of the divine nature), white garments (the conduct approvable to the Lord), and anointing eye salve (the anointing Spirit, the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit) as their remedies (v. 18).</p>
<p>The above items, XLI to LI, are all the negative items in which the seven local churches in Asia were different from one another. The seven churches as the seven golden lampstands were all identical in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ. But they were abnormally different in these eleven cases, all of which are serious tests that have done tremendous damage to the oneness of the organic Body of Christ. Hence, the Lord advised all seven churches to overcome all these tests that they might be rewarded (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). Otherwise, they will be punished (2:5, 11&mdash;by implication&mdash;16, 22-23; 3:3, 11, 16).</p>
<p>The seven local churches in Asia were sovereignly arranged by the Lord so that they might typify all the churches in the seven stages of the church age. Thus, regardless of what stage we are in as a local church, we should take care of all the eleven cases of negative things in the proper way as shown in Revelation 2 and 3. May the Lord have mercy on us and afford us His grace and blessing that we might not be negligent and indifferent in dealing with all these oneness-damaging problems.</p><h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>Among the fifty-one cases listed above, thirty-five, the majority, are of different kinds and were all (except case IV) taken care of positively by various adequate ways, such as the proper arrangement of the service in case I, testifying according to the truth in case II, and recovering in a spirit of meekness a brother overtaken in an offence in case XVIII, leaving only sixteen, the minority, to be taken care of in the way of quarantine. This indicates that, according to His loving concern over His dear redeemed saints, the Lord&rsquo;s intention concerning all the believers who are involved in the tests of the oneness of His Body and of the one accord of His church, is to adjust, correct, rescue, recover, and perfect them so that He can carry out the building up of His organic Body.</p>
<p>Among the sixteen cases remaining to be dealt with in the way of quarantine, there are two cases of division (cases V and XXXI), thirteen cases of heresy (cases III, XII, XVI, XXIV, XXVII, XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVIII, XL, XLIV, and XLVI), and one case of gross sin (case VIII).</p>
<p>Concerning the first case of division (case V), the Apostle Paul decisively and emphatically gave us a strong charge that we should carry out a quarantine by &ldquo;turning away from&rdquo; the divisive persons (Rom. 16:17). Concerning the second case of division (case XXXI), the Apostle Paul also charged us strongly and decisively to exercise a stern quarantine by refusing the factious, divisive person (Titus 3:10).</p>
<p>As to the thirteen cases of heresy, case III was taken care of by the proper fellowship according to the truth (Acts 15:1-31); cases XII, XXIV, XXXV, and XXXVI were taken care of by teaching; case XVI was dealt with by cursing the heretics (Gal. 1:8-9); cases XXVII, XXXIII, XXXIV, and XL were taken care of by warning the saints; cases XLIV and XLVI were dealt with by condemnation; and case XXXVIII was dealt with by the exercising of a quarantine. In case XXXVIII, the Apostle John sharply and emphatically charged us not to receive into our house a heretic who does not confess Christ&rsquo;s coming in the flesh but goes beyond the teaching of Christ, and even not to greet him, that we may not share in his evil works (2 John 7, 9-11).</p>
<p>Concerning case VIII, a case of gross sin, the Apostle Paul took care of it first by judging the sinning one in the name of the Lord and delivering him to Satan for destruction of the flesh (1 Cor. 5:3-5), and then by solemnly charging the saints to exercise to quarantine the sinning one by not eating with him and removing him from the fellowship in the church (1 Cor. 5:11, 13).</p>
<p>Among all the tests of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord of the church listed above, only three&mdash;divisions, heresies, and fornication&mdash;are intolerable and need a quarantine by the churches and the saints according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Divisions damage the Body of Christ, and heresies insult the person of Christ and also damage the work of Christ. Thus, divisions are related negatively to the Body of Christ, and heresies are related negatively to Christ in His person and His work. Fornication is a gross sin that damages the humanity made by God to be the members of the Body of Christ. If these three things are taking place in the church, the Body of Christ would be annulled, the very Christ would be altogether damaged, and the humanity used as the constituents of the Body of Christ would be fully corrupted. Therefore, these three problems cannot be tolerated, and we should exercise to quarantine those who are involved in these problems, in order to preserve the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>I hope that we will spend some time to learn the proper way to face each kind of problem. We all must be impressed that among so many kinds of problems, only three are intolerable. Even with those involved in the three intolerable sins, we must be careful to deal with them in our spirit by the Spirit. We should be careful to carry out a quarantine over them to restrict the spreading of the contagious diseases. Concerning all the others, we must exercise our longsuffering, with love, in hope of recovering them. There might be a few hopeless cases. Concerning the three problems of division, heresy, and gross sin, we need to be very careful in dealing with those involved, in order that the building up of the Body of Christ may proceed in a proper way, not allowing the Body of Christ to be damaged by divisions, Christ to be damaged by heresies, and the humanity that is for the Lord&rsquo;s Body to be damaged by gross sins. Such a study of fifty-one cases in the New Testament as tests of the genuine oneness and the proper one accord helps us to find the proper way to solve our present problem in the rebellion among us. Thus, it also is a part of the scriptural remedy for our problem.</p>
<p>We have studied the genuine oneness in Message One, the proper one accord in Message Two, and the fifty-one negative cases as tests of the genuine oneness and of the proper one accord in this message. I consider the genuine oneness as our constitution, the proper one accord as our law, and the tests as cases of judgment. The case of the present rebellion in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should be judged according to our constitution (the genuine oneness), our law (the proper one accord), and the fifty-one cases for reference. If a just judgment were to be rendered, none of the fifty-one cases could be used as an example to judge any item of the dissenting ones&rsquo; accusations against us as a case that requires a quarantine. In contrast, there are cases on the list of tests that can be used as strong examples to judge our case against the dissenting ones as a case that needs a thorough quarantine.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO FACE<br />
THE PRESENT DIVISIVE SITUATION<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:15; 2 John 1-2; 3 John 3-4; Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10; 2 John 7-11; 1 Cor. 5:2, 11-13; 11:19; 4:1-5; 2 Cor. 5:10</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover the way to face the present divisive situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But before we do this, I would like to present to you a list of truths that can help us to clear up the dimmed vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE PRACTICAL TRUTHS<br />
VERSUS THE DISSENTING ACCUSATIONS</h2>
<p>In his withdrawal from the eldership of the church in Anaheim on March 19, 1989, Brother John Ingalls charged us with a number of accusations concerning our present situation. Hence, I have the burden to present to the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery some truths that will blow away the cloud that has dimmed the clear vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us, and will bring back to us a clear sky with a clear view in the recovery. These practical truths are versus some of John&rsquo;s dissenting accusations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
the Change of the Nature<br />
of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The nature of what we call the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has changed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of:</p>
<ol class="upper-alpha">
<li>The church ground of oneness versus division.</li>
<li>The church as the organic Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</li>
<li>The all-inclusive Christ as the mystery of God.</li>
<li>The life-giving and compound Spirit.</li>
<li>The divine life in Christ.</li>
<li>The divine revelation of the holy Word.</li>
</ol>
<p>These six items are the main contents of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and the nature of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should be the very nature of the elements of these items as the contents of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Whatever changes have been made in our practice up to the present time, not one of them can be considered as something that has caused the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to change in its nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;the Emphasizing<br />
of the Building Up of the Ministry<br />
More Than the Local Churches</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a change of emphasis to the building up of the work or the ministry more than the local churches...it seems that in the past years...there has been more emphasis on the churches being for the ministry. The ministry has been promoted, exalted, and built up, and the churches have suffered greatly in the process.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>The basic problem in the matter that John covers in this accusation concerns the understanding of the relationship between the ministry and the churches. Concerning the relationship between the ministry or the work and the churches, it has been our practice, from Brother Nee&rsquo;s time up to the present time, that whatever the ministry or the work does is absolutely for the churches. Even in the building up of the work or the ministry, the purpose and goal are for the churches. The initial purpose and final goal of our ministry or work are absolutely and utterly for the churches. We have received our ministry from the Lord with a definite commission, that is, to build up the churches as the organic Body of Christ. Whatever we do&mdash;preaching the gospel to save the sinners, feeding the new believers that they may grow, perfecting the saints that they may do the work that the gifted persons can do to build up the Body of Christ, teaching the word and expounding the Bible that the saints may be edified both in the truth and life, training the saints that they may be built up in the Lord&rsquo;s service and work, and even establishing the ministry or the work itself&mdash;is for the building up of the churches. Our history has fully proven this.</p>
<p>In such a practice as ours, we also stress that all the churches with all the saints should cooperate and be one with the ministry, so that the ministry will be strengthened and be more effective, that the churches with all the saints may benefit more in the ultimate goal for the Lord&rsquo;s interest, that is, to have His organic Body fully built up. In the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s ministry, such a coordination (fellowship) and oneness were rendered to him by the churches and the saints. The church in Philippi with all the saints there, and the church in Corinth and the churches in Galatia with the saints, all did this (Phil. 1:5; 4:16, 18; 1 Cor. 16:1-3). The apostle even praised this kind of fellowship as a &ldquo;good work&rdquo; begun by the Lord, and believed that the Lord would complete such a good work until the day of His appearing (Phil. 1:6). The thought in John&rsquo;s accusation concerning the relationship between the ministry and the churches with all the saints can only weaken the ministry in its work for the church and deprive the churches and the saints of their enjoyment of the benefit of the ministry&rsquo;s work. Without the cooperation of the churches and the saints, it would be difficult for the ministry to be strong and effective in its work, and without the churches with the saints being one with the ministry, it would be difficult for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to be prevailing in its spreading. To carry out the New Testament economy of God, the ministry, the churches, and the saints all must be one with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;a Great Effort<br />
and Promotion to Unite the Saints and<br />
the Churches around a Certain<br />
Leader and Organization</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a great effort and promotion to unite the saints and the churches around a certain leader and organization.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>This kind of great effort and promotion should be condemned. To unite the saints and the churches around a certain leader and organization is to build up a hierarchy. There has never been such a thing in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery from its beginning. However, this does not mean that there is no need for a proper leadership under the Lord that brings the divine revelation to the Lord&rsquo;s people and keeps the Lord&rsquo;s interest from suffering the damage of confusion. According to the New Testament revelation, in the church the elders take the lead (Heb. 13:24; Rom. 12:8), and in the ministry Peter took the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s work among the Jews (Gal. 2:7b), and Paul took the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s work among the Gentiles (Gal. 2:7a; Rom. 11:13). Without the proper leadership under the Lord, the kingdom of God on the earth today would become an anarchy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;the Pressuring<br />
of All the Saints and the Churches<br />
to Conform to the Ministry<br />
in Full Uniformity</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There has been much pressure with full expectation that all the saints and the churches will conform to the burden of the ministry and be identical with one another in full uniformity of practice, to carry it out.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>Surely, to have any kind of uniformity is wrong. However, to have intentional differences among the churches also is wrong. The problem lies in the matter of what vision we are under and what motive we have.</p><h2 class="head2">5. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;the Writing<br />
of the Letter by the Elders<br />
concerning the One Accord</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In February 1986 there was an elders&rsquo; training in Anaheim....At the end of that training, the brothers wrote a letter which, with perhaps two or three exceptions, we all signed....At the present time and for the past year and a half, we have regretted very much that we signed that letter, and even more, that such a letter was ever written. There is no precedent of that in the Word; furthermore there is no scriptural basis for the contents of such a letter. We agreed in that letter that we would be identical with all the churches, that we would follow the ministry absolutely, and that we realized Brother Lee&rsquo;s leading was indispensable to our oneness. Then, at the bottom of the letter we said that all these things were according to the teaching of the Word of God. But those things are not according to the teaching of the Word, and we regret very much that we subscribed to them. I want to state publicly and make it clear that I would retract my signature.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>The letter John referred to in this accusation is related to the one accord which I spoke about to the elders in February 1986. Now, John and some of those who are with him condemn the writing of that letter. Concerning such a matter, again I would say that it all depends on what vision he and some of those who are with him are under, what view they hold, and what motive they have. In principle, according to the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17 that all His believers would be one, the Lord is always pleased when we, the believers, are one in the things that are for His interest, and the Lord is surely offended if in anything that is for His interest we would not be one. At any rate, to be one is better than to be divided, than not to be one; to be in one accord is better than to be in confusion, in discord. Thank the Lord that those who would retract their signatures from the letter that John spoke about in the above paragraph are few, a small percentage of the more than four hundred who appreciate their signing of that letter. Some of the signers did express to me that they would like to keep that letter, with their signatures, for the sake of history.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;the Centralization<br />
of the Churches and the Work</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There has been quite an emphasis, at least in practice, on a kind of centralization of the churches and the work, which we also find contrary to the Word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is no such practice of a &ldquo;centralization of the churches&rdquo; and a &ldquo;centralization of the work.&rdquo; We do emphasize that all the churches should be one in the Body of Christ, not by the way of forming a federation but in the way of adequate fellowship in the Spirit in the organic union of the divine life. We also stress that the co-workers should not work independently but corporately under one leadership. It is clearly revealed in the New Testament that the co-workers among the Jews worked together corporately under the leadership of Peter, and the co-workers among the Gentiles worked corporately under the leadership of Paul. This does not mean that all the co-workers are centralized, but it does mean that the co-workers who are working in a certain region all work as one. This is the way to bring in the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. We do not practice any kind of centralization; we treasure only the proper oneness in the Spirit by the divine life, both of which unite us together organically, whether in the church life or in the work for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
a Pervasive Control over the Church</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a pervasive control exercised over the church. Now at least I can speak for Anaheim. I know this to be a fact, and I&rsquo;m in a position to know this. There has been much outside influence exercised upon the church which has made it very difficult to go on by getting our leading directly from the Lord. This control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>In this point John condemns &ldquo;a pervasive control exercised over the church.&rdquo; He also defines this control, saying that &ldquo;this control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings.&rdquo; Is there among us such &ldquo;a pervasive control exercised over the church,&rdquo; that is, a control that pervades all the churches? I would say here and now that there is no such thing! I do not exercise any control over any church, nor do I have any intention to do this. Here John has pointed out clearly that &ldquo;this control has not been exercised so much directly.&rdquo; This word of his indicates definitely that the pervasive control that he condemns is not one that is carried out directly by me or by anyone other than me, but &ldquo;very much indirectly,&rdquo; as he says, &ldquo;through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings.&rdquo; His clear word indicates that the means to carry out the indirect, pervasive control mentioned in his accusation are &ldquo;videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings.&rdquo; The videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings refer, no doubt, to the messages I have put out at different times and on different occasions. To say that through the messages that I gave I exercised a pervasive control over the church is not true. Whenever I gave a message, I never had the thought to control any church or anyone. In speaking for the Lord, I have only a sincere intention that through the Lord&rsquo;s word that I speak, sinners may be saved, saints may be edified and perfected, and the church may be built up for the carrying out of the New Testament economy of God. The thought of speaking for the Lord with an intention to exercise control over others is evil.</p>
<p>Here John says also, &ldquo;At least I can speak for Anaheim. I know this to be a fact, and I&rsquo;m in a position to know this.&rdquo; &ldquo;This&rdquo; must refer to the pervasive control that has been exercised &ldquo;very much indirectly through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings,&rdquo; as he indicated. The messages given by me in conferences, trainings, and elders&rsquo; meetings that were recorded on video were sent to all the churches, not only to the church in Anaheim. Hence, not only John, but all the elders of all the churches who have listened to my tapes are in a position to know this pervasive control. Do some of you brothers, who are the elders of the churches and who are present in this meeting, have the same kind of realization that John has&mdash;that I exercise a pervasive control over your churches indirectly through the messages on the videos?</p>
<p>My messages are always spoken with the Word of God as their base, structure, and element, which always conveys not only the divine revelation and the supply of the divine life, but also regulations, corrections, exhortations, and even reproofs (2 Tim. 3:16). How could John consider my messages, with such contents, a means that I use in order to exercise a pervasive control over the churches? If all the churches had the same kind of realization that John has, what would be left of the building up? This is a real devastation.</p>
<p>John also says, &ldquo;There has been much outside influence exercised upon the church.&rdquo; Since what was mentioned in his accusation was an &ldquo;influence,&rdquo; especially an &ldquo;outside&rdquo; influence, it should not refer to anything within but to something outside the church that was under his care. Even if there were such an outside influence, such an outside influence should not be considered as a control that I exercised over the church under his care.</p>
<p>John went further to say that this outside influence &ldquo;has made it very difficult to go on by getting our leading directly from the Lord.&rdquo; In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we work and serve in the Body of Christ. So, in our work and service to the Lord, we are related both to the Lord as our Head and to the ones who work and serve together with us as fellow members of the Lord&rsquo;s Body. Hence, the New Testament teaches us to be subject not only to the Lord but also to one another in the fear of the Lord (Eph. 5:24a, 21). Thus, in the Lord&rsquo;s work and service, in the matter of &ldquo;getting our leading directly from the Lord,&rdquo; we need to consider our relationship with the ones who work and serve together with us. It is hardly possible for us to receive a leading directly from the Lord without taking care of the ones with whom we work and serve. If we get our leading directly from the Lord without considering the fellow members of the Lord&rsquo;s Body who are laboring with us, we will surely jeopardize the oneness of the Body. We constantly need the cooperation and the coordination to keep us in a balanced situation in which we take care not only of the Lord&rsquo;s leading directly but also of the co-working ones&rsquo; realization. On the other hand, when we take care of the co-working ones&rsquo; realization, we should also seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading directly. This way of balance is the safe way and the proper way to save us from being independent, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and to keep the oneness of the Body so that the Body can be built up without the suffering of any loss.</p><h2 class="head2">8. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
the Training Center and the Affiliation<br />
under One Leadership</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Church history reveals that in the history of one denomination after another, not all started as a denomination....The Lord did something among His people in a fresh way, with His presence and blessing. But after the saints in that group multiplied and other groups were formed, they all agreed together and decided to affiliate in order to preserve what they had received. The second thing they did again and again was to start a training center, a Bible School, or a Seminary to educate their people in the truth they had received. From there on out, it was a full-blown denomination. The first step is affiliation under one leadership; the second is some sort of training center. That is the way group after group has gone, and...we are also going that way.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>We have never had a training center to &ldquo;educate&rdquo; our people as &ldquo;a Bible School, or a Seminary&rdquo; do. Our training is to train mainly the young saints to grow in the divine life and in the divine truth, to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God, to feed the lambs of the Lord, to perfect the saints, and to build up the organic Body of Christ. We never had the intention to &ldquo;educate&rdquo; our people in a system of belief, in a kind of creed that will lead to the formation of a &ldquo;full-blown denomination&rdquo;; neither have we ever affiliated the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery &ldquo;under one leadership.&rdquo; We have never had any kind of &ldquo;affiliation.&rdquo; What we stress, according to the divine revelation in the holy Word, is the unique oneness both in the church as the organic Body of Christ and in the work to carry out the unique New Testament ministry. For keeping such a oneness according to the heart&rsquo;s desire of the Lord and according to the attributes of oneness that characterize the Body of Christ with the elements of the Divine Trinity (Eph. 4:3-6), there is the need of the proper leadership of the elders in the church life and the genuine leadership of the ministers in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. This is our real practice.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
Exalting Brother Lee above What Is Written</h2>
<p>&ldquo;...he [Brother Lee] has been exalted and honored above what is written, according to 1 Corinthians 4:6....We repent of having ourselves taken part in this. One of the brothers said to me at one time, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to put a sign up outside the meeting hall here&mdash;The Local Church of Witness Lee.&rsquo; I would hate that there would be in reality any such thing, but there has been a strong tendency toward this. The church should not be the church of anyone but Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>Thank the Lord that, by His grace, the ministry that He has given me has been greatly blessed by Him in the past years. Because of this, in all the years a certain regard has been rendered to me by the dear saints. But compared with the regard that the ancient saints rendered to the Apostle Paul because of his excellent ministry, the regard that I have received from the saints is much less. Paul was never accused of being overly regarded throughout the past centuries. No one ever said that he was &ldquo;exalted and honored above what is written, according to 1 Corinthians 4:6.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
Brother Lee and His Ministry Having Been<br />
Made a Great Issue and Factor of Division</h2>
<p>&ldquo;...A spiritual leader should never be made an issue or a factor of division, but Brother Lee and his ministry have been made a great issue and factor of division among us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>The first clause of John&rsquo;s word here indicates that he admits that there are spiritual leaders, but the second clause makes an accusation regarding a matter that does not exist. There has never been a &ldquo;division among us&rdquo; that was made with me and my ministry as &ldquo;a great issue and factor.&rdquo; The intention of John, and of those who are for him, in trying to put my ministry aside is the real issue and factor of the division among us.</p><h2 class="head2">11. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;the Relationship<br />
with the Saints and with the Church Being<br />
Made to Depend on the Relationship<br />
to Brother Lee</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In Matthew 22 the Lord...asked...the question...,&lsquo;What do you think of Christ?...&rsquo;Everyone has to answer that question....But I&rsquo;m afraid, that question has been changed among us to read this way&mdash;&lsquo;What do you think of Witness Lee? What is your relationship to him?&rsquo;...Such a question should never become an issue or factor among us, so that our going on or our relationship with the saints and with the church is made to depend on our relationship to him. But this has been the case.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>John said that &ldquo;our going on or our relationship with the saints and with the church is made to depend on our relationship to him [Witness Lee].&rdquo; A servant of the Lord who ministers the word of God to the saints is very much related to the saints, and the saints are very much related to him. Hence, such a relationship is not only right but also needed. Therefore, the saints&rsquo; &ldquo;going on&rdquo; and their relationship with each other and with the church should depend on their relationship to the one who ministers the word of God to them. This also is needed. If there were not such a thing, the church could not be healthy and would be left in a miserable state.</p>
<h2 class="head2">12. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
the Application of the Church Ground<br />
in a Divisive and Sectarian Way</h2>
<p>&ldquo;...We have...applied this teaching [concerning the ground of oneness] in a divisive and sectarian way, so that we divide ourselves from other Christians. This is due to an improper attitude and application of the truth....I feel that in the local churches we have become very narrow and small; narrow in view, in our outlook, and in our reception of other saints....&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>To take the ground of oneness requires us to be separated from divisive and sectarian Christians, because they are on a divisive and sectarian ground. This does not mean that we are divisive and sectarian. We are standing on the ground of oneness; they are remaining on the ground of division. Thus, the taking of the ground of oneness should not be condemned as &ldquo;an improper attitude and application of the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, our taking of the ground of oneness surely makes us &ldquo;narrow and small,&rdquo; because the majority of Christians are taking the broad way and the way of greatness, which we would not take in following Jesus today on this earth outside the camp, bearing His reproach (Heb. 13:13). However, this does not mean that we are &ldquo;narrow in view.&rdquo; By standing on the ground of oneness, our view has been very much broadened to be the broad view that the Head, Christ, holds over His entire Body universally. And &ldquo;in our reception of other saints&rdquo; we are absolutely not narrow; rather, we are as broad as the Lord is in this matter, because we receive, as the Lord and God do (Rom. 14:3; 15:7), every kind of genuine Christian who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ. Our hearts are for them, and our arms and bosom are open to them. Yet regardless of how broad our view is in the receiving of other saints, the majority of the saints will not come to us, because they prefer, and some insist, to remain in their denominations or divisive groups, not having the broad view to care for the whole Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">13. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
Our Attitude toward Other Christians</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Our attitude toward other Christians is one of belittling them and thinking we&rsquo;re superior to them. I don&rsquo;t know how many times we&rsquo;ve heard this expression, &lsquo;Poor Christianity!&rsquo; We say that we&rsquo;re speaking only of the system, not of the people, but our attitude has definitely spilled over to the people....&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>Concerning John&rsquo;s accusation in this item, we must distinguish Christianity from the Christians and the genuine church that is according to the divine revelation of the New Testament. In Matthew 13 the Lord Jesus showed us clearly in His parables the difference between the wheat (the real Christians) and the tares (the nominal Christians), the difference between meal (fine flour&mdash;Christ as food to God and men) and leaven (evil things such as heresies, false teachings, and evil practices), the difference between the mustard seed (Christ as the seed of life) and a big tree (the abnormal development of the church&mdash;Christianity), and the difference between the tares, leaven, and the abnormally developed tree, and the treasure hidden in the field (the kingdom of the heavens) and the pearl of great value (the genuine church). The nominal Christians, the heresies, the evil practices, and the abnormal development have transmuted the church, which is composed of the genuine Christians and Christ as the seed of life and the spiritual food to be the precious pearl and the hidden treasure, into Christianity, which is not acceptable to God. Today, for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must realize the difference between the genuine church, composed of the real Christians, and the abnormal Christianity. When we say &ldquo;Poor Christianity!&rdquo; we refer to the abnormal Christianity, with no intention of belittling or despising any real Christian. We do recognize real Christians as our beloved brothers and sisters in Christ and respect those among them who are seeking the Lord and His kingdom. However, we cannot justify the very Christianity of which they are members and for which they work. Hence, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, quite often in teaching the saints we must present the truth concerning the genuine church of the Lord as His organic Body by pointing out the poor situation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. We prefer to speak about others in a positive way, but in today&rsquo;s abnormal situation we simply cannot avoid pointing out the abnormality that exists among Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">14. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;<br />
an Overstressing and Distortion of the Teaching<br />
concerning Deputy Authority</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There has been to some extent an atmosphere of fear brought in among the saints and among the churches, bringing the conscience of the saints into bondage. I believe this has been done by an over-stressing and distortion of the teaching concerning deputy authority. This has brought the saints into a condition where they are fearful to follow their conscience, to be one with their spirit, and sometimes to speak their genuine concerns.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>John&rsquo;s word here is an accusation against the teaching of deputy authority in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. According to the divine revelation in the holy Word, there is deputy authority in God&rsquo;s economy, both in the Old Testament, such as with Moses and the priests who taught the people the divine oracle, and in the New Testament, such as with the elders, who take care of the church (1 Tim. 3:5; 5:17; Heb. 13:17), and the apostles, who establish the churches and teach the saints (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10; 1 Cor. 4:21). A local church is under the authority of Christ as the Head, represented by the elders. Hence, the saints in a local church should obey the elders (Heb. 13:17). The churches as the Body of Christ are under their Head, Christ, represented by the apostles. Hence, the churches should obey the apostles (2 Cor. 2:9; 7:15; 10:6). To obey the elders in a local church and to obey the apostles among the churches does not mean that the obeying one does not need to obey the Lord directly. When he is seeking the leading directly from the Lord, he should also take care of the elders in the local church, because he is living and working in the church as a part of the Body. When the churches are seeking the leading directly from the Lord, they should also take care of the apostles, because they are all living and working with the apostles in the churches as the Body of Christ. Whether in a local church or among all the churches, we should be Body-conscious, taking care not only of the Head but also of His Body. Since we are living and working in the Body, we have the Body with the Head. We cannot have the Head without the Body; neither can we have the Body without the Head. We should seek to obey the Head with a relationship to the Body, and we should also seek to obey the Body with a relationship to the Head. We all need to realize that in our natural life we are very independent. So, to take care of obeying both the Lord and the elders or the apostles at the same time is not an easy thing for us. Hence, we may unconsciously feel that the teaching concerning the obeying of God&rsquo;s deputy authority is overly stressed or even unscriptural. In any case, to say that there is no deputy authority of the Lord is surely unscriptural.</p>
<p>The fear within those who are not willing to obey the elders in a local church or the apostles in the churches might, according to their feeling, bring their conscience into bondage. Any kind of fear that causes the saints to feel bound in their conscience and not free to do whatever they feel led of the Lord is not needed or healthy. Such a fear might be due to the saints&rsquo; independence, or to their unwillingness to be one with the elders, or to their holding of a view concerning the church life which is different from the view held generally by the church. If it is due to the saints&rsquo; independence, then the saints need to learn how to live the Body life; if it is due to the saints&rsquo; unwillingness to be one with the elders, then they need to learn more concerning how to be in one accord with the elders in the church life; if they are holding a different view than the church&rsquo;s view, then they need to learn more lessons that they may go along with the church or the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Regardless of what the fear is due to, it is always better to obey the elders in a church or the apostles among the churches at the same time as one obeys the Lord, rather than to obey only the Lord without caring for the elders in the church or the apostles among the churches. All the saints need to be ushered into a Body-consciousness and to be helped to pay the price of the giving up of their independence, their freedom to be different, and their subjective view, so that the Body of Christ can be built up in the Lord&rsquo;s way.</p><h2 class="head2">15. The Dissenting Accusation&mdash;the Emphasizing<br />
of Methods More Than the Inner Anointing,<br />
and External Big Success More Than<br />
the Experience of the Inner Life</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There has been too much emphasizing of methods more than the inner anointing, and external big success more than the experience of the inner life. This is surely a deviation from the central lane of God&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Truth</h2>
<p>Yes, we do need the inner anointing and the experience of the inner life. However, if we lack the proper external methods to match the inner anointing, and an adequate external success in fruit bearing to encourage the experience of the inner life, and we emphasize the inner anointing without the adequate methods with which to labor, and the experience of the inner life without the success of fruit bearing, we will not have the capable way to carry out God&rsquo;s economy in the central lane. Such a situation would be a real abuse of the central lane in God&rsquo;s economy. No one should put forth the accusation that to emphasize the necessary methods that we may work prevailingly through the inner anointing and to emphasize a satisfactory success that we may be encouraged to seek more experience of the inner life are a &ldquo;deviation from the central lane of God&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo; To abide in the vine is a matter of the inner life, and it is for fruit bearing. If the abiding does not issue in fruit bearing but in barrenness, such an abiding should be condemned as an abusing of the inner life of the vine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE WAY TO FACE THE DIVISIVE SITUATION</h2>
<p>Based on our study concerning the genuine oneness, the proper one accord, and the tests of these two matters, and based on the listing of some practical truths versus some dissenting accusations, we can come to consider the way to face the present divisive situation among us. This way can be considered a scriptural remedy to meet our present need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To Pay Full Attention to the Truth<br />
concerning the Church as the Body of Christ<br />
and as the House and Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>To face the present divisive situation, we need to pay our full attention to the truth concerning the church as the Body of Christ and as the house and kingdom of God. First Timothy 3:15 tells us that the church is the pillar and base of the truth. Thus, we must help the saints to have the full knowledge concerning these matters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. To Keep the Truth at Any Cost</h2>
<p>In 2 John 1-2 and in 3 John 3-4, the aged Apostle John was happy to know that his children kept the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. To Exercise to Quarantine</h2>
<p>I do feel that all the churches must do something to help the saints to know the real situation in the recovery. The saints must be helped to realize that a &ldquo;contagious disease&rdquo; is now among us, and, as in the field of medicine, we must quarantine the diseased ones. To quarantine does not mean that we do not love those who are &ldquo;ill,&rdquo; nor does it mean that we cut them off. It means that we do something to preserve both the contagious ones and the rest of the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Divisive Ones</h2>
<p>According to Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10, we need to exercise to quarantine the divisive ones. Romans 16:17 charges us to turn away from those who make divisions. To turn away from them is to exercise to quarantine them. Titus 3:10 says that we should refuse a factious (sectarian, divisive) person after a first and second admonition. To refuse such a one also is to exercise to quarantine him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Heretical Ones</h2>
<p>We also need to quarantine the heretical ones, those who go beyond the teaching concerning Christ (2 John 7-11). According to 2 John 10, we should not receive such persons into our home, and even we should not greet them. This also is to quarantine them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Fornicators</h2>
<p>In addition, according to 1 Corinthians 5:2, 11-13, we need to quarantine the fornicators, who live in such a gross sin, by removing them from the fellowship of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">III. A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Divisions Testing<br />
and Approving the Believers</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 11:19 says that divisions are unavoidable that the approved ones might be made manifest. The kind of turmoil and rebellion that we are now experiencing always sifts the congregation. In such a situation, some are sifted and some are manifested as being approved.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Not a Matter of Being Right or Wrong<br />
but a Matter of Keeping or Not Keeping<br />
the Oneness</h2>
<p>Most people pay their attention to the matter of being right or wrong. However, in today&rsquo;s situation, it is not a matter of right or wrong; it is a matter of whether we are divisive or not.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. To Remain Neutral<br />
Not Being Good for the Building Up<br />
but for the Destruction of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Being neutral does not build up (2 Cor. 13:8, 10) but destroys the Body of Christ. Being neutral may come out of a good heart, but it is the wrong way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. To Keep the Truth Needing<br />
the Overcoming of Personal Affection</h2>
<p>To keep the truth, we need to overcome personal affection with the vow of a Nazarite. In Numbers 6:6-7, the Nazarites were charged not to be contaminated by any kind of death, even by the death of their blood relatives. Therefore, we must be careful about anyone who is &ldquo;dying&rdquo; or who is spreading death. If we realize that one who is near us is &ldquo;dying&rdquo; or is spreading death, we must keep ourselves away. Otherwise, if we remain near such a person, we will be contaminated by the germs of death. This will nullify our vow, and we will have to begin our vow over again (Num. 6:9-12). In some cases, to avoid the contagion of death, we need to overcome our personal affection, especially for those with whom we are well-acquainted. Leviticus 10:6-7, Exodus 32:25-29, and Deuteronomy 33:8-9 all stress the need of the overcoming of our personal affection in the service of our priesthood. Both Exodus 32:25-29 and Deuteronomy 33:8-9 tell us that when the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, offending the Lord to the uttermost, Moses spoke the word asking all the Levites to kill their relatives and those who were close to them. They obeyed, and as a result they obtained the priesthood. The Urim and Thummin were with them, meaning that they had the revelation; they had the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s oracle because of their faithfulness to God&rsquo;s person. God hates to see His people worship anyone besides Him. So, He demands that His faithful people &ldquo;kill&rdquo; all the idol worshippers. One of these worshippers might be our father, and one might be our sister. In order to be faithful to the Lord, we must overcome our personal affection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Lord&rsquo;s Recovery<br />
Being Not Only through Life,<br />
but Even the More of the Truth</h2>
<p>At such a time as this, we need to stress not only the matter of life but also the matter of truth (1 Tim. 3:15). We need to stress the truth concerning the Body and concerning the church ground.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. To Walk in the Light<br />
of the Judgment Seat of Christ</h2>
<p>We need to remember that whatever we do and whatever we say will be judged by the Lord&rsquo;s coming back at His judgment seat (1 Cor. 4:1-5; 2 Cor. 5:10). Paul was strongly criticized. In such a situation he was forced to say that he did not judge himself, nor did he justify himself; rather, he was waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s judgment at His coming back (1 Cor. 4:3-5). We must walk in this kind of light. It is not just a matter of what we are today. Whatever we are today affects what we will be in the future.</p>
<p>Even the Apostle Paul was greatly criticized; hence, we should not be disappointed if we are criticized, defamed, and slandered. We ourselves must exercise to have a conscience void of offense (Acts 24:16).</p></body></html>
