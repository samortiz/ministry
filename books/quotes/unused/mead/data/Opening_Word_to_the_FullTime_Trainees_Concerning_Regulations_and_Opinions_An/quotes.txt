[2]  AN OPENING WORD TO THE FULL-TIME TRAINEES CONCERNING REGULATIONS AND OPINIONS MESSAGE ONE LIFE GROWS BY REGULATION TOWARD MATURITY AND FUNCTION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:6; Eph 4:15; Col 2:19; Matt 25:1-4, 24-27 GROWTH IN LIFE BY REGULATION
[3]  In this message I am burdened to share something with you concerning the matter of life.
[4]  The life we are concerned with is the divine life mingled with our human life.
[5]  Thus, we can see that in the universe there are three lives in God's creation, and there is one life which is the uncreated life, the divine life.
[6]  The Bible shows that the plant life is for the animal life; both of these lives are for the human life, and the human life is for the divine life.
[7]  Our spiritual life, the divine life, zoe, should grow.
[8]  It does not need to grow in God, but it does need to grow in us.
[9]  But when this life is mingled with our life, this mingled life needs to grow.
[10]  Luke 2 tells us clearly that Jesus grew not in the divine life but in the human life v. 52 . Today we are growing spiritually, not in the human life but in the divine life.
[11]  In this mingling we need to grow with the divine life into the Head, and this divine life is God Himself.
[12]  The full-time training is the top and strictest teaching.
[13]  We Christians who want to serve the Lord need this kind of teaching, this kind of training, this kind of regulation.
[14]  This growth by regulation has a goal, and this goal is maturity and function.
[15]  We are cooperating with our God that He may give you more growth, that He may give you the maturity you need.
[16]  AN OPENING WORD TO THE FULL-TIME TRAINEES CONCERNING REGULATIONS AND OPINIONS MESSAGE TWO OLDNESS AND OPINIONS VERSUS REVELATION AND OBEDIENCE Scripture Reading: Acts 10:9-16; 18:24-28; 19:1-5; 1 Cor 16:12; Acts 15:36-41
[17]  In the previous message, we saw that life grows by regulation toward maturity and function.
[18]  We all have to realize that the proper regulation comes from revelation, and this kind of regulation that comes from revelation always brings us into the proper obedience.
[19]  Another trouble arose later in the church because the Jews tried to bring in the practice of circumcision to the Gentile churches.
[20]  THE NEED TO DEAL WITH OUR OPINIONS AND OLDNESS
[21]  One major thing which shows you that you are not opinionated is that you simply follow the brothers.
[22]  When I was young, I read a story about a father and a boy with a donkey.
