   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. With a Soul, the Issue of</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Spirit Being Added to Our Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The soul is not a substance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is an issue of two substances coming together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the breath of God came into the body of dust, an issue came out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This issue is our soul as our self in between our body and our spirit Gen 2:7c; Luke 9:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more that we experience the spiritual life and enjoy God, the more we realize this matter of our soul being between our body and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether we are for the body or for the spirit depends upon what we let our soul do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us suppose you have a choice between two things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One thing would cause you to lose your temper, but the other thing would cause you to praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Which thing would you welcome?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is up to the decision of your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the evening you may have the choice between two things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You can either go to the church meeting or stay home and watch television.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Which would you choose?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that juncture it is very clear that going to the meeting is the spirit's intention, whereas staying home to watch television is the fleshly desire of your fallen body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows that the soul is between our body and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Day by day we are confronted with things and situations in which we must decide whether to follow our fallen body or our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes we may have a choice between making a telephone call or making a "call to the heavens" to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may be addicted to gossiping with someone who is our friend.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of talk is in our soul with our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The desire to make a call to the heavens, to talk to the Lord, is of the Spirit and in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Quite often, however, we may choose to make phone calls instead of calling to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we make vain phone calls, our spirit will be deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we do this, we should confess, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today I disobeyed You in making many calls that were not according to You.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, I realize that those telephone calls were of the flesh and selected by my soul."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These illustrations show that the soul is between the spirit and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OUR SPIRIT BEING PARTICULARLY CREATED</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BY GOD AS OUR PARTICULAR ORGAN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Genesis 2:7, a short verse of the Bible, gives us three points.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, God made man with the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Third, a living soul, a human being, came out as an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The making of the body and the issue of the soul were not as important as the producing of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most crucial thing was the producing of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we had only a soul with a body, we would be like the beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Most people live by the soul with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The newspapers always give reports of people who are involved in evil things such as robbery, stealing, fornication, divorce, and murder.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are people who are living by their soul with their body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should endeavor to live by our spirit with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should deny our ugly, contaminated soul and reject our dirty, fallen body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible tells us to deny the soul because it has been corrupted Matt 16:24-26; Luke 9:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day when Peter was talking to the Lord, Satan came out of him, even through his loving of the Lord Matt 16:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The soul is ugly, and we should hate it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The body is dirty, and we should reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We Christians who are under God's teaching should always endeavor to live by our spirit with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is in our spirit that we have the real rest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are different than most people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While they live by their soul with their body, we live by our spirit with the Spirit.</S>
