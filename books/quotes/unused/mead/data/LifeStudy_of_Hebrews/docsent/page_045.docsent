   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FOURTEEN HOLY BROTHERS AND PARTAKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE HEAVENLY CALLING I. HOLY BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to Hebrews 3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This chapter opens in this way: Wherefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I like these two titles holy brothers and partakers of a heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No other book in the New Testament calls us holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The title holy brothers implies two main points that we are holy and that we are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not only brothers but holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you dare to say that you are a holy brother?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The writer of this book could not call us holy brothers until he had covered so many of the qualifications concerning both Christ and us in the first two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By the time he reaches the third chapter, he is able to call us holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through His death and resurrection Christ has made us His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Originally, we were sinners, death victims, prisoners, and captives.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Praise Him that His death has made propitiation for our sins and has released us from the slavery of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His resurrection we were produced as His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So now we can be called holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter two we see that the brothers brought forth in the Lord s resurrection are in the process of being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we are holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not merely sinlessly perfect; we are divinely holy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1:9 we see our relationship with God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That verse, which is addressed to Christ, says, Your God has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The King James Version renders the Greek word for partners as companions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But a partner is better than a companion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may be companions without being partners, but if we are partners, we certainly are companions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In God s economy, Christ is the One whom God has appointed to accomplish His plan, and we are Christ s partners in the divine interest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was anointed by God, and we share His anointing for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is the Heir appointed by God, and in 1:9 we see that this appointed Heir has been anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The anointing confirms the appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Firstly, God appointed the Son and then He anointed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As Christ s partners we all partake of His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are partners of God s anointed One and we share His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a part of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is included in the full gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people talk about the full gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The full gospel includes our partnership with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This wonderful item is included in the full gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all need to see that we are partners of Christ and that we share in His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of this, by the time we reach 3:1, we have all that we need to be holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have the standing, the qualifications, the reality, the life, the nature, the source, and all that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are now the holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you knew that you were such a holy brother, what would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Would you still smoke cigarettes?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever I see a brother smoking cigarettes, my whole being goes down.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I say to myself, Oh brother, you have just sold your birthright for a cheaper price than Esau did.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can a holy brother still smoke cigarettes?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we have no regulations or legality, we do have our majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not only holy; we are majestic.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consider our position; we are the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God and we are the partners of God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you were a brother of the president of the United States, you would be very proud and have a certain amount of majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But whose brother are you?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are a brother of the Firstborn Son of God and a partner of God s anointed One for the fulfilling of God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Smoking is an insult to God s anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yes, the Bible never says that you should not smoke, and the New Testament is not a book of laws but a book of holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nevertheless, I believe that if the Lord would open your eyes and impress you with this marvelous item in the full gospel, you would be another person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You would be more than open for our High Priest to minister Himself into you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This would change your taste.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Never again would cigarettes be tasteful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such a vision would change our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today the preaching of the gospel is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As we preach the gospel, we should not only tell people that they are sinners, that they are condemned, and that they are going to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to preach the gospel in a much higher way, telling people that God is calling them to believe in His Firstborn Son that they might become His brothers, even His partners in fulfilling God s eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is the need for such preaching today.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I hope that some of the young brothers will be burdened to do this kind of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not want to hear the preaching of the gospel with the same old tune that tells people that they are sinners and are going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not wrong, but it is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to preach the gospel from Hebrews 3:1, telling the sinners how they can be converted and transformed into holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the young people preach this gospel, many of their schoolmates will be attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>More than thirty-nine years ago, when I was still young, I stayed for a while in Peking, the old capital of China.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Peking there was an outstanding hospital that was sponsored and supplied by the Rockefeller Foundation called Peking Union Medical College.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It was a great hospital with the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many of the nurses who worked in that hospital were caught for the church, and some of the doctors were also caught by the higher preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They were all on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need this kind of preaching today.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I am burdened because I have seen something higher.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I want to see people get something better.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not preach the gospel in a low way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What is the center, the high point of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Is it to take a poor sinner, sprinkle some drops of blood on him, and send him to heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do you think that God s gospel only does this much?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No, it is much higher than this.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God s gospel is to make people holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is not my concept; it is the concept revealed in the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In His resurrection, Christ has made all of us His brothers and He has come into us to declare the Father to us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now, as the Sanctifier, He is qualified to perform the sanctifying work that makes us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are His holy brothers and His partners, sharing His anointing for the fulfilling of God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Is this not in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Is it not the good news?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The world needs to hear these glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Many thoughtful people in the leading universities throughout the country are wondering about the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>So many are asking themselves, What is the purpose of life?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What will happen after my graduation?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>No one in the universities can tell them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must go and tell them the real meaning of life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Go and tell them that they can be the holy brothers of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If the Lord delays His coming back, I hope that after a few years this kind of preaching will be prevailing in all the universities in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The United States, Europe, and all the leading countries need to hear the higher preaching of such a full gospel, the gospel that produces holy brothers of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If the young people will take up this burden and go to the campuses preaching this gospel, a good number of thoughtful young people will be caught.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I hope that many of you reading this message will make a deal with the Lord, telling Him that you are willing to be burdened for the preaching of the high gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If you are burdened to preach the high gospel, I believe that the Lord will honor your preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Lord, we need more young preachers, more preachers of the fullest gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Before we go on, I would like to have some fellowship with the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I have been fully captured by the Lord and I know what I am doing here.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I have seen the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In the whole universe there is nothing higher than this.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I am doing the most glorious work among the humankind, and you all must do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is why I do not care for the department stores they are too low.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I would never trade what I have in my hands for anything in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>What I have is too high and too glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Today s world needs a crusade with the preaching of the highest and fullest gospel.</S>
