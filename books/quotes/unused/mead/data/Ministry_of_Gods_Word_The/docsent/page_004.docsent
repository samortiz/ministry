   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTERS OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is another kind of minister of the word in the New Testament the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ministry of the word in the Old Testament was completely objective.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ministry of the word in the Lord Jesus was completely subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Old Testament the ministry of the word was realized when the word came upon a man and the man s voice was used as a carrier.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Lord Jesus the ministry of the word was not through the visitation of the word but through the embodiment of the word as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word took on not only the human voice but human thoughts, feelings, and opinions as well.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything that belonged to this man was being employed by the word, because every aspect of this man was in harmony with God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This man is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we come to the apostles in the New Testament ministry of the word, we find a ministry with the same nature as that of the ministry of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also find the element of the Old Testament revelation mingled with the nature of the Lord Jesus ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The difference between the New Testament ministry of the word and the Lord s ministry of the word is this: In the case of the Lord Jesus, who was God s word becoming flesh, first there was God s word and then there was flesh to match this word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All of the feelings, thoughts, and consciousness of this man were in harmony with God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the case of the New Testament ministry of the word, however, first there is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all have the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order for this flesh to become a minister of the word, it has to be transformed to match the requirement of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of the flesh have to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The flesh has to match God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we can say that the New Testament ministry of the word is different from both its Old Testament counterpart and from the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus ministry was one hundred percent subjective; He Himself was the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament ministry, on the other hand, is the ministry of the prophets plus the ministry of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is the visitation of God s word, the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But there are also human feelings, thoughts, and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Collectively, we can call these aspects the human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament ministry of the word is divine revelation plus human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Men chosen by God in the New Testament are different from the Lord Jesus, who is God s holy thing Luke 1:35 and God s Holy One.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Him there is not a hint of any mixture; His word was God s very word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the men chosen by God in the New Testament, we have a different story.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition to depositing His word into their being, God had to deal with the persons themselves; He had to build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, God put His word into such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, He dealt with them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God used their thoughts, feelings, and characteristics, yet at the same time He dealt with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God dealt with the New Testament ministers of the word in their experience, speaking, feeling, thoughts, opinions, and characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He dealt with them before He used them to express His word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A New Testament minister of the word not only has God s word and not only releases God s word with his human voice but expresses God s word through his human life in its full dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is pleased to put His word into a man and to allow such a man to express His word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus is the word becoming the flesh, while the New Testament ministers are those who express the word in a flesh that has been dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>HUMAN ELEMENTS WITHIN DIVINE INSPIRATION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some presume that no human element can ever be contained in divine inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They think that once the human element is involved, the divine inspiration is no longer divine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who think this way do not understand the nature of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s inspiration does contain human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In fact, His word is expressed through human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the human elements in the prophetic ministry of the Old Testament were minimal, one cannot say that they were completely absent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the least God used the human mouth to convey His message.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus was the Word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the human elements within Him were God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today in the New Testament age, God secures ministers of His word by expressing His word through human beings with human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If one reads the New Testament carefully, it is clear that Paul frequently used words that Peter never used.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John used some words that Matthew never used.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some words are found only in Luke s writings, while others are found only in Mark s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In studying the Bible, we find that every writer has his special characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Gospel of Matthew is different from the Gospel of Mark, and the Gospel of Mark is different from the Gospel of Luke or the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul s Epistles were written in one style, while Peter s Epistles were written in another style.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John s Gospel and Epistles contain the same subject; they are related.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For example, the first sentence of the Gospel of John says, In the beginning....</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first sentence of his first Epistle says, That which was from the beginning....</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One speaks of the beginning, and the other speaks of that which was from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The book of Revelation, which was also written by John, echoes his Gospel and Epistles and contains the same style.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moreover, we can observe that every writer uses idiomatic expressions which are distinctly his own.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Luke was a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In describing sicknesses, he freely used medical terms.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The other three writers of the Gospels only described these ailments in general terms.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The book of Acts was written by Luke as well, and we find the same free use of medical terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every Gospel has distinctive terminologies and themes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, Mark is unique in its use of the word immediately, Matthew, in the use of the phrase the kingdom of the heavens, and Luke, in the use of the phrase the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All these are unique characteristics of the writers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every book of the Bible is impregnated with the marks of its writer, yet every book remains very much the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The New Testament is full of human elements, yet it is all God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every writer has his own style, expression, and characteristic, and God uses these characteristics to express His word through them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His word is not damaged by this process.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are human marks and human characteristics, yet it is still God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the ministry of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the New Testament ministry God entrusts His word to man, and He uses man s very own elements to express His word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He does not make man a tape recorder, recording His speaking verbatim and then playing it back objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God does not want to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord Jesus has come, and the Holy Spirit has carried out His work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The goal of His work is to keep the human elements and yet at the same time not damage the divine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the foundation of the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Holy Spirit modulates, regulates, and operates on man to the degree that his elements remain, yet God s word is not sacrificed; rather, it is complemented.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If God s word is void of human elements, it means that man has become a tape recorder.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today God s word contains human elements and is, in fact, complemented by human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We know that speaking in tongues is a gift from God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, Paul did not encourage everyone to speak in tongues in the meeting, because when a man speaks in tongues, his mind is unfruitful 1 Cor 14:14, 27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In other words, the human mind is not involved.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is more in the principle of the Old Testament ministry; it is different from the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When a man speaks in tongues, his mouth conveys an unintelligible, divine utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But God wants human elements in His New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>By the restriction, regulation, and operation of the Holy Spirit, everything of man can be used by God, and God can release His word through man.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is truly God s word, yet at the same time it is full of human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A New Testament minister of God s word must be possessed by God to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Consider the example of a musician.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He may be very skillful with the piano, organ, and violin.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He can play the same tune on different instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Every instrument has its own characteristics, and the music it produces bears distinctive characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>A man can tell whether the sound is from a piano or a violin.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The tune is the same, but the sounds are different.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Every instrument bears its own distinctive sound quality.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The piano has its own quality, as do the organ and the violin.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Every instrument is different, yet all the characteristics added together bring out the sentiments and ethos of the music.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There is an analogy between this and the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Some are like the piano, while others are like the organ or violin.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The tune may be the same, but different sounds are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>One man releases God s word, and we find his own human elements in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Another man releases God s word, and we find his own human elements in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Everyone whom God uses has his own human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Under the regulation, direction, and perfection of the Holy Spirit, the human elements do not become a hindrance to God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Instead, they glorify it in the process of releasing it.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Since God s word must pass through man and must pick up the human elements, those who have never experienced God s dealing cannot expect their human elements to be of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If a man s own elements are questionable to God, God cannot release His word through such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Such a one cannot serve as a minister of God s word, and God cannot use him.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In the Old Testament God used a donkey to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This, however, is the age of the New Testament, and the New Testament ministry of the word is different from that of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In the New Testament God s word is expressed through human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is why God is very selective; He decides whom He can use and whom He cannot use.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If our human elements are not properly dealt with, we cannot be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We do not have the option of conveying God s word like a tape recorder.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>God needs to see changes in us.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If we cannot come up to God s standard, He cannot use us.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we want to be a channel of God s word, we need much calibration and adjustment.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If God set aside our human elements, it would be a simple matter to convey His word.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But God wants the human elements, and the very persons whom He will use become a big issue.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Some human elements are contaminated with defilement, carnality, and traces of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>God cannot use these; He has to put them aside.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Some people have never been broken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Others have a mind that is full of crooked guile.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Some argue with God, while others are never dealt with in their mind or their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>They remain stiff-necked.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>God s word can never be released through these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Even if they receive God s word, they cannot pass it on.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Even if they force themselves to pass it on, they will not be able to do so effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The basic consideration of a New Testament minister of God s word is his very condition before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Today God does not want His word to remain His word alone; He wants His word to be spoken through man s mouth in a way that it is seen as man s word.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>What God wants is a word that is truly divine yet at the same time human.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>In reading the New Testament, can we find one word that was not written down by man?</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The outstanding characteristic of the New Testament, from the first page to the last, is that it is a record of man s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>It is absolutely human; nothing can be more human than its speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>At the same time, however, it is absolutely divine; it is one hundred percent God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>God is not satisfied with just the expression of His word; He wants His word to be expressed through man s word, so that the word which is released is truly human and at the same time truly divine.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>This is the New Testament ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>In 2 Corinthians 2:4 Paul said, For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>In writing to the Corinthians, Paul was serving them God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>He wrote out of much affliction and anguish of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>He was delivering God s word through many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Here was a man whose entire being was into his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>His whole being constituted his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>His writing was full of his human feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>When God s word came to him, he was filled with affliction and anguish of heart, and he wrote through many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>While he was writing, his human elements were mingled with God s word, and he released God s word this way.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>His human elements enhanced God s word and made it all the more God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Paul was not void of feelings and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>He was not like a tongue-speaker, who receives a word and passes it on without the mind having any effect upon the word itself.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Paul wrote God s word with much feeling and exercise of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>As God s word was uttered, he was in much affliction and anguish of heart, and he wrote through many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>This is a New Testament minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>God s word is expressed through man, the entire man.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>As such, man s characteristics, idiomatic expressions, tone of voice, and subjective experiences before God all flow through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Through the word we can find the extent to which a man has been taught by God, disciplined by God, and tested by God.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>When God s word comes to man, it can be expressed through man s human elements without damaging God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>It does not have to be contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>This is what it means to be a minister of the word in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>A New Testament minister of the word is one who has been taught by God for many years and one whom God can freely use.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>When the word reaches such a man, it can flow through him freely.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>The divine word will suffer contamination only if the human elements which interact with God s word are fleshly or natural.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Only when God s word has been impregnated with the human elements is such a word complete.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Do not be mistaken; God s word is not just one commandment or ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>The Bible shows us clearly that there is a human flavor and human elements within God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>God has put His word into man and entrusted man to speak His word.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Moreover, He requires that man s condition be right so that He can include man in His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>The basic principle of God s speaking is the principle of the Word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>God is not satisfied with having His word alone; He wants His word to become flesh, to become part of man s word.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>This does not mean that God s word has been downgraded to the status of being just man s word.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>It means that God s word has been seasoned with man s flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>However, it is preserved as His pure word.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>It is truly man s word and at the same time truly God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>It is genuinely God s word and at the same time genuinely man s word.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>The New Testament ministry of the word is man speaking God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>In reading the book of Acts as well as 1 and 2 Corinthians, we find men speaking God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>In reading 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, we also find a man speaking God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>God s word is manifested through man s word and expressed through human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>It is man speaking, yet God recognizes it as His word.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>If this is the case, how great is the responsibility of those who speak God s word!</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>If a man makes a mistake or if he introduces unclean elements into his speaking, God s word will be contaminated and will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>We must realize that the critical factor in speaking God s word is not the amount of Bible knowledge one possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>It is useless if all one has are empty doctrines and a knowledge of the Bible.</S>
