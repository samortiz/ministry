   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why was the Lord Jesus delivered?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was because of our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we had had no offenses, the Lord would never have had to be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was because of the offenses that the Lord was delivered to man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, His resurrection was because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Greek the two clauses have the same structure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jesus was delivered because of our offenses and was resurrected because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some Bible translators have misinterpreted Paul's meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They thought that resurrection is for the purpose that man may be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They thought that it is first the resurrection of the Lord, then our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Paul was saying and the Holy Spirit was saying that He was resurrected because we have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To put it simply, it is because we have been justified that the Lord was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some versions say that resurrection comes first, then justification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Holy Spirit says that justification comes first, then resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First there is the matter of our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then there is the death of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same way, first there is our justification, then there is His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was delivered because of our offenses, and He was resurrected because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the resurrection of the Lord Jesus is our proof of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we have been justified, God raised up the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the Lord has satisfied God's righteous requirement, God resurrected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My friends, tonight I have to announce to you some very good news.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although some have believed in the Lord, they are still in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They feel like they are walking on the edge of a precipitous cliff or on thin ice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They think that they have committed their souls, their lives, and their eternal future to the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not know whether this trust in the Lord will be safe or not.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they find out at a later date that this trust does not result in salvation, then they are in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I may believe in the cross of Jesus for the redemption of my sins today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if it fails me on that day, then I am in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today I may say that it is not a matter of doing good or of keeping the law and that all I have to do is rely on the cross of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But what happens if God says in that day that this is not all right?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How do I know today that the cross of the Lord is sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My friends, you should not look at the cross; you should not worry about whether the cross is sensible or not and whether it is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All you need to look at is the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the work of the Lord's cross was not proper or right, God would not have resurrected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, He resurrected because we were justified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we are justified when we trust in the blood of Jesus, the Lord Jesus was resurrected.</S>
