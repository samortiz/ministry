[1]  The Lord Jesus Christ is alone both God and man.
[2]  He is the eternal God, who has become man; and as man, He has been exalted to the highest position in the universe.
[3]  His divine nature energized His human nature and made Him the Son of God, not only in His divinity, in which He had been the Son of God from eternity, but also in His humanity, which now was designated the Son of God through His resurrection Rom 1:4 .
