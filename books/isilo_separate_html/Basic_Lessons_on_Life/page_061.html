Verse 2a speaks of the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus. Verse 6b says that the mind set on the spirit is life. Verse 10 says that if Christ is in us, the body is dead but the spirit is life. Then verse 11 says that the Spirit of the One who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to our mortal body through His Spirit who indwells us. Thus, verse 2 speaks of the divine life, verse 10 says that our spirit is life, verse 6 says our mind can be life, and verse 11 says that even our body may be given life. Verse 8 speaks of God, verse 9 of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, and verse 10 of Christ. We need to read these verses to the saints to show them that the Triune God is dispensed into the three parts of man. While we are reading, it is always profitable to point out the crucial points in every verse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE DIVINE LIFE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Spirit of Life</H2><P>Romans 8:2 speaks of the Spirit of life. "The Spirit of life" is a phrase of apposition, and actually means that the Spirit is life. In the Bible there are a number of phrases like this. When the Bible says "the Spirit of God," that means the Spirit is God; when the Bible says "the life of God," that means the life is God; when the Bible says "the Spirit of Christ," that means the Spirit is Christ; and when the Bible says "the love of God," that means love is God.</P><P>Of course, we know that if there is no Spirit of God, surely there is no life. Life is the Spirit. In Revelation 22:1 there is a picture of the river of the water of life, and that river is the Spirit. This river flows out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. This shows how God in Christ as the Spirit flows Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply. The river is the flow of life; it is life in motion.</P><P>This is like the current of electricity. Actually, the current itself is electricity. It is not something separate from electricity; it is electricity itself in motion. When electricity flows and is in motion, that is the current of electricity. The current of electricity can be compared to the Spirit of life. The Spirit of life means the Spirit is life. The Spirit is life in motion, the Triune God in motion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Christ Jesus</H2><P>This life is of the Spirit and is also in Christ Jesus. Romans 8:2 speaks of the Spirit of life "in Christ Jesus." The phrase "in Christ Jesus" is profound. I believe this phrase will need eternity for us to understand adequately. Today we understand a little. But when we enter into eternity, we will be freed from so many limitations, and then we will realize what it means to be in Christ Jesus.</P><P>In giving such a message, you have to define who Christ is and who Jesus is. The constituents of these two titles are profound. We have a life that is in Christ Jesus. The life is in such a One who is not only God and the Spirit but who is also Christ Jesus. Christ Jesus, this wonderful person, is constituted with many excellent elements. He is the One who has divinity and humanity, who has passed through so many processes, and who has accomplished so much. The life we are enjoying today is a life in such a realm and sphere. This realm and this sphere are an unlimited person, Christ Jesus.</P><P>In Romans 8:2 the Spirit of life is in Christ Jesus, not in Jesus Christ. The life is in Christ and it traces back from Christ to Jesus. We need to let the saints know that "in Christ Jesus" is not an empty term. If it were an empty term, Paul would not use it. Surely this means a lot. We must tell the saints that the very divine life today is not only of the Spirit but is also in such a marvelous, unlimited person as its realm, its sphere.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> </body></html>
