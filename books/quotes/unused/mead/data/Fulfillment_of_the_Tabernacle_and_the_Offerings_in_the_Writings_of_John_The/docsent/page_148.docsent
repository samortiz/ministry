   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Crucified Jesus and the Resurrected Christ with His Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way by which we enter into the Father is the crucified Jesus and the resurrected Christ with His redemption John 14:2b-3; Heb 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once again we would emphasize the fact that the Lord's crucifixion signifies that sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation have all been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All this is signified by the crucified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the way not only includes the crucified Jesus, but also includes the resurrected Christ with His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Access in the Spirit unto the Father</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 2:18 says, "Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse indicates that through Christ as the way we have access in the Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we call, "O Lord Jesus," we have the sense that we are in the presence of God and that God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, this life-giving Spirit is the access for us to touch God and enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A New and Living Way</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Hebrews 10:20, the Lord Jesus as our way into the Father is a new and living way: "By a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 14:6 the Lord also says that He is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apart from the Triune God, the entire universe is vanity, having no content, no reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, the way is God Himself, and this way is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we were to call on a name other than that of the Lord Jesus, we would not have a way into God, because all other names are void of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately on the way into God because the Lord is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, when we call on the name of Jesus, we receive something real into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the reality we receive by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This reality is the being and the doing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, this reality is the incarnated God John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This reality is also the Son John 8:32, 36 and the Spirit John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, the reality is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, this reality includes what the Triune God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the gospel Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reality, therefore, is the very being of the Triune God and what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the universe only what God is and what God does is real.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that the reality in the universe is God's being and God's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's being is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and His doing is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the gospel He is everything and has done everything necessary for us to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive this universal reality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reality is actually the way, and the way is the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we get on the way, we reach the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that when we receive Jesus, we have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we receive the Son as the way, we have the Father as the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the Son is the embodiment of the Father, when we call on the name of the Lord we have both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the reality becoming the way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the Son with what He has done becoming our way to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can we get on this way?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we call on the Lord's name, we are on the way, and we have the Father.</S>
