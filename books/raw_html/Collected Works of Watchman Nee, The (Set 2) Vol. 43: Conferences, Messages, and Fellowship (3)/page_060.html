<h2 class="head1">GOD'S DISCIPLINE FOR OUR PARTAKING<br />OF HIS HOLINESS</h2><p>In order for us to partake of His holiness and glory, and in order for us to learn to express the life of Christ, God chastises us and disciplines us all the time (Heb. 12:7, 10). He loves us and desires that we become useful vessels fit for His use.</p><p>In our eyes, some people are quite useless, yet God has put them among us. What is His purpose for doing this? These ones serve a very important purpose. When they are around, there is the cross. Without them, we have no cross. God is removing our "rawness" through the cross so that we can be mature.</p><p>We should learn submission through our environment and should never be rebellious in our hearts. If we are rebellious, we may not say it with our mouth, but there will be complaints and anger within. Once we rebel and struggle, we will lose the cross that the Lord has measured to us. The Lord puts all these things before us so that we will learn to be mature Christians. In order for a diamond to shine and become a precious treasure, there is the need for little grains of sand to rub against it. God has begotten many Christians who, in our eyes, are good at nothing except reviling and criticizing. Thank God that He is using these little stones to polish us! We are gems, but we are embedded in rocks and cannot shine. God is polishing us with little stones so that we can become a shining and radiant treasure.</p><p>There are some people who are naturally good and patient. But their goodness has never been dealt with by the cross. This goodness is not the result of lessons learned from God. A person may not resist once, twice, or even many times; outwardly he may appear to be very meek. But when he finally loses his temper, no one will be able to control it because his patience was raw; it did not issue from a mature life.</p><p>If a man is born with a very bad temper, yet learns to bear the cross, and through the cross develops patience before the Lord, his patience is far more precious than any natural patience. May the Lord grant us the grace to be those who learn to bear the cross. No matter how hard our circumstances may be and no matter how much burden, shame, and pain we bear, we should accept them gladly if we know that this is God's desire. We should weep before the Lord rather than run away or avoid the cross that the Lord has given us. Once we run away, our pain may go away, but so will the carving work that perfects us into a vessel of the Lord.</p><p>May the Lord carve us, and may we accept His carving and polishing work through the environment He has given us. May we learn to bear the cross and be dealt with by Him. If we do this, God will perform a great miracle in us, and our disposition and character will receive great perfecting through the operation of the cross.</p>
