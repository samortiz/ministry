   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Grace and the Law</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham married Hagar and begot Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians 4 says that "the one of the maidservant was born according to the flesh..from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto slavery, which is Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now this Hagar is Sinai the mountain in Arabia.." vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, Hagar represents the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the law?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law represents God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Ten Commandments represent God's demands on man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God wants this and He wants that.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does it mean to keep the law?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Keeping the law means giving something to God and pleasing God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But Galatians 3:10 says, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the book of the law to do them."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, those who say, "I will please God," are cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why are they cursed?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is because man cannot please God by himself, and he is not qualified to please God Rom 8:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Bible the law is frequently mentioned in conjunction with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 7 is a chapter particularly on the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is also a chapter particularly on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Simply put, the flesh is self-effort; the flesh is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we try to keep the law, we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever man tries to please God by his own effort, the law comes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A person who tries to please God with the fleshly strength is one with whom God is not pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what Hagar and Ishmael represent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hagar represents the law, while Ishmael represents the resulting flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abraham was a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He tried to please God and fulfill God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God wanted him to have a son, and he tried to have a son by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Was this not according to God's will, and did he not do it to please God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Could it be wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, Paul said, "The one of the maidservant was born according to the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is true that God's will should be done.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the question is who should be the one to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we try to do His will by ourselves, the result is Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Abraham was wrong, not in his goal but in his source.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His goal was to see God's promise being fulfilled, but he was wrong to fulfill it by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only will God reject those who do things that are not pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will reject even those who do things that are pleasing to Him, but who do them according to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will not please God if we sin, and neither will we please God if we try to do good by our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether or not we please God depends on whether the cross has done its work in dealing with our flesh and the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are we saying, "God, I cannot do anything, and I am not qualified to do anything; I can only look to You"?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A person who truly believes in God is one who does not act according to his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is the Master of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The thing that offends God the most is usurping His place in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is often where our mistake lies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot believe, we cannot trust, and we cannot wait.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot commit everything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the root of our offense against God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God ordained that Abraham would beget a son through Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Galatians 4:23 tells us that "the one of the free woman was born through promise."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The free woman was Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hagar represents the law, while Sarah represents grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the difference between law and grace?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Doing things by ourselves is law, while grace is God doing things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Simply put, grace is God doing everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are doing it, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only when God is doing it for us is it grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Grace, as defined in the Bible, is not forbearance or tolerance, nor is it doing anything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is something specific that God does in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The specific work God wanted to do in Abraham was begetting Isaac through Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Isaac was to be begotten of Abraham, but he was to be begotten through grace and through God's promise.</S>
