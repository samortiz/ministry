<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Binding and Imprisoning of Satan<br>in the Abyss for One Thousand Years</H2><P>The negative side of the seventh trumpet also includes the binding and imprisoning of Satan in the abyss for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3). Following the defeat of Antichrist, Satan will be bound and imprisoned to clear up the rebellious earth that the kingdom of Christ may come (Rev. 20:4-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Casting of the "Goats,"<br>Those Who Worship Antichrist and Do Not Receive<br>the Eternal Gospel, into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Another item on the negative side of the seventh trumpet is the casting of the "goats," those who worship Antichrist and do not receive the eternal gospel, into the lake of fire (Rev. 14:6-7, 9-11; Matt. 25:31-33, 41-46a). This will occur after the nations are gathered and judged at Christ's throne of glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. The Following Items Also Taking Place<br>during the Three and a Half Years<br>of the Great Tribulation</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. At the Very Beginning<br>of the Three and a Half Years of the<br>Great Tribulation, Satan and His Angels<br>Being Cast to the Earth and<br>Persecuting the "Woman"</H2><P>At the very beginning of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, Satan and his angels will be cast to the earth and will persecute "the woman," consisting of the majority of the believers (those who remain and have the testimony of Jesus and the Jews who keep the commandments of God), until the end of the great tribulation (Rev. 12:9, 12-13, 15-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Remaining Believers,<br>"the Woman," Being Kept and Nourished<br>for a Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty Days</H2><P>The remaining believers, "the woman," will be kept and nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days, that is, the three and a half years of the great tribulation, in a place prepared by God, where they will bear the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 12:6, 14, 17). The overcomers will be raptured, and the majority of the living saints will be left to pass through the great tribulation. But God in His mercy will bring them to a place prepared by Him, the "wilderness," where they will be nourished until the last day of the great tribulation when they will be raptured to Christ's parousia (presence) in the air. I believe that due to their testimony, some will believe in the Lord Jesus. Their testimony will not be totally in vain. The word "nourished" means that they will be fed and taken care of by the Lord and somewhat preserved from the plagues of the great tribulation.</P>
