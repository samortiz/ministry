   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INTRINSIC PROBLEMS AMONG US Not Recognizing God s Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first of the problems today among us is concerning the recognition of God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I never told others not to speak and that I am the only speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I never said that my ministry is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I made it clear repeatedly by my writings that when we say the ministry, we are referring to the New Testament ministry, not just my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If my ministry is a part of that ministry, thank God for this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The problems among us firstly are because we neglect God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not Recognizing the Leadership</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is also the problem among us of not recognizing the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In every age of the work of God through His speaking, there has been a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time of the law, Moses was the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Moses, Joshua became the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, the leadership is not the person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The leadership is God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the people in the age of the law did not actually follow Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Practically speaking, they followed the word of God spoken by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was there with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We always took him as the authority because God s word came to us through him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, it was not he that took the lead but God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word of God is the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>About fifteen years ago, all the churches on this earth respected the leadership of God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But there was a rebellion which put the leadership under a question mark.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ones who took the lead in this recent rebellion not only put a question mark on the leadership; they have also done their best and are still doing their best to overthrow the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I was in mainland China, Brother Nee was the target of all the attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today it is difficult for me to speak, because I am the target.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The leadership among us has been neglected, and some even desire to overthrow it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Trying to Do One s Own Work</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>within the Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The third problem began from Brother Nee s time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A number of saints accept the recovery and come into the recovery, but they try to do their own work in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One co-worker tried to promote, to push, his ministry, but the churches around him would not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The leading ones there said that apparently the churches there were built up by that co-worker, but actually they were built up by the element of Brother Lee s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I called a number of urgent elders trainings because I realized that there was the tendency of division among us due to some who had the desire to do their own work within the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They use the good will, the advantages, of the recovery to do their own work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our Practice of the Lord s Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not Being Strong</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Another problem among us has been that our practice of the Lord s recovery was not that strong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our practice of the church life, we neglected the basic truths of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We care for the condition but not for the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not stress and practice the crucial points of the basic truths in the Lord s recovery, such as the experience of the processed Divine Trinity, the enjoyment of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, the full and adequate application of the consummated, all-inclusive Spirit, the strict attention to the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, the proper practice of the local churches on the proper local ground, etc. This is the fatal weakness in our practice of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should be more than strong and strict in the above-listed items of the basic truths in carrying out the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not Caring for the Discipline</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fifth problem is that we do not care for the discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The discipline is to turn away from the troublemakers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Besides the opposition outside of us, there has been turmoil within.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since certain ones are trying to make divisions among us and trying to cause others to stumble, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should, according to the apostles teaching, turn away from them and not tolerate them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was the reason I was forced to put out The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament there is the type of leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moses and Aaron s sister became leprous and she was quarantined Num 12:9-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moses and Aaron had to reject their natural relationship and affection in order to follow God s speaking to deal with Miriam.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the type of the Old Testament, who is leprous depends upon the decision of the priest, the one who knows the law, the written word, and who also has the present word according to the Urim and Thummim Lev 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For the priest to discern whether or not someone had leprosy was not an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Someone may have leprosy and others cannot discern it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Another one may have what looks like leprosy, when actually it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The proper one who has the written word and the living word has the discernment to judge whether or not someone has leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, I mentioned only four names of ones who should be quarantined.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The churches in California, West Malaysia, and Taiwan also sent out an open letter to quarantine these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this matter we are touching a great truth, the truth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do we honor the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The churches in California, West Malaysia, and Taiwan are parts of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Should we not honor them and respect their feeling?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But some were not clear and strong to keep the truth to maintain the feeling of the Body, which comprises all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must be clear and strong in the truth, and we have to practice the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must practice the truth in Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whatever we do involves the Body, so we have to keep the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The only remedy to the situation is for the faithful ones to come back to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must be the overcomers, the ones who overcome all these situations.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must come back to the truth to practice the recovery in the way of the recovery according to the Lord s word, not according to what we think or how we feel.</S>
