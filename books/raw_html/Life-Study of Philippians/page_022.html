	<h2 class="head1">PAUL&rsquo;S DESIRE TO BE WITH CHRIST</h2><p>Verse 23 says, &ldquo;But I am constrained by the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for it rather is much better.&rdquo; When Paul wrote these words, he was in bonds suffering mistreatment. Under those circumstances, we would expect him to long to be with Christ. Any believer in Paul&rsquo;s situation would have the same desire.</p><p>We have indicated that to be with Christ is a matter of degree, not of place. No doubt, Paul was with Christ in prison. The fact that he was already with Christ indicates that being with Christ is not a matter of place. But although Paul was with Christ to a certain degree, he desired to be with Him in a higher degree. Paul knew that as a result of physical death he would be with Christ to a greater extent than in his earthly life. For this reason, he could desire to depart and to be with Christ, regarding this as much better.</p><h2 class="head1">REMAINING FOR THE SAINTS&rsquo; PROGRESS AND JOY</h2><p>In verse 24 Paul continues, &ldquo;But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.&rdquo; The words <i>your sake</i> mean for the sake of the church. The apostle&rsquo;s consideration was not selfish, but was for the sake of the saints. He was absolutely occupied by the Lord with the church. Paul realized that the churches needed more of the ministry of Christ. For their sake, he would remain in order to minister Christ to them.</p><p>Paul was a person full of Christ. When he spoke, he spoke Christ. When he lived, he lived with Christ. When he worked, he worked with Christ and ministered Christ to the churches. For the sake of the church, he was willing to remain in the flesh that he might minister Christ to the saints.</p><p>Verse 25 says, &ldquo;And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of the faith.&rdquo; The faith here refers to what the saints believe in (Jude 3; 2 Tim. 4:7); progress, to the growth in life; and joy, to the enjoyment of Christ. Paul was willing to remain for the sake of the saints&rsquo; progress and joy of the faith.</p><p>It is possible to be a Christian for years without having any progress or joy, without growing in life and without enjoying the Lord. We need both the growth in life and the enjoyment of Christ. I have known some saints who have been faithful to stay in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But with them there have been little growth in life and little enjoyment of Christ. As a result, they have had little progress and little joy. How about you? What can you say about your progress and your joy? Oh, we need the progress and the enjoyment!</p><p>Whether Paul was in prison or out of prison, he was a strong factor of the saints&rsquo; progress and joy. Because of him the churches could have the growth in life and could be filled with the enjoyment of Christ. This should also be true of us today. All the elders in the local churches should be factors of the saints&rsquo; growth in life and of their enjoyment of Christ. But whether or not the elders are such factors of progress and joy depends on whether or not they magnify Christ by living Him. If the elders live Christ, He will surely be magnified in them. Then the elders will become factors to enable the saints to grow in life and enjoy the Lord.</p>
