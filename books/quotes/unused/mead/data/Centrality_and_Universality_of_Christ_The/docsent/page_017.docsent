   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now I believe we are clear that Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit, who is Christ Himself, is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The best way, and in fact the only proper way, for us to contact such a Christ is to exercise our spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to learn to pray by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I know that whenever we go to the Lord, we go with many problems in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are bothered by the problems, troubles, difficulties, tests, trials, sorrows, pains, and others' unfair dealings with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The most bothering matter is the unfair dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A certain brother has dealt with me in an unfair way that I cannot forget for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is very hard for me to pray with him because his unfair dealing impressed me deeply and affected me to such an extent that I can never forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It bothers me all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why I say that when you go to the Lord you have to cut off the thoughts in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Forget about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Forget about all your troubles, sorrows, pains, testings, trials, etc. Just go to the Lord in the spirit and by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you pray, do not try to remember so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people try to consider too many things when they go to the Lord to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some people asked me, "Brother Lee, if you speak in this way, then what about our prayer list?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you go to the Lord in a living way, you will know what to do with your prayer list.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now we know that we need to contact the Lord by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And in order to exercise our spirit we need to forget about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are occupied with many things, that will only help us to exercise our mind and hinder us from exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From now on, whenever we go to the Lord, let us forget everything in our mind, in our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A husband may ask, "My children are sick, and my wife is not well; should I not remember these things before the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Should I forget about these things?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Or a wife may say, "My husband is out of a job; should I not pray for this?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would tell you that if you could forget about these things, you will be very much blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your wife and your children will be quickly healed, and your husband will get a better job.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are too much concerned in your mentality, in your understanding, and in your realization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are too much occupied by other things, not by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us learn to realize that today Christ as the Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The only way, the proper way, for us to contact Him is to pray to Him by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you pray in this way, eventually you will realize that it is not only you praying by yourself but also Him praying within you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will realize that while you pray, He prays.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He prays with you, and He prays in you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He becomes your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Andrew Murray once said that the best prayer is the Christ within praying to the Christ above.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that the Christ within, that is, the indwelling Christ, prays to the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same meaning is expressed in the last two lines of stanzas 8 and 9 of Hymns, #762 by A. B. Simpson.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Stanza 8 says, "Teach us!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Pray in us, till our prayer shall be/Christ in us praying to the Christ above!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Stanza 9 says, "Teach us!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Pray in us, till our prayer shall be/God in us answering to the God above!"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The real prayer is something in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While you are praying in your spirit, Christ as the Spirit indwelling you prays with you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He prays in your prayer, and you are praying in His prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are mingled with Him.</S>
