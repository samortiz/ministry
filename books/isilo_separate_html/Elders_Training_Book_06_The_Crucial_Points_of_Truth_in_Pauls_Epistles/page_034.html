and the Exercise unto Godliness</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 4:6-8 there are two important matters, the nourishing words and the exercise unto godliness. To minister Christ to others first requires ourselves to be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ. Being nourished is for growth in life, differing merely from being taught, which is a matter of knowledge. Having been nourished with Christ, we shall then have Christ as the food, the life-supply, the nourishing words, to minister to others.</p>
<p>Godliness is Christ lived out of us as the manifestation of God. This very Christ is today the Spirit dwelling in our spirit (Rom. 8:9-10; 2 Tim. 4:22). Hence, to exercise ourselves unto godliness is to exercise our spirit to live Christ in our daily life.</p>
<p>It is of crucial importance that we exercise ourselves unto godliness. Inwardly we need nourishment, and outwardly we should have godliness. From within we should be nourished with Christ, and then we should have a living which is the expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Healthy Words and the Teaching<br />
according to Godliness</h2>
<p>In 6:3 there are two kinds of words: the words of the Lord Jesus which are the healthy words and the teaching according to godliness. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are words of life (John 6:63); hence, healthy words. The healthy words of the Lord are the source of the teaching according to godliness. When the Lord&rsquo;s words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching according to godliness. The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness&mdash;a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ. This is on the positive side.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Desire to Be Rich</h2>
<p>Another crucial point is found in 6:9 and 10: &ldquo;But those who resolve to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all evils, which some having aspired after have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.&rdquo; The resolve mentioned here is related to the strong desire to be rich. This is the love of riches, not the possession of them, that leads the avaricious into temptation. Some are actually rich; some are rich in their desire. This evil desire ruins and destroys them. Ruin here implies destruction, and destruction implies perdition, both temporal and eternal. Those who resolve to be rich fall into a snare, as into a net, and also into many foolish and harmful lustful desires, which cause men to drown or sink into ruin or destruction. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;aspired after&rdquo; in verse 10 means craved for, longed for. Those with this craving have wandered away from the faith; they have been led astray from the contents of our belief, from the faith of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Man of God Laying Hold on the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>In contrast to the man of riches desiring to be rich in 6:9 and 10 is the man of God laying hold on the eternal life in verses 11 and 12: &ldquo;But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness. Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on the eternal life to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.&rdquo; A man of God is one who partakes of God&rsquo;s life and nature (John 1:13; 2 Peter 1:4), thus being one with Him in His life and nature (1 Cor. 6:17) and thereby expressing Him. This corresponds with the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). We should not be men of riches wandering away from the truth that is revealed in the New Testament. Rather we should be men of God laying hold on the eternal life.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 1:1 Paul said he was &ldquo;an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Paul was an apostle established by the Lord according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus. This is the eternal life. Paul was not an apostle according to letters, or ordinances, or ordination, but according to the promise of life. He enjoyed eternal life in his apostolic ministry.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> </body></html>
