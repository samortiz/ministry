   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE WHERE IS HEAVEN?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOREWORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The question covered in this book is a very important one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May the readers not read it with curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This article was written to comfort many pilgrims on the heavenly journey.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It shows them that our hope is sure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the world has many conjectures, the Word of God will not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>HEAVEN IS A PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Heaven is a place and a location.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not a state of being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The concept that heaven is within man's heart, that it is within man's mind, and that it is the pleasant state of man's being is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That is the reasoning of the unbelievers and the curious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They base their concept on their imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The heaven mentioned in the Bible is a place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is in heaven, not within man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The heart of fallen mankind, regardless how good it may be, can never express heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although man may sometimes experience some unspeakable joy, this does not mean that it is heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If heaven is merely this, it is rather confined and too ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The heaven mentioned in the Bible is an actual place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day those of us who believe in the redemption of the Lord Jesus will enter that place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will enter into heaven, rather than heaven entering into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus Christ mentions His "Father's house" in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He went to prepare a place for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When it is ready, He will surely come again to receive them there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This passage can settle the problem of whether or not heaven is an actual place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Lord Jesus ascended into heaven, He ascended with His body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible says, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God" 1 Cor 15:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After our beloved Lord shed His blood for us on the cross, in His resurrection He spoke of His resurrected body, saying, "For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having" Luke 24:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus' body of "flesh and blood" was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet He was not only a spirit, but also a person with "flesh and bones."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He had a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This body was already transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was not like the natural body that was dead 1 Cor 15:42-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was seen by human eyes Luke 24:34 ; He was touchable v. 39 ; He could eat food v. 43 . The Lord Jesus Christ has now ascended into heaven v. 51; Acts 1:9-11 . If heaven is not a place, how can Jesus Christ physically reside there? If we say that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended into heaven with a body, it must mean that heaven is a place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If He has a body, there must also be a place for His body to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These two cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without a place, the body cannot possibly exist.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we think of a tangible object, we think of the place it is associated with.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus ascended into heaven with a body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, heaven must be a place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Note: In the original language, the Bible gives a distinction between heaven and the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The expression the kingdom of heaven should be translated as "the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word heavens is plural in number; it may refer to the heavens above all the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The earth has its heaven, and all the stars have their respective heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It may also refer to the many levels of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul mentions "the third heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word heaven is used in contrast to the earth; it means the place where God's throne is, the place of bliss.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Heaven is a place from which the Lord Jesus descended and in which He still is now.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus descended from heaven to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He redeemed sinners by dying for them on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the Son of God resurrected, He "passed through the heavens" Heb 4:14 , "sat...in the heavens" 8:1 , and He is "become higher than the heavens" 7:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our Savior is not only higher than the things on earth and the things in heaven, He is beyond the realm of all the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Scripture says, "Therefore also God highly exalted Him" Phil 2:9 , "...seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come" Eph 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In studying the Bible, we find out that heaven has at least three levels.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul mentioned that he was once caught away to the third heaven 2 Cor 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps the first level is where the atmosphere is, the second where the stars are, and the third where the throne of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Where is heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some people think that heaven is a certain place in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is round in shape like a ball rotating on its own and revolving around a center.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This center is God's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such a saying is man's idea; it is unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How then can this question be answered?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If God's Word the Bible clearly tells us where heaven is, then it is possible for us to find its whereabouts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if the Bible is silent concerning this matter, we need not waste much thought on it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"The things that are hidden belong to Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed, to us and our children forever..."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Deut 29:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we need not seek to know the secret things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet, we must desire to know the things of God which are revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I believe that many Christians would rejoice to know where heaven is.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thank our Father God that in His Word, He is not silent about this matter.</S>
