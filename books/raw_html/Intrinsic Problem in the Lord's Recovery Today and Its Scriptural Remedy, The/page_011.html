 <h2 class="head2">The Seven Epistles Being Written<br />
as One Book to the Seven Churches</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Each of the Seven Epistles<br />
Being Addressed by the Lord to a Particular Church in a Certain Locality</h2>
<p>The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 were written as one book to the seven churches (Rev. 1:4a). Before the book of Revelation, every epistle was written and sent particularly to a certain church. However, in Revelation, the Lord wrote seven epistles and put them together in one book. These epistles were addressed by the Lord to the seven particular churches separately (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14), but they were sent not as seven books but as one book.</p>
<h2 class="head3">All the Seven Epistles Being<br />
Closed as the Speaking of the Spirit<br />
to All the Churches</h2>
<p>Although the contents of the seven epistles differ, at the end of each epistle there is the same closing word: &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&rdquo; (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Each epistle was written to a particular church in a certain locality, yet all the seven epistles were closed in the same way, as the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking to all the churches. This means that each epistle was written to all the churches, and it indicates that all the churches should be the same. This is the second item as the base for all the churches to practice the one accord. There must be the one accord among all the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Apostle Teaching the Same Thing<br />
in All the Churches</h2>
<h2 class="head3">An Epistle Written to a Certain Church<br />
Being Also for Other Churches</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul taught the same thing in all the churches (1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17). This means that all the churches in all the different localities should be the same. In Colossians 4:16 Paul wrote, &ldquo;And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea.&rdquo; The epistle to the church in Colosse was also for the church in Laodicea, and the epistle to the church in Laodicea was also for the church in Colosse. Thus, every epistle was written not only for the receiving church but also for all the other churches. This indicates that the Lord wants all the churches to have the one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Teaching Differently Being Prohibited</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul said that he urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. To teach differently is to teach things different from what the apostles teach, that is, to teach things other than God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (1 Tim. 1:4). This indicates that all the teaching ones should teach the same things in all the churches according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Of course, this indicates also that all the churches should be one in the matter of teaching. This does not mean that in the matter of teaching all the churches should give the same messages and use the same books, even at the same time; it means that all the churches should not teach things that are different from the New Testament revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Examples of such teaching are the teaching of the Mosaic law (1 Tim. 1:7) and the teaching of Jewish genealogies (1 Tim. 1:4) by some Christian teachers at Paul&rsquo;s time, which were different from ministering Christ to people according to the proper revelation as taught in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All the Churches Being the Same<br />
in Their Custom and Practice</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Same in Custom</h2>
<p>All the churches were the same in their customs (1 Cor. 11:16). In 1 Corinthians 11:16, after instructing the saints concerning the matter of head covering, Paul said, &ldquo;But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.&rdquo; This indicates that all the churches were the same in their customs. A custom among the churches should not be considered a business affair. Paul told those who would express their opinions in order to dispute with him concerning head covering that the churches did not have the custom of disputation concerning the apostles&rsquo; teaching. This is not a matter of business; it is a matter of the customs among the churches.</p>
