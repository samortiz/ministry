[2]  Volume 46 of The Collected Works includes miscellaneous messages given by Watchman Nee throughout the period of time covered in Set 2 of The Collected Works.
[3]  They are primarily notes on messages and fellowship from Sister Elizabeth Rademacher's collection.
[4]  MISCELLANEOUS MESSAGES AND FELLOWSHIP CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY GOD'S CHRIST
[5]  AND THE THINGS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 1:15-19; 2:6; Rom 8:32; John 6:35; 8:12; 11:25; 14:6; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:10
[6]  AND PROPHETS Scripture Reading: Luke 24:25-27; Heb 11:24-26; John 12:41; 8:56; Acts 2:25-28, 30-31; 1 Cor 7:25b, 40b
[7]  When our Lord was on the earth, He plainly stated that He could be found in the Old Testament: in the books of Moses, in the psalms of David, and in the prophetic writings.
[8]  We readily admit that, in addition to the law, psalms, and prophecies in the Old Testament, there is also Christ.
[9]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO SPIRITUAL REALITY THREE VIEWS
[10]  Editor's Note: This article is similar to the first part of "The Holy Spirit and Reality" in Volume 36 of The Collected Works.
[11]  We have included this chapter in this volume because it contains some additional utterance.
[12]  The Word does not say that a person's immersion symbolizes his receiving life, but that he actually does receive life.
[13]  Note the bold declarations that Paul makes about baptism: "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
[14]  We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life" Rom 6:3-4 .
[15]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-THREE THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[16]  What is the fundamental difference between the work of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament and the work of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament?
[17]  "And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing" 2 Cor 4:3 .
[18]  God made man a type of doctrine, and woman a type of experience.
[19]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX ANOINTING IN RELATION TO MINISTRY Scripture Reading: Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38; 1 John 2:27; Lev 14:14-17; 8:22-30; Psa 133
[20]  Aaron did not exercise his priestly ministry until after his anointing, and David did not enter into his kingly ministry until he had been anointed.
[21]  Let us specially note Acts 2:33, which says, "He has poured out this."
[22]  The Holy Spirit was poured out by the Lord Jesus at Pentecost.
[23]  He was poured out on the basis that Jesus was exalted!
[24]  The Spirit was not poured out because I have a clean heart or have been earnestly seeking and praying, but only because the Lord had been exalted.
[25]  Israel must be brought to know assuredly that God has made this same Jesus both Lord and Christ.
[26]  Two New Testament books deal specifically with the subject of the law: Romans and Galatians.
[27]  In reading the Epistles it is necessary to differentiate between "law" and "the law."
[28]  Where the definite article is used, the word refers to the Mosaic law; when there is no article, the word refers to law as a principle.
[29]  Editor's Note: The following message was given by Watchman Nee in Denmark in 1938.
[30]  Part of this message is incorporated in chapter nine of The Normal Christian Life.
[31]  We have seen that in delivering us from sin God did not deal with sin directly, neither did He touch the body of sin; rather, He crucified our old man.
[32]  This picture is not drawn by me, but by Paul.
[33]  The first husband is the law, the second husband is Christ, and we are the woman.
[34]  The law requires much but offers no help in carrying out its requirements.
[35]  The Lord requires just as much and even more Matt 5:21-39 , but He carries out what He requires of us.
[36]  The law makes demands and leaves us helpless to fulfill them; Christ makes demands, but He fulfills the very demands He makes.
[37]  God is waiting for the prayers of His children to bring His kingdom in. The Lord taught us to pray, "Your kingdom come." This age is important, but the kingdom age is more important.
[38]  All the privileges and power we now enjoy are only a foretaste and pledge of the age to come.
[39]  The fullness of God is manifested in the kingdom age.
[40]  God has com- manded His people to pray for thousands of years, but He has given no instructions throughout the centuries concerning what we should pray about other than this one prayer.
[41]  There are many points in the history of Israel which are similar to the history of the church.
[42]  The first thing we should recognize is that God is a God of purpose.
[43]  In Matthew 10:29 the Lord said, "Not one of them sparrows will fall to the earth apart from your Father."
[44]  Even the death of a sparrow, which seems too trifling to note, is something that God takes account of.
[45]  In God's thought man was not only to be the instrument of the eternal purpose, but was also the vessel for His eternal purpose.
[46]  The eternal purpose was to be secured through man, but it was also to be secured for man.
[47]  Man was to undo the enemy's work, and he was also to reap the benefit of that undoing.
[48]  This is like sending a person for something, and then telling him that the thing for which he was sent also belongs to him.
[49]  Nothing was said of Adam's blood, because there was no propitiation in view, and there was no need of propitiation because there was no sin then to deal with.
[50]  Before we actually go into the Word of God regarding the Body of Christ, it will be well to look back at Romans 1 8 in order to lead us into chapter twelve.
[51]  Chapters nine through eleven are parenthetical, so we can put them in brackets and let chapter twelve follow chapter eight.
[52]  The foundation of God's building is always the same.
[53]  The building differs in its material and workmanship, but there would be no building without Christ as the foundation.
[54]  God does not and will not ask how large a building we have built or how clever, speedy, or ornate it is, but of what material has it been built with.
[55]  God never allows the church to take over the individual's responsibility of receiving guidance from God.
[56]  Agabus was a prophet and a very earnest one, but he was young, inexperienced, and very anxious to display his guidance for Paul.
[57]  On the one hand, we find in God's Word that one needs clear guidance from God.
[58]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SEVEN PRIESTLY MINISTRY Scripture Reading: Exo 19:1-6; 1 Pet 2:5-9; Rev 1:6; 22:3-4; Phil 4:18; Rom 12:1; Heb 2:10; 4:16; 5:1; 6:19; 7:18-25; 8:1, 3; 9:7-8, 24; 10:19-22; 12:22; 13:14-15; Acts 13:1-2
[59]  In the book of Genesis we see God's creation of man for the realization of His purpose and man's failure regarding that purpose.
[60]  Then we see God moving to recover what was lost in man.
[61]  According to Nehemiah 8:10, the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[62]  It is not a matter of having strength because we have peace.
[63]  Would you like to have the faith of George M ller?
[64]  Do you think that this would be a great thing?
[65]  In Mark 11:14 the Lord said to the fig-tree, "May no one eat fruit from you forever!"
[66]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FAITH Scripture Reading: Mark 11:24
[67]  It is one of the biggest verses in the Bible.
[68]  John 3:16 speaks of "every one," but this verse speaks of "all things."
[69]  John 3:16 tells us that "every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life"; Mark 11:24 tells us that "all things that you pray and ask...you will have them."
[70]  In the past I have been asked quite often to pray for the sick.
[71]  Immediately after the prayer, I knew whether or not the person was going to be healed.
[72]  After entering the room I would anoint him, depending upon the situation, and after my prayer I would ask, "Well, how is your sickness?"
[73]  If he said that there is no need because it was all done, I could leave in confidence, no matter how serious his condition seemed to be, because he did not believe that God would heal him, but that He had already healed him.
[74]  Regarding salvation we must believe that it is already done.
[75]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-ONE THE CUP Scripture Reading: Mark 10:37-40
[76]  We have to drink the cup that the Lord drinks.
[77]  We are put into the same position and we should have fellowship with Him along this line.
[78]  The cup and baptism that is referred to in this verse have nothing to do with atonement, which is something we have no part in.
[79]  This cup is doing the will of God, and it is doing His will irregardless of the things that are involved.
[80]  Certain things are bound up with the will of God, but we should not be occupied with these things as such, but with God's will itself.
[81]  WOODEN AND EARTHEN VESSELS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:12-13; 2 Tim 2:19-22
[82]  I do not believe that the church is in ruins.
[83]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-THREE THE LIMITATIONS OF GOD Scripture Reading: 2 Chron 16:9; 2 Kings 13:18-19; Matt 13:22; 23:37-38; Mark 1:45; 6:5; John 5:19, 30; Luke 12:49-50; Num 14:22-24; Isa 50:2; Mal 3:10-12; Eph 1:22-23
[84]  The Lord has been speaking to us these days on the limitations of God.
[85]  We talk a great deal about the power of God, but we seldom think of the limitations of God.
[86]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FOUR THE OFFENSE OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Matt 11:6
[87]  The sphere of our work determines the sphere in which we find our fellow workers.
[88]  Before we settle the question of fellow workers we must settle this question: What is our work?
[89]  There is no possibility of solving the problem of our co-workers until the problem of our own work is solved.
[90]  All of the work that He does has a definite measure and a definite sphere which is not limited by man.
[91]  We may confess that there are many things we cannot do; we may confess that we are too weak to do God's will, to fulfill His holiness, to work for Him, or to please Him.
[92]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-SEVEN THE TWO WILLS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Matt 17:24-27
[93]  "Take that and give it to them for Me and you."
[94]  It might seem as if the Lord was wrong when He instructed Peter to pay the temple tax, because according to verse 26 "the sons are free."
[95]  God does not make any demand on His sons; therefore, it is not His mind or will for sons to pay.
[96]  When our Lord was in Gethsemane, He prayed, "Not My will, but Yours" Luke 22:42 .
[97]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE THE SUPPRESSION OF AFFECTIONS Scripture Reading: Col 2:16-23, verse 18 refers to doing one's own will in humility; 2 Tim 3:1-5; 1 Tim 4.
[98]  Knowledge of these passages will equip us to help others.
[99]  In the Scripture three words are used for life: zoe spirit , psuche soul, strength of nature , and bios physical life .
[100]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY THE PRESENT WILL OF GOD Scripture Reading: Num 14:29-30, 40, 44-45; 20:10-12
[101]  The passages concerning Moses striking the rock a second time are quite serious.
[102]  They speak of a Potter and a marred vessel; they also speak of God changing His mind.
[103]  We cannot live in Philippians 3 unless we first know Romans 6 in our vital experience.
[104]  Philippians 3 speaks of the death of the new man, and of taking the resurrection life back to the cross and having the stamp of death placed upon it.
[105]  After His baptism Christ was on resurrection ground, yet He was constantly under the shadow of the cross: "Not My will, but Yours" Luke 22:42 .
[106]  The imparting of life was not an afterthought on the part of God.
[107]  God did not desire to impart the divine life to man only after the fall.
[108]  As the last Adam, the representative of the whole Adamic creation, He gathered every son of Adam into Himself, and in His death He brought the whole race to an end as far as God was concerned.
[109]  John 12 and Luke 12 make it clear that there is an aspect of death which is only for the release of life.
[110]  One alone had God's life, and He had to die in order to release His life.
[111]  There was life in the grain of wheat, but it had to die in order to produce many grains.
[112]  The death of the first grain is not to propitiate for the other grains but to produce them.
[113]  The fourth aspect of Christ's death is allowing the cross to be the ruling principle of our life, daily allowing it to undercut our natural life and power Matt 10:34-39; Mark 8:32-35; Luke 17:32-34; John 12:24-26; 2 Cor 4:10-11; Phil 3:10 .
[114]  In this way the natural life and power will not act according to itself or assert itself.
[115]  In order to touch the very core of our problem, we must deal with the question of the soul.
[116]  In this way the dying or killing of the Lord Jesus will release and manifest His life in us.
[117]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-THREE FOUR KINDS OF DISCIPLINE Scripture Reading: Matt 18:15-20; Titus 1:13; 2:15; 1 Cor 5:2-8; 2 Tim 3:1-5, 16; John 15:1-2; Rom 16:17; Gal 6:1; Heb 3:6; 2 Thes 3:6
[118]  Second Timothy 3:16 says, "All Scripture is God-breathed."
[119]  The object of Scripture is fourfold: "for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."
[120]  In reading these words we cannot help but notice that the purposes for which the Scripture has been given are chiefly negative.
[121]  There is a discipline which might be termed parental discipline, in contrast to the brotherly discipline of which we have just spoken.
[122]  In the latter case the one corrected and the one who corrects stand on equal footing; in the former case the one who corrects is in a place of spiritual seniority.
[123]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR FIVE KINDS OF FORGIVENESS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:32; 1 John 1:9; John 20:23; James 5:15-16; Matt 6:14-15; Gal 6:7; Luke 6:37-38; 2 Sam 12:9, 14
[124]  According to John 20:23, the disciples have the authority to forgive: "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven."
[125]  According to 1 John 1:9, if we confess our sins, He will forgive us.
[126]  In Matthew 6:14-15 the Lord said, "If you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also; but if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses."
[127]  In Matthew 18:23-35 the Lord speaks of a man who was forgiven.
[128]  He delivered him to the torturers until he had paid all that was owed, and Jesus said, "So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts" v. 35 . This matter is certainly not of salvation, because eternal salvation is based on the Lord Jesus, not on human effort! We are saved by grace and not by works.
[129]  In verses 20 and 21 the Pharisees asked a question "as to when the kingdom of God was coming."
[130]  The Lord answered, "The kingdom of God is in the midst of you."
[131]  God does not sanction any division of His church except on the ground of locality.
[132]  Therefore, in this place there must be only one church.
[133]  Because He died, He is Lord of the dead, and because He lives, He is Lord of the living.
[134]  We are neither lord of the dead nor of the living, so we dare not take it upon ourselves to regulate people's outward actions according to what we believe is right or wrong.
[135]  Our only responsibility is to seek to bring them into a more intimate relationship with the Lord.
[136]  In verse 10 two things are forbidden among the children of God judging and despising.
[137]  "I will be like the dew to Israel;/He will bud like the lily /And will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon./His shoots will go forth;/And his splendor will be like that of the olive tree,/And his fragrance, like that of the trees of Lebanon./Those who sit under his shade will return;/They will revive like grain/And will bud like the vine;/His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon."
[138]  Verse 5 refers to life, verse 6 refers to work, and verse 7 refers to fruit.
[139]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-EIGHT THE BOOK OF THE REVELATION Scripture Reading: Gen 3:14-15; John 16:13-14; Rev 1:1 3:22
[140]  This book of "the revelation" concerns the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[141]  This book not only makes known future events, it also makes known the person of Jesus Christ.
[142]  Many people read Revelation for the sake of prophecy, but while there is prophecy in it, it is not a book of prophecy.
[143]  This book is specifically designated to be "the revelation of Jesus Christ," because its object is to make known who Christ is.
[144]  It does not reveal how Christ saves or how Christ empowers; it reveals how the Lamb of God in the purpose of God is related to the throne of God.
[145]  We think that if we know Jesus Christ as our Savior, then we have had a revelation of Him, and that if we know Him as our power, then we have had a revelation of Him.
[146]  "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus."
[147]  It is significant that John calls himself a partaker in the endurance of Jesus at the beginning of a book which specifically deals with judgment.
[148]  The book of Revelation brings us to a point where God sets endurance aside and executes judgment.
[149]  CHAPTER TWO HUNDRED WORSHIP Notes from a conference given in Shanghai in 1940 ONE Scripture Reading: Exo 20:3-11; 32:8; 34:14; Deut 4:15-19; 8:19; 11:16-17; 17:2-5; 29:26-27; 30:17, 19; 1 Kings 9:6-7, 9; 2 Chron 29:28-30; Neh 9:3-6; Matt 2:2, 11; 4:9-10; Rev 4:10-11; 5:14; 7:11-12; 9:20-21; 11:1, 16-17; 13:4, 8, 12, 15; 14:7, 9, 11; 16:2; 19:4, 6; 20:4; 22:8-9 The Importance of Worship
[150]  Many people give more importance to the Lord as the Savior than to Him as the Creator.
[151]  It is true that we must first recognize Him as our Savior before we can know the Lord as God.
[152]  But it is not enough to know Him only as the Savior; it is not enough to know only His redeeming work.
[153]  TWO Scripture Reading: Psa 5:7; 29:2; 66:4; 86:9-10; 132:7; 138:2; Isa 66:23; Zech 14:16-17; Deut 26:10; Rom 1:25; Isa 27:13; 2 Sam 12:20; 2 Chron 32:12; Gen 24:26, 52; Exo 4:30-31; 12:27; 24:1; 34:5-8; Josh 5:13-14; Judg.
[154]  The object of creation is that God may receive worship, while the object of Satan's work is to receive worship as well.
[155]  THREE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:27; 2:7; 3:5; 46:27; Matt 2:3; 5; 10:38-39; John 4:19-24; 1 Cor 2:14; 1:26-28; 6:17
[156]  In order to understand worship we must understand John 4.
[157]  The special question in view is worship in relationship to man's creation and man's salvation.
[158]  God is Spirit; therefore, we must use our spirit to worship Him.
[159]  FOUR Scripture Reading: John 4; Gen 22; Isa 27:1; 2 Sam 12:20; Psa 132:7; Zech 14:16-17; 2 Chron 32:12
[160]  John 4:23 says that "the Father...seeks such to worship Him."
[161]  FIVE Scripture Reading: Gen 24:12-14; Exo 4:31; 12:27; 34:8-9; Josh 5:13-14; Judg.
[162]  7:13-15; 1 Sam 1:27-28; 2 Sam 12:20; Job 1:20-22; Matt 2:9-11
[163]  We can trace a line right through Revelation and see what the devil is fighting for.
[164]  In the first chapter of Revelation we see Christ as the Lord of war, not as the Head of the church or as the Savior.
[165]  Many prayers are not answered because our faith is too big!
[166]  God requires faith only as large as a mustard seed and no larger.
[167]  We may feel that we have little or no faith.
[168]  We may be before Him with no confidence in our own faith, in fear and trembling, and with no assurance whatever, but this does not matter, because God answers according to what He is.
[169]  True faith will always be like a mustard seed, deep within our spirits, springing out of brokenness and weakness, but knowing that God is God and that He has His perfect plans and ways and that He will accomplish His work no matter what we are.
