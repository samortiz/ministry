   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE SOME BASIC ITEMS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN SOME BASIC ITEMS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John occupies a special place in God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a book much loved by Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I myself have been studying it since 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message I would like us to consider some of the key verses, in order that we might realize the particular characteristic of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Notice the simple words with which it opens: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even a young child can read these words, yet who can understand them?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What was the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does it say that the Word, rather than God, was in the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John opens with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then at the end of the book, there is the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit" 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Between the opening verse on the Word and the final item of the breath, many matters are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is here, for "the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life is also here, for "In Him was life" 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Flesh is here, for "the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us" v. 14 . Flesh here means man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, as Genesis 6:3 indicates, flesh means fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are two great events which transpired in the history of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first was creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before creation, there was nothing but God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the time came, God brought all things into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But God was apart from all the things which He created.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was not in the sun or moon, nor was He in the trees or animals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He created them, but He was outside of them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the second great event, however, the story is different.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the incarnation, when God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The incarnation was not to bring the universe into existence out of nothing; rather, it was to bring God into the existing man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There was a man by the name of Jesus with whom was God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From the time this One lived on earth, God was no longer outside His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He had entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jesus is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>FULLNESS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another matter covered in John is fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace" 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fullness means everything that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It includes all the divine attributes, all the human virtues, and all the supplies for life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is rich and full.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Out of this fullness we all received.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Have you received something of God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is one thing to learn something of God, but another to receive something of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How much have you received?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your receiving has not ended yet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Day by day you continue to receive out of His fullness.</S>
