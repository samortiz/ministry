   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. The Life to His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is the life to His believers for them to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Colossians 3:4 speaks of "Christ our life."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The life which is God, the life that God is, is in Christ John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus Himself said that He is life John 11:25 and that He came that we may have life John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, he who has Christ has life 1 John 5:12 , and Christ now dwells in the believers as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only is the all-inclusive Christ our portion that we may enjoy Him; He is also life that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>G. The Head of His Body</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to know Christ as the Head of His Body to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Colossians 1:18 says, "He is the Head of the Body, the church."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ needs an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, He expresses God; on the other hand, He is expressed by the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Head expresses God, and the Body expresses the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Christ is the Head of the Body, we need to hold the Head so that the Body may grow with the growth of God 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the Body to hold the Head means that the Body does not allow itself to be separated from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we truly hold Christ as the Head of the Body, we will not be separated from Him by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TO KNOW THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Next, we need to know the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A. The Transfiguration of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The consummated Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the embodiment of God, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In resurrection Christ, the last Adam in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ's resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was the Christ in the flesh, but through resurrection He was transfigured into the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. The Compound Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The compound Spirit is the Spirit compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power typified by the elements of the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the type in Exodus 30, the anointing ointment was a compound of one main item a hin of olive oil compounded with four spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In typology, oil signifies the Spirit of God; flowing myrrh, Christ's death; cinnamon, the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death; calamus, Christ's resurrection; and cassia, the power, especially the repelling power, of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The type of the anointing ointment has been fulfilled completely in the life-giving Spirit, containing Christ's divinity, humanity, the sweetness and effectiveness of His death, and the power and effectiveness of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The life-giving Spirit, therefore, is the compound Spirit.</S>
