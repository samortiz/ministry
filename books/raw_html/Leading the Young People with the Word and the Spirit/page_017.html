<h1 class="title">TEACHING SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE&mdash;<br />
THE INCARNATION OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: April 7, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING THE YOUNG PEOPLE&rsquo;S SPIRIT<br />
BEING ESSENTIAL IN OUR LEADING</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship briefly concerning how to lead the young people. When we lead the young people in matters related to life, we should charge them to practice the points that we cover. In the following meeting we should review the point that was covered and fellowship about their practice. Then we can introduce another point. When we are leading the young people&rsquo;s meeting, our spirit must be strong since it is possible to fall into a doctrinal discussion because of the substantial educational element associated with teaching spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>Young people like to use their mind. Even as children they use their mind and engage in reasoning. Consequently, our teaching can hinder them spiritually if our spirit is not strong, uplifted, and released in the meeting. When we open our mouth to speak or pray, our spirit should be released. When our spirit is released, it is easy for their spirit to be stirred up. Such an atmosphere will affect them strongly. Without the release of the spirit, the young people&rsquo;s meeting will fall into the realm of knowledge. If we give the young people a small amount of Bible knowledge in every meeting but do not touch their spirit, we will be giving them only educational points. Even though these points are different in content from the general education in the world, they will have no reality without the release of the spirit.</p>
<p>According to my observation, we fail to touch the spirit of the young ones in the young people&rsquo;s meetings. Some of them come to the young people&rsquo;s meeting or the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting simply because their parents are Christians. However, they do not receive much supply in their spirit. At the most they receive a little knowledge. This is because those who are leading the meeting are neither fresh nor strong in their spirit. While it is true that we should give them something that is educational in nature, it is even more important that we touch their spirit. Our leading should have a component of both education and spiritual exercise. On one hand, they should receive something educational to instruct their mind and focus their intellect. On the other hand, our leading should touch their spirit in a fresh and living way. At the same time, they should be encouraged to exercise their spirit to pray so that the Spirit can touch them in their spirit. As the young ones learn to pray, they will also experience being enlivened in their spirit. When they begin to pray, an atmosphere of prayer will be manifested, and gradually, their prayer will come out of the spirit. Then they will receive a genuine supply in the meeting. In this way the knowledge that they receive will be matched by the supply in the spirit.</p>
<p>Being supplied in spirit cannot be separated from receiving knowledge, because every person has a mind as well as a spirit. Our leading of the young people should involve instruction for their mind. However, if our instruction has no element of the release of the spirit, our leading will be ineffective. When we speak to the young people, our word must be educational in nature, having an intellectual component, but at the same time, our spirit must be strong and full. In this way our words will convey an element of the spirit. We must release our spirit when we speak, when we pray, and when we sing in order to touch the spirit of the young people. Our instruction of knowledge and our stirring up of the spirit must occur simultaneously. Knowledge enlightens the mind, whereas the release of the spirit touches the spirit. When our intellect is enlightened and our spirit is open, our fellowship with the Lord will result in receiving a genuine supply.</p>
<p>It is not easy to lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting. Some think that it is easier to lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting than it is to lead a regular meeting. This is a wrong concept. From a certain standpoint, it is easy for the young ones to be stirred up to pursue the Lord; but from another standpoint, it is not easy for young people to genuinely touch their spirit. The young people are easily excited, and they can easily be touched in their intellect. However, leading them to touch their spirit is often much more difficult than leading the older saints. In order to lead the young people, we must be strong in our spirit.</p>
<p>In the young people&rsquo;s meeting, we should pay attention as to whether or not the number of those who are attending is increasing. Furthermore, we must also pay attention to whether or not the young people are comprehending and receiving the teaching that is being given. Even more important, however, we need to see a response in their spirit. Every young person must have a strong response in his spirit at least once in order to have a genuine change before the Lord. We also must contact the young people individually and apart from the young people&rsquo;s meeting. If we do not have time to contact every one of them, we should seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading and make contact with them individually according to the need. During our contact, we should exercise our spirit so that we touch their spirit and cause their spirit to be enlivened.</p>
<p>In the young people&rsquo;s meeting, the most crucial matter involves the spirit of the young ones being enlivened. Therefore, the speaking related to the material that has been prepared should be limited. If we speak too much, they will receive it only with their mind. If we continue in this way for six months, the majority of what they receive from the meetings will be related to the material rather than to the moving and activity in their spirit. Such a result goes against the nature of a Christian meeting, which should be focused on supplying people with the spirit. Nevertheless, in order to supply others with the spirit, we also need to enlighten their mind. In the world the purpose of education is solely directed toward developing the human intellect; there is no consideration of the spirit. However, when we speak a message, we should impart a spiritual education for the purpose of touching their spirit. If we only instruct the mind without reaching the spirit, we have utterly fallen short of our goal, and our work will be in vain. Consequently, those who are involved with the young people&rsquo;s meeting should be very clear that the goal of using the materials to instruct the young saints is to touch their spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
