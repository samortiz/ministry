   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Place 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Stand before the Son of Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The place to which the overcomers will be raptured is before the Son of Man in the heavens Luke 21:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the time of the rapture of the overcomers, Christ will not yet have left heaven and have come down to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Much less, will He have come down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The overcomers who have overcome the snare of the Devil will stand before the Son of Man in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To Be Caught up to the Throne of God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As 12:5 indicates, the man-child will be caught up to the throne of God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Probably most Christians know that 1 Thessalonians 4 says that those who are alive and remain will be caught up to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But here we see that the man-child will be caught up to the throne of God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To Stand on Mount Zion</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that the firstfruit will stand on Mount Zion in the heavens also proves that the place to which the overcomers will be raptured is the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these verses indicate that the overcomers will not be raptured to the air but to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, with respect to both time and place, the rapture of the overcomers is absolutely different from the rapture of the majority of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>F. The Conditions 1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Watch and Pray Always</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we come to the conditions of the rapture of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By conditions we mean the terms and price we must pay for this early rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Firstly, we must watch and pray always Luke 21:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To watch and pray always does not mean that we only pray and do not work, sleep, or eat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means that while we are working, we have a praying spirit and are constantly praying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To have this constant prayer does not require that we cease working.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you cannot pray while you are working, then your prayer must not be very genuine; rather, it must be a formal, religious performance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The best prayer is that while you are busy working, you constantly and simultaneously look unto the Lord with a living spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is real and genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all can pray constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even when I speak, I am praying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While you are fellowshipping with others, you should be praying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to be a praying people with a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to pray all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what it means to pray always.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Watch and Be Ready</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A second condition is that we must watch and be ready Matt 24:40-44; Luke 12:35-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be able to say, Lord, I m busy working, but I m ready to go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, here I am cleaning my things and keeping them in order, but I don t want to live here forever.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, I m ready to be taken.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Can you tell the Lord this?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be ready does not mean that we stop working and do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the last century, some people did this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A certain teacher told them that at a particular time Christ would come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After hearing this, they bathed thoroughly, put on white garments, and did nothing except pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not the proper way to wait for the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The proper way is to live a normal life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible nowhere tells us to take a shower, put on white clothing, and wait for the Lord to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, the Lord Jesus says that no one will know the time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As two brothers will be working in the field, much to their surprise, one will suddenly be taken away and the other will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must not understand the Bible according to our human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many Christians who care for the Lord s coming back hold the concept that since the Lord is coming soon, it is better for them to do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No, everything depends upon a normal living and upon contacting the Lord all the time with a living spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Tell the Lord, Lord, I have no ties on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I m ready to go anytime You want to take me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the way to watch and to be ready.</S>
