<h1 class="title">CONCERNING VISITING PEOPLE<br />
FOR GOSPEL PREACHING<br />
AND HOME MEETINGS FOR RAISING<br />
THE NEW BELIEVERS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we would like to fellowship concerning visiting people for gospel preaching and having home meetings for raising the new believers. We have been studying these matters for over three and a half years. We have learned much and have picked up many good points related to these practices.</p>
<p>We practiced visiting people for gospel preaching for nearly one and a half years in Taipei. Within the three terms of our training there, about twenty-six thousand people were baptized, mostly through the trainees. Through our practice there, we have learned much and have discovered many secrets. What we have learned will help you to save your time and to be saved from many troubles.</p>
<p>In Taipei we first endeavored to determine whether visiting people by door-knocking would really be workable. We found out that visiting people for the preaching of the gospel really works. We also found out that door-knocking can be done quickly but that we do not need to go too fast. We were too quick in our door-knocking. In a good sense, we realized that we should not have had that many baptisms. Eventually, thirty-eight thousand people have been baptized in Taipei, but our manpower can only take care of about six thousand. To take care of six thousand people as newborn babes needs manpower. Without the manpower, it cannot be done. About thirty thousand baptized ones have been left without much care. This became a burden to the feeling of the serving ones and to the entire church. Those thirty thousand confessed the name of the Lord, they called on this holy name, and they were baptized, but there has not been the adequate care for them. This was not pleasing and encouraging to us. Therefore, we have made a strong decision that from this term of the training we will instruct the trainees and the local saints that knocking on doors to get people saved and baptized and setting up home meetings to take care of them should be done in a proper proportion. We will proportion our time for these two things. We should not spend ninety-five percent of our time on door-knocking and baptisms and only five percent of our time and manpower to take care of the new ones. This is not wise. From now on we should not go too fast, caring only for the number of baptisms.</p>
<p>What we are fellowshipping here is a result of our study. This is not a law or a constitution for the Lord&rsquo;s new move. We do not have anything constitutional, but we have a living spirit within us. Whatever we practice should be very flexible. In the past three and a half years, we have shifted our practice one way and then the other. We have shifted our way in the training more than five or six times. We have to do it this way. Students of science must change their way in the laboratory many times in order to discover principles and rules. Through our practice we have learned something. But after one week our practice may change again. The coach of a basketball team will change his ways quite often. He will be very flexible, not caring for his instruction but for getting the ball into the basket. He only cares for how many goals his team gets.</p>
<p>What we are doing now, we have never done before. We did much preaching forty years ago, but we never practiced the present way. The present way was quite new to me, and it is still new to me because we have not picked up the adequate experiences. Only experience will teach us things in a practical way. To talk is one thing, but to practice is another. Your talking with many opinions is not needed if you have not lifted your finger for this work. We must put not only our finger but also our entire being into this. This is what we did in Taipei.</p>
<p>Before we began to practice the new way, we had no assurance that we could gain people through preaching the gospel by visiting them in their homes. We did not know how many we would get. The year after I left mainland China, I went to the Philippines and began to charge the saints in the local churches to bring at least one sinner to the Lord each year. All the attendants in the meetings felt that this would be easy. Everyone said that they could gain one person in three hundred and sixty-five days. Every year for eleven years I stayed in the Philippines for three or four months. In not one of those years did they make their goal. It was altogether a failure. Among the hundreds of saints who did love the Lord, not more than ten made the goal. Afterwards, they had no assurance or confidence that this could be worked out.</p>
<p>However, since we have picked up the new way and practiced it, we have the scientific assurance. I can assure you that as long as you knock on doors to preach the gospel in a proper way, you will gain one person for every twenty doors that you knock on. If out of twenty doors there is not one son of peace (Luke 10:5-6), something is wrong. It is easy to knock on twenty doors in one and a half hours.</p>
