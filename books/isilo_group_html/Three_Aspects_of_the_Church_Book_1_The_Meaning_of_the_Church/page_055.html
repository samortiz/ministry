<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TEMPLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">The Temple</h2>
<p>The temple and the tabernacle reveal two aspects of the church, each appearing in two different periods of Israel&rsquo;s history. During the time of Israel&rsquo;s sojourning in the wilderness, there was the tabernacle; after Israel settled down in Canaan, there was the temple. In its move, it was the tabernacle, and in its residence, it was the temple. Just as the tabernacle is a type of the church, the temple is also a type of the church. Everything related to the tabernacle, which typifies the church, is included in the temple. Nevertheless, there are a few items of the church that are not spoken of in relation to the type of the tabernacle. These items require the supplement of the temple; likewise, some items of the church require the supplement of the tabernacle. When the aspects of the tabernacle and the temple are considered together, the church can be completely and clearly explained.</p>
<p>There are four related aspects to the types of the tabernacle and temple. First, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the Lord Jesus Himself. In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; At that time the Jews did not understand what this word meant, but later the disciples understood that the Lord was referring to His body. The Lord Jesus was the temple of God on earth. The Jews used the hands of the Gentiles to destroy the body of the Lord Jesus, but after three days He was raised from the dead (vv. 21-22). This clearly shows that the Lord Jesus is the temple.</p>
<p>Second, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the church. Just as the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth, the temple also was God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth.</p>
<p>Third, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the individual saints. First Corinthians 6:19 says that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, a temple of God. In the tabernacle there were three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. The temple was also composed of these three sections. Both types reveal that we as individuals are composed of three parts: body, soul, and spirit (1 Thes. 5:23).</p>
<p>Fourth, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the New Jerusalem. In the new heavens and the new earth, the temple will be enlarged into a city, the New Jerusalem. There will be no temple in the New Jerusalem because the temple will be enlarged into a city (Rev. 21:22). Today God&rsquo;s dwelling can be likened to a house, but in eternity God&rsquo;s dwelling will be a city. The house will be enlarged into a city.</p>
<p>In considering the temple as a type of the church, we need to pay special attention to the builders, the material, and the way the temple was built.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Builders</h2>
<h2 class="head4">David</h2>
<p>Two persons built the temple: David and Solomon. Both David and Solomon typify Christ. David typifies Christ in His sufferings, and Solomon typifies Christ in glory. The temple was built by these two persons. In a strict sense, Solomon built the temple, but David cannot be excluded because he had much to do with its building.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Desire</h2>
<p>David&rsquo;s desire was to find a dwelling place for God and to build a resting place for God. This desire typifies Christ&rsquo;s desire. Second Samuel 7 and Psalm 132 both record that David swore to find a resting place for God. David had a strong desire and made an oath because the Ark of God did not have a dwelling place. The Ark was God&rsquo;s representative on earth. The fact that the Ark did not have a dwelling place indicated that God did not have a dwelling place on earth. When Christ came to the earth, He desired to find a dwelling place for God and to build a resting place for God, that is, to establish the church as God&rsquo;s resting place on earth. Hence, the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Without the church, God does not have a dwelling place or a resting place on the earth.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 1, The Meaning of the Church &nbsp; pg 55</div><br></body></html>
