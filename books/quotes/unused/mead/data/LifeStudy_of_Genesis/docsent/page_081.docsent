   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOD'S REDEEMED PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul warned us to build the church in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most of the work among Christians is not with gold, silver or pearl, and precious stone, but with wood, grass, and straw.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As gold in typology signifies the divine nature, wood represents our human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, wood is versus gold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are fond of saying that we are all human, especially when we make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we should not make our humanity an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our humanity must be a resurrected humanity, for the natural humanity is inadequate for the building of God's church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The building of the church requires a transformed humanity, not a humanity of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Grass is versus silver.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible tells us that all flesh is grass Isa 40:6; 1 Pet 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Grass typifies the people having become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Grass is not solid like wood; it is weak and fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, grass represents the fallen nature of man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The last item that Paul mentions in 1 Corinthians 3:12 is straw.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Straw is the stock or stem of a crop which remains after the grain has been threshed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Straw, which comes out of the ground, is versus the precious stone, which is a transformed substance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 3:12 presents a vivid contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wood is a tree without fruit, and straw is a crop without grain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not be wood or straw, materials that will be burned away and that are useless for the building of God's church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the Lord's building, we need the divine gold, the regenerated pearl, and the transformed precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we have of these items, the easier it will be for us to be built together spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we experience the gold, pearl, and precious stones, we will not only be the precious materials, but also a building fitly joined together to form a habitation of God in our spirit Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, transformation is for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to pray about these matters and fellowship concerning them that the Lord may bring us all into the reality of transformation for His building.</S>
