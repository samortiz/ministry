	 <h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO THOROUGHLY KNOW LIFE,<br />
THE CHURCH, AND THE KINGDOM<br />
IN ORDER TO MEET GOD&rsquo;S NEED IN THE PRESENT AGE</h2>
<p>As I observed the situation, I asked the co-workers, especially the senior co-workers, to consider certain things. We can say with a clear conscience, that from the time we began to serve the Lord until today, we had no intention to be in Christianity. Neither do we intend to create our own sect. We do not covet anything. We only want to keep a pure conscience and to hold the light of the truth that we have seen. The attitude of Christianity toward us merely causes us to focus on the matters that we received from the Lord. I spent a considerable amount of time before the Lord concerning these matters in order to know how we should proceed.</p>
<p>Just as Brother Sparks and the brothers who gathered in Scotland carefully considered the way that the Lord wants them to take and the work that they should do, we also feel that we should focus on certain things. First of all, we need to know life. We may be familiar with the word <em>life,</em> but we should not treat life as a term. Next, we need to know the church, and then we need to know the kingdom. These three items are comprehensive. Life is the most comprehensive; it includes the knowledge and the experience of life. We should also have a thorough understanding of the two aspects of the church. We should know the ground and the way of the church and the content and the reality of the church. In addition, we need to know the truth and the reality of the kingdom.</p>
<p>If we, the co-workers, do not have sufficient knowledge concerning life, the church, and the kingdom, we will not be able to meet the need of this age. If we only preach the gospel with zeal and hold revival meetings, just as Christianity does, we will not be able to meet this need. The work that God wants to carry out in this age is rejected by the world and ignored by Christianity. The Protestant denominations have expressed their attitude in their opposition to us. This does not mean that they have not done anything for God. They preach the gospel, but merely preaching the gospel cannot meet the need of God in this age. Therefore, we are forced to rise up to meet God&rsquo;s need in this age. If we merely have some knowledge of the truth and are zealous for the gospel, this need will not be met. We need a thorough understanding of life, the church, and the kingdom.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not sufficient for the brothers who labor to merely be zealous for the gospel and have some knowledge of the truth. This cannot meet the need of this age, nor will it meet our own need. There is a situation in our midst that we cannot cope with unless we know life, the church, and the kingdom.</p>
<p>We gave many messages concerning the content and the testimony of the church. The brothers and sisters need to review these messages. Then they will receive new light. When we studied the book of Ephesians, we spoke concerning the content and the testimony of the church. This is the hidden aspect of the church. The messages that were released in the last year mainly covered matters concerning the visible aspect of the church, that is, the ground and the way of the church. We also need to know this aspect of the church.</p>
<p>There is also the truth concerning the kingdom. The chapter entitled &ldquo;Entering into the Kingdom of the Heavens&rdquo; in <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</em> is on the kingdom. Even though this book covers practical matters, it gives a clear presentation of the truth. However, the chapter on the kingdom does not say much concerning the reality of the kingdom. It is focused on spiritual authority. I recently gave a message in Manila on what the kingdom is to the believers, in which I emphasized the reality of the kingdom. Then I gave several messages in Hong Kong concerning what the kingdom is to the church. The messages given in Manila and in Hong Kong provide a thorough explanation of the reality of the kingdom and supplement the chapter on entering into the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The saints who are co-workers need to know where we are, the situation we are in, what our need is, what our focus should be, and what we should be doing. We can then work out something that will meet our need and also meet the need of this age. We must not merely be zealous for the gospel, have some knowledge of the truth, and give a few messages to help the saints to be zealous, to be revived, and to serve. This is not enough. We must see the crucial matters of life, the church, and the kingdom.</p>
<p>If our eyes are opened to these three matters and we have a thorough understanding of them, our work will begin to meet the need of this age. The district meetings in Taipei lack life, the church, and the reality of the kingdom. This lack cannot be met by a little knowledge of the truth; rather, we need a vision. I cannot force the brothers and sisters to see, nor can I help them see. All I can do is fellowship. May the Spirit operate within us and give us the desire to see these three great visions.</p>
