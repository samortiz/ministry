   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Fear of Men</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some people dare not confess because they are afraid of men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people can honestly say that they have no other reservation in their heart; they are willing to stand up and confess, but when they see the faces of others, they become afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When they look at their parents faces or their friends faces, they feel too shy to speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is where many people are stumbled; they are afraid of men and do not have any boldness to open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some people are naturally timid; they are timid not only in confessing the Lord but also in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you want them to tell others about their faith, you are asking them for their life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They simply dare not open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, this kind of person needs to hear what God has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Proverbs 29:25 says, The fear of man bringeth a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are afraid when you see someone, you will fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as you become afraid, you fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your fear becomes your snare.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever your heart is afraid of men, you are creating a snare for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once you are afraid, you fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This snare is created by your own fear.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, the person you fear may be very willing to listen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if he is not inclined to listen, he may not be as fearsome as you think.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a story about two persons who were colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One was a believer and the other was not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The one who believed was very timid; the one who did not believe was also very timid.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The timid believer did not dare tell his colleague that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The one who did not believe was puzzled by the great changes that were happening to his colleague.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His colleague used to have a quick temper but had now changed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He dared not ask his colleague the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The two of them shared a table and sat face-to-face every day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One was too timid to speak, and the other was too timid to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every day they just looked at each other.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One was afraid to speak, and the other was afraid to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day the believer could not hold back any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After praying about it, he went to the other one and shook his hand tightly and said, I am a very timid person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For at least three months I have been struggling to tell you something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now I am going to tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have believed in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After saying these words, his face turned pale.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The other one said, I too have waited for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I wanted to ask why you have become so different, but I was too afraid to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The believer mustered enough courage to open his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From that time on, the opportunity opened up, and he was able to bring his friend to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are fearful of men will fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please remember that while you are afraid of others, others may be afraid of you too.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must never have a fear of men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We who follow God should not fear men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you have a fear of men, you cannot be a good Christian and you cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A Christian must be bold to speak to his relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He must be bold to confess the Lord both in private and in public.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must take this way from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. Being Shy</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people are shy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They feel that it is a shameful thing to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is true that this kind of shame may exist when we face unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you tell others that you are engaged in technical research, they will congratulate you for having a good future.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you say that you are studying a certain philosophy, others will also say that you are a thoughtful person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You are not ashamed to talk about doing many things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if you say that you are a Christian, many will say that you are too simple-minded or not intellectual enough.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They will not esteem you highly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You are not ashamed to talk about other things, but as soon as you confess your Christian faith, you feel ashamed within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is unavoidable for a new believer to feel shameful when he opens his mouth to confess his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, we must overcome this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is true that the world feels shameful about someone becoming a Christian, but we must overcome this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How can we overcome this feeling of shame?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must deal with it from two aspects:</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the one hand, we have to realize that when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He bore our sins as well as our shame.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When our Lord bore our sins, He suffered great humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today, in the eyes of God, it is only proper that we suffer humiliation from men.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The humiliation we suffer before man can never be compared with the humiliation our Lord suffered on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we should not be surprised at humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should know that we belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the other hand, there is a good hymn which says, Our shyness is like the early morning sky disowning the sun!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But the Lord radiates the divine light which illuminates our consciences which are as dark as the night.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since the Lord has been gracious to us and has redeemed us, being ashamed of confessing Him is like the early morning sky being ashamed of the illumination of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today the Lord has graced us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He has redeemed us and preserved us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He will even bring us to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet we consider it a shame to confess Him!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If that is a shame, then all the grace we have received should also be considered a shame to us, and we should deny it all!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord has done so much for us, and yet we feel ashamed of confessing Him!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should feel shameful for such things as carousing, drunkenness, unrestrained dissipation, works of darkness, sinning, and evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lord has delivered us from all these.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should feel glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How can we have a sense of shame?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is not shameful for us to confess the Lord; it is glorious and joyous for us to confess Him!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are those who will never perish, who will never be condemned or judged by God, and who will never have to depart from the glorious face of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We are those who follow the Lamb and who will always be with Him Rev 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is altogether wrong for others to plant the seed of shame in us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should stand up boldly and say that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should rejoice and glory in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>By nature Peter was a strong-willed person.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He wanted to distinguish himself among the disciples and to be ahead of others in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But one day he denied the Lord and became like a little mouse.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When he was questioned, he was afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Humanly speaking, Peter was a hero and a born leader among the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Yet he trembled even before others tried to take his life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He trembled and swore when all that was said to him was, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This was indeed too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>All those who refuse to confess the Lord are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Peter was most shameful; it was a shame for him to deny the Lord Matt 26:69-75 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>All those who are too shy to open their mouths are full of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The really noble ones are the ones who confess their allegiance to Jesus of Nazareth, even at the point of being burned at the stake or thrown into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They may be beaten, burned alive, or thrown into the lions den, but they still proclaim, I belong to Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the most glorious thing in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The most shameful ones are those who are ashamed to confess the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This kind of people are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>They will even loathe themselves and be ashamed of themselves!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The most shameful thing is for a person to despise himself and be ashamed of what he has.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Therefore, we should not have any fear or shame.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>All those who learn to follow the Lord should learn to confess Him boldly before man.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If light is shameful and darkness glorious, if holiness is shameful and sin glorious, if spirituality is shameful and carnality glorious, and if following the Lord is shameful and following man glorious, then we would rather choose shame.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We would rather suffer humiliation with Christ as Moses did, which humiliation is far better than the glories of men Heb 11:26 .</S>
