[1]  Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3:
[2]  Hence, we can say that we are doing an average job in the gospel, we are not strong in the church life, we have no goal concerning the truth, and we have no accomplishments in spirituality and in life.
[3]  ON A CONSIDERATION OF OUR HISTORY 2 THE BLESSING OF THE TRUTH
[4]  In serving the Lord in the localities, we must understand that people are our capital.
[5]  We cannot go to a place and merely lead the saints to study the Bible or help them to be spiritual; neither should we be satisfied with a few saints gathering together.
[6]  Suppose we only preserve a group of older saints by leading them to study the Bible and be spiritual, and after twenty years we still have the same group of saints but no new ones have been added.
[7]  We are able to maintain a certain number of people, because we have the church life, but if we reject the church life, we will have nothing, not even numbers.
[8]  If these messages cannot be put into practice, they should not be spoken.
[9]  We frequently waste time and lead the saints the wrong way.
[10]  As long as we meet in districts and in groups, we will be able to keep the new believers in the church life, they will become the second generation of the church, and we can educate and perfect them.
[11]  FOR CHURCH SERVICE THE PATTERN OF THE LORD JESUS
[12]  Christianity s belief in organization is based on the apostles appointing seven men to serve tables.
[13]  More than thirty years ago we began the service in Taipei.
[14]  It was truly the Lord s leading that in six to seven years we had an increase of one hundred percent; our numbers reached fifty thousand.
[15]  We never expected that he did not care for the ground of the church and for the practice of the church; he did not even care if there was a church.
[16]  From the speaking of the saints from Taipei, we can see that many of them can quote the Bible and the ministry books.
[17]  When I returned to Taiwan in 1966 and in 1967, there were four thousand children in the children s meetings, and I told the brothers to set a goal of having ten thousand children in the meetings.
[18]  I also asked the brothers to perfect the junior high and high school brothers and sisters to assist in teaching the children.
[19]  These children would be gospel seeds in junior high school, they would be gospel seeds in high school, and they would be gospel seeds in college.
[20]  If we had had ten thousand children in the children s work, there would be at least five thousand saints in the church life today.
[21]  Even though we have been busy in the church life, there are not more than three thousand five hundred saints in the meetings of the church in Taipei.
[22]  If we say Amen to this word and if we want the church in Taipei to have thirty thousand saints, we need to recover the seventeen thousand saints who do not meet regularly.
[23]  AND ELIMINATING OPINIONS LAYING A FOUNDATION OF THE TRUTH
[24]  Question: How do we have a deeper study of the truths that require further development, such as the twelve precious stones in the New Jerusalem?
[25]  And how can we be kept from pursuing the truth in a natural way so that we are not led astray?
[26]  We have continually emphasized the importance of the truth, hoping that all the saints would know the truth, but the truth can be useful only in the hands of a person who knows the flesh.
[27]  Before I left Taipei, there were about four thousand saints who attended the meetings in the halls on the Lord s Days; there were never less than at least three thousand saints.
[28]  Question: At the beginning of the one-year training we sensed that the burden of the leading brothers was to gather together ones who have a heart for the Lord from each locality and to lead us in a way that is similar to operating a normal school, such as a school for training teachers.
[29]  If during the past twenty years we had faithfully carried out some education, then even if we did not have the teachers, we would have an educational system in place, and the saints would be somewhat built up.
[30]  Question: If we have not graduated from elementary school, is it all right for us to teach at the kindergarten level?
[31]  Today as we preach the Lord Jesus, expound the Bible and spiritual matters, and build up the churches, we must carry out a spiritual education; otherwise, the church will have no future.
[32]  The people who have left the Lord s recovery have a hard time in their daily living, because even though they dare not say that the church is wrong, they are not willing to return to the church.
[33]  In this message we will consider the way that the church in Taipei should go on.
[34]  Most localities began with ten to twenty saints and then gradually increased, but few localities ever reached one hundred saints.
[35]  In 1933 the church in Shanghai was one of the few localities that had more than one hundred saints.
[36]  At the time the whole church preached the gospel, and we used the expression the church preaching the gospel.
[37]  We learn the proper lessons from studying our past.
[38]  I have said in the past that we should train the brothers and sisters who plan to go abroad to study or work so that they will not leave the church life due to changes in their environment.
[39]  Moreover, there are more than twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei, but less than one-fourth of them actually come to the meetings.
[40]  We need to find every one of the twenty thousand saints in order to understand the reason they are absent from the meetings.
[41]  It should not be that we use the Life-study messages until we find that they are not adequate and then switch to messages for edifying new believers until we find out that they do not meet the need and then switch to Twelve Baskets Full.
[42]  In relation to church service, we should make a list of the needs of the church.
[43]  After we pray about the services, we should assign responsible saints to different services according to the need.
[44]  We have been preaching the gospel in Taipei for nearly thirty years, and now there are approximately five thousand saints who attend the meetings.
[45]  All the saints who are in the meetings have received some perfecting, but we must study how we can meet their need.
[46]  Some of the saints who are not in the meetings may be open to receive a burden for the gospel; hence, we must study and find a way to contact these saints and develop their function in preaching the gospel.
[47]  In our coordination we need saints to preach the gospel, and we also need saints to preach the gospel truths.
[48]  I hope that the younger generation will receive this word and pursue the truth, instead of shouting that they have seen a vision.
[49]  Some people say that they understand the Bible, but they do not know the truth; they have not labored on the truth.
[50]  Question: When we fellowship, we feel that we are clear and that we have a way to go on, but after we return to our localities, we gradually lose our clarity, and we do not know what to do.
[51]  Now that we know to pursue the truth in serving the church, we should not say with fear that we will not know what to do when we return to our localities.
[52]  It is not a question of whether we are in a big church or in a small church, or whether we are a full-time co-worker or an elder or a responsible brother in the church.
[53]  In this message we will fellowship concerning the way that the Lord s work should go forward in Taiwan.
[54]  In order for us to have a thorough understanding of the work, we must have an overall view of the progression of church history, and we must understand the general situation of Christianity today.
[55]  Since A.D. 570, after the papal system was established, Roman Catholics have followed the orders of the pope.
[56]  In 1920 the Lord raised us up in China.
[57]  We did not do something on our own in order to have a unique style.
[58]  Instead, we studied church history and compared everything with the Bible.
[59]  Today in every sector and profession in the world there is much progress.
[60]  Since 1961, when I went to America to start the work there, I have returned to Taiwan almost every year, but the situation of the church here is not satisfactory.
[61]  However, this time when I saw the saints sharing in the conference and heard their responses to the messages, I was surprised.
[62]  This has created a golden opportunity for the Lord s recovery; the church is doing well, and there are many useful saints.
[63]  May we consider the way two thousand years of church history has ended in today s situation and then look at what the Lord is doing among us, that is, at how much light He has given us, and His blessing of us and our environment.
[64]  HAVING A BRIGHT FUTURE THE LIVING WAY WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE
[65]  The way of serving the Lord full time is the way of the cross; it is a way that leads to death, a way without any future.
[66]  I never thought that I would go to America.
[67]  In 1938 a saint from Beijing sent me two checks; one check was for a round-trip ticket to America, and the other was to cover the living expenses for my wife and children in China for one year.
[68]  I replied that I did not have the burden to go to America, and I asked her what I should do with the checks.
[69]  In 1949, when the Lord brought me to Taiwan, the Lord s recovery was only among the Chinese-speaking saints; there were approximately one hundred churches in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.
[70]  In Africa the Lord s testimony began in Ghana.
[71]  When I began the work in America, I was clear that my burden was not to do a Chinese-speaking work, because if I did such a work, the English-speaking work would be neglected.
[72]  If we wanted to do a Chinese-speaking work, we should not have gone to America.
[73]  When I observed that many brothers and sisters who immigrated to the United States were not receiving any care, I fellowshipped with the Chinese brothers and told them that we had to begin to pay attention to the work among the Chinese-speaking.
[74]  Serving the Lord requires time and energy; thus, we need some saints who will offer up their time and their energy.
[75]  However, we should not have the concept that as soon as we offer ourselves up, we are a preacher.
[76]  If the Lord moves in our environment so that our living is provided for, then we can serve Him full time.
[77]  If the Lord does not provide for our living in this way, we must have a job.
[78]  Paul was a full-time serving one, but there were times when the churches did not support him; that is, the offerings from the saints were not sufficient.
[79]  We should not say that when we are full-time serving ones, we are members of the clergy or that we have entered a religious organization.
[80]  Even though some brothers do not serve full time, we cannot say that they are not co-workers or that they are not in the Lord s recovery.
[81]  We must be clear that this is the Lord s leading, and we must have faith that the Lord will bless His church.
[82]  CHAPTER NINE THE TREASURES IN THE LORD S RECOVERY SERVING IN THE CHURCH ARMY FOR TWO YEARS
[83]  By the Lord s leading, we hope that all of the college students among us will give the first two years after their graduation to the Lord, just as the young men in Taiwan do for military service.
[84]  When we give to the Lord, we receive from the Lord.
[85]  When we are touched by the Lord to give a material offering, we feel to give a certain amount, but after considering our offering, we often cut the amount in half.
[86]  If we love the Lord, the church, and the Lord s recovery, we cannot continue to be satisfied with only six thousand saints in the meetings for five years.
[87]  If we truly love the Lord, we will have five thousand saints one year, eight thousand the next year, and thirteen thousand saints the following year.
[88]  My burden is that we would enter into the truth.
[89]  If you are willing to read one message a day in this way for six days every week, in one year you will be able to read three hundred messages, and in four years you will have read all the New Testament Life-study messages.
[90]  The third item of the basic truths is God s redemption.
[91]  First Corinthians 6:11 says that we were washed, we were sanctified, and we were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
[92]  The Lord s blood redeems us; it redeems us from our sins, forgives us of our sins, cleanses us from our sins, sanctifies us, justifies us before God, reconciles us to God, and causes us to be accepted by God.
[93]  In addition to studying the Life-study messages and the basic truths, we must study some important terms in the Lord s recovery.
[94]  We must study God; that means we must study the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Jehovah God.
[95]  Hence, in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus repeatedly said that the Father was with Him and that the Father never left Him v. 29; 16:32 . John 14 records how Philip asked the Lord to show the Father to the disciples, and the Lord Jesus said to Philip, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? vv.
[96]  Life is another item of the treasures in the Lord s recovery.
[97]  I did not place life further up on the list, because life is related to experience; it is not a doctrine.
[98]  Life depends upon our experience; hence, we must study our experiences to see how we were regenerated, how we are being transformed, how we will mature, and so forth.
[99]  The Gospel of John and the book of Colossians are two books in the Bible that speak of Christ as life in a clear and definite way.
[100]  When we compared our observations to our experience, we learned that the Lord s way, which is the same as the way shown in the Bible, is multifaceted.
[101]  When we serve in the church, we must remember the word multifaceted.
[102]  Hence, we should not wish that there would be only older saints in the church and no young people; neither should we wish that there would be only young saints in the church and no older ones.
[103]  Suppose in a family there is only a sixty-year-old couple and their eighty-year-old parents.
[104]  If our testimony includes these four aspects of being rich and clear concerning the truth, matured in life, corporate in our church life, and zealous for the gospel, we will have the true testimony of the Lord in the local churches.
[105]  SEEING THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN COLOSSIANS Being Rooted in Christ,
[106]  If we want to grow in life, we must be rooted in Christ Col 2:7 .
[107]  The Lord s recovery is multifaceted, and it requires us to care for the truth, life, the church, and the gospel.
[108]  When we sing Hymns, #456, we will certainly set our will to live for the Lord.
[109]  The chorus of Hymns, #456 says, O Jesus, Lord and Savior, / I give myself to Thee, / For Thou, in Thy atonement, / Didst give Thyself for me.
[110]  Not only does the Lord not want our self; He even tells us that we should not want our self.
[111]  But the Lord answered, Get behind Me, Satan! v. 23 . Then He continued, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself v. 24 . Hence, the Bible clearly tells us to deny ourselves; it does not want us to give ourselves to the Lord.
[112]  They think that this verse speaks of presenting ourselves to God, but if we consider the context of this verse, we will see that yourselves does not refer merely to us as those who have been raised from the dead; it refers also to our members.
[113]  If we do not have the light of the truth when we sing this hymn, we will offer ourselves to God and think that we can do something great for Him.
[114]  We should not consider living for Christ; instead, we must realize that we have already been crucified with Christ, that we have died, and that it is Christ who lives in us.
[115]  In 1949 we came to Taiwan to start the work.
[116]  Before then I was in Shanghai, where we had gained a group of young people, most of whom were students, and some had been saved through my preaching of the gospel.
[117]  Around 1958 these saints felt that their wings had grown and that they could fly, so they told people, Brother Lee is finished, and the brothers who serve with him are ready to be put into coffins.
[118]  I hope you are all clear that we are all brothers in the Lord, and even though I was the one who led you in the beginning, we are still all brothers.
[119]  It is precious to consecrate ourselves to serve full time, but we must not bring in our natural life.
[120]  After we were raised up by the Lord, none of us had any desire to do anything for ourselves.
[121]  Therefore, we did not have any problems, and no one played tricks in the Lord s recovery.
[122]  I led the church in a certain locality, building up the church there, but I never felt that the church was built up by me, or that it was in my pocket.
[123]  By the Lord s mercy the church in Chefoo was built up mainly through my ministry; however, I never considered the church in Chefoo to be my personal church.
[124]  We also need to take care of the work in the schools.
[125]  The city of Taipei has about one hundred twenty thousand university students, eighty thousand technical college students, fifty thousand high school students, and one hundred forty thousand junior high school students.
[126]  The young brothers and sisters who serve full time should be assigned to preach the gospel in the schools.
[127]  OF THE LORD S RECOVERY EVERYONE BEING MOBILIZED TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
[128]  For many years the number of saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei has been around four to five thousand.
[129]  The spiritual life of the saints has been maintained through their meeting regularly, and they have grown in life.
[130]  Many brothers and sisters are growing, and many new brothers and sisters are being brought into the church life.
[131]  Even though four to five thousand is not a large number, if the saints rise up to move corporately, it will be significant and profitable, and we will be able to accomplish something.
[132]  I say this because at least three thousand five hundred saints stood up in the meeting to express their desire to bring one person to the Lord every year.
[133]  By the Lord s mercy, I have been serving Him for more than fifty years.
[134]  First, how do we support the new believers so that we do not lose them after they are saved?
[135]  It is simple to care for a small church with only thirty to fifty saints, but suppose the church in Taipei doubled its number from five thousand saints to ten thousand; how would we care for its administration?
[136]  If we are unclear concerning the truth, do not have growth in life, and do not participate in the church life, the result of our leading people to be saved will be the abandonment of many babies along the roadside.
[137]  If we can lead five people to salvation in a year, that is the Lord s mercy; however, we must support them after they are saved.
[138]  For the building up of the church, we must not merely be zealous to preach the gospel; we must also have the truth, life, and the church as our foundation.
[139]  We must also have a practical living in the church life.
[140]  Even though the brothers are busy with their occupations and the sisters are busy with their households, we still must quietly consider how to properly apportion our time.
[141]  Everyone should have a schedule in which we clearly list what we will do for the week.
[142]  We are all busy, and we have many things that we must do; however, in order to learn to do things according to their importance and urgency, we should make a schedule.
[143]  For example, when we receive a letter, we do not need to read it immediately if it is not urgent.
[144]  Since we have so many things to take care of and not enough time for all of them, we must learn to take care of things in the order of their importance and urgency.
[145]  If all the saints know the truth, have some growth in life, and live the normal church life, they will not be sidetracked or get into trouble regardless of how crazy they are when they preach the gospel or how thick their skin is.
[146]  You should never think that we are one of the many groups in Christianity.
[147]  We believe that this is what the Lord wants us to do, and we also believe that if we are faithful, the Lord s grace will take us on in this way.
[148]  When we go out to preach the gospel, we should not think that we are great gospel preachers who can bring one hundred people to salvation.
[149]  We must be humble and understand that everything we have is in the church and that the result of all our labor must be turned over to the church.
[150]  Wherever we go, we do not criticize, nor do we say, This church is not as good as another local church.
[151]  In the past few conference meetings more than six hundred saints have consecrated all their time for the Lord s work and service, and another group of more than six hundred saints have consecrated themselves to be part-time for the Lord s work and service.
[152]  We will thoroughly fellowship with all the saints concerning the leading we have received from the Lord, the vision we have seen, and the way we must take in order to go on.
[153]  A REVIEW OF THE MOVE OF THE LORD S RECOVERY
[154]  The church there was raised up and established by the apostles.
[155]  In other words, it is difficult to find a pattern of a large church in the New Testament; the New Testament does not record another church that had more than a thousand believers or that had more than ten thousand believers.
[156]  Hence, it is difficult to know how to build up a local church that has a large number of saints and how to spread in such a local church.
[157]  It was not until after 1940 that there was a church in the Lord s recovery, the church in Chefoo, where the number of saints increased from a little over one hundred to several hundred.
[158]  Beginning in 1946, a small number of saints began migrating to Taiwan.
[159]  When I came to Taiwan in the spring of 1949, there were less than one hundred saints in the church in Taipei.
[160]  In other words, we began with a small number of less than five hundred saints, and in six to seven years we experienced a one hundredfold increase we had fifty thousand saints.
[161]  THE KEY FOR THE GOING ON OF THE CHURCH Strengthening the Leading at the Basic Level
[162]  Why do we pay so much attention to the situation in Taipei?
[163]  First, it is rare for a church in the Lord s recovery to have more than ten thousand saints.
[164]  Second, even though the church in Taipei has not increased in numbers for more than twenty years, the church has been growing in life.
[165]  The church in Taipei of approximately six hundred saints has been formed into districts by joining fifty or so small groups together.
[166]  If we want the condition of every small group to be the same, every saint to be equal, and every household to be alike, the co-workers need to advance this practice among the saints.
[167]  The condition of the church in Taipei shows that the greatest need in the work in encouraging the small groups is to recover the dormant saints.
[168]  As the co-workers are encouraging the small groups, they should give the brothers and sisters in the groups a list of the dormant saints who are in their neighborhood.
[169]  For a dormant saint to be recovered into the church life, we should not only hold a gospel meeting in his home; rather, we should ask him to preach the gospel message.
[170]  Our goal is not merely to draw people to the meetings.
[171]  The full-time co-workers must be trained, and they must pray much when they go to help the saints enter into their function.
[172]  We need to pray desperately for every family that we are responsible for, and we must pray for every saint by name.
[173]  Then according to the burden that we receive from the Lord, we should go to care for and encourage the saints one by one until they begin to function in their service.
[174]  This is not the practice in the Lord s recovery, because we want to perfect the saints who are not apostles to be apostles and to perfect the saints who are not prophets to be prophets and to perfect the saints who are not teachers to be teachers.
[175]  In addition to these things, the church here has several thousand saints who meet regularly.
[176]  If we would preach the gospel in this way, it would be equivalent to having five thousand Mr. Moody s. Who knows how many people we would bring to salvation? This depends on the leading at the basic level, that is, the leading in the small groups, where the co-workers encourage and perfect the saints.
[177]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You, and we humble our hearts before You.
[178]  We hope that all the young brothers and sisters will consecrate themselves to the Lord and to the church after they graduate from college and give a minimum of two years in full-time service for the Lord s work.
[179]  Among the saints in Taipei there are at least several thousand household units, and all of these households have children.
[180]  When we say children, we are referring to young people between the ages of six and twelve, that is, elementary school students from first through sixth grade.
[181]  By next summer, or at the latest by the end of next year, the church in Taipei can have at least five thousand children who are under the teaching of the brothers and sisters and who are listening to the truth every week.
[182]  If we are faithful and work together to carry out these matters and accomplish them, I believe that within half a year twenty thousand brothers and sisters on the island of Taiwan will be going on positively in a church life that involves recovering the dormant saints and gaining new ones.
[183]  In the past we went to meetings and listened to messages, and we also read spiritual books.
[184]  The full-timers and all the saints in all the churches in the Lord s recovery need to give themselves to be equipped with the truth.
[185]  John began by saying, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...In Him was life, and the life was the light of men...And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality...For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace...No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him 1:1, 4, 14, 16, 18 .
[186]  Then the saints in the churches will be like the children of an educated family.
[187]  When they open their mouths, the truth will flow out, and when they go out to preach the gospel, they will speak the truth.
[188]  If the young people among us speak the truth of Romans 8:1-13 to their parents, telling them that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into the tripartite man, I believe that their parents will be moved.
[189]  When we understand the truth, we should discuss the truth with other saints instead of talking about the weather and politics.
[190]  When we are soaked with the truth, we will be able to preach the gospel in our homes, on the campuses, to the children, and in the communities, and the Lord will have a way among us.
[191]  For example, the church in Kaohsiung should support the full-time serving ones in the area around Kaohsiung; the church in Taichung should support those who serve in the area around Taichung; the church in Keelung should support those who serve in the area around Keelung; the church in Taipei should support those who serve in the area around Taipei; and the church in Hualien should support those who serve in the area around Hualien.
[192]  At present, there are only five thousand saints meeting in the church in Taipei, but we hope that by next year we will have recovered more than three thousand of the dormant saints.
[193]  Prayer: Lord, we are still natural and in the old creation; we are even in the self and in the flesh.
[194]  I hope that those who serve the Lord full time will thoroughly study 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus with the outlines, footnotes, cross references, and Life-study messages.
[195]  In these thirteen chapters of the Bible, we must find and study the crucial points concerning those who serve the Lord.
[196]  These three books speak about the different conditions of the Lord s serving ones and give us the pattern of a serving one.
[197]  Hence, we must not read them in a shallow way, nor should we simply pick up the points that appeal to us.
[198]  For example, the full-time serving ones from Taipei must be approved by the church in Taipei, and the ones from Kaohsiung by the church in Kaohsiung.
[199]  Another situation involves sisters who are zealous for the Lord but do not care for family matters.
[200]  If a brother who serves the Lord does not have a good reputation outside the church, we must exhort him to correct the matter that caused him to have a poor reputation.
[201]  The groups are crucial, and we must take care of them.
[202]  All the local churches should go over their name lists to see how many saints in their localities meet regularly and how many are no longer meeting.
[203]  Thus, when the groups are formed, they should have less than twelve saints so that they can bring in new ones.
[204]  Question: Concerning full-time service, there is a brother who is about thirty-five years old.
[205]  If this brother s spiritual function clearly manifests that he should serve the Lord full time, then he should become a full-time serving one.
[206]  In this message we will fellowship concerning some of the spiritual principles in the church service.
[207]  In the preceding messages we fellowshipped concerning the arrangements for the work and the way the full-time serving ones should lead the small groups and how they should advance the gospel in the homes, on the campus, and with the children.
[208]  The full-time serving ones must also advance the gospel in the community through the brothers and sisters at all levels of society.
[209]  We must realize that we are in the Lord and that we are brothers and sisters.
[210]  We might think that in the church we should obey the elders.
[211]  However, there is not a verse in the Bible says only that the church belongs to the elders.
[212]  The Bible says only that the church is the church, or the churches, of God 1 Cor 1:2; 11:16 ; the church of Christ, or the churches, of Christ Rom 16:16 ; and the church of the saints 1 Thes 1:1 .
[213]  In other words, the owners of the church are God, the Lord, and the saints.
[214]  Second, since the affairs of the church are also practical and require human service, in matters related to service the owner of the church is not the elders but the saints.
[215]  This is the reason Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 5 that the saints should not make an accusation against the elders, except on the word of two or three witnesses v. 19 . The Bible does not speak of people making an accusation against their parents, but it does mention saints making an accusation against the elders.
[216]  We think that we should obey the elders because the church is under the elders control, administration, and management, but Paul still speaks of the saints being able to bring an accusation against the elders.
[217]  During the training on the Life-study of Matthew, we emphasized this matter in relation to the sisters who are the wives of elders, saying, You are all the wives of elders, and it seems that because your husbands are elders, you have become first ladies.
[218]  The New Testament speaks of the elders administrating of the church, but it does not stress this point.
[219]  Many Christians want to pursue such gifts, but in the Lord s recovery, the Lord does not give us such gifts, and neither do we pay attention to them.
[220]  There is a Chinese proverb that says, A long illness makes the patient a good doctor.
[221]  Even though we appoint elders in fear and trembling, we may still appoint someone who is not appropriate, and once the elders have been appointed, we cannot casually announce that we are changing them.
[222]  The full-timers, on the one hand, should learn to follow the sense of the Holy Spirit and the anointing.
[223]  When the elders in Taipei fellowship their need with the church in Kaohsiung, the elders in Kaohsiung should go to the saints who have a burden to serve in the campus work and ask whether they have a burden to serve in Taipei.
[224]  Prayer: Lord, we prostrate ourselves before You once again and look to You from the depths of our being.
[225]  Lord, we confess that we are still not clear.
[226]  Guide us, open us, empty us, and fill us with Your heart s desire so that we would be rid of the old things and become new, so that we would put off the old man and put on the new man.
[227]  If this question concerning being organic and being organizational is not resolved, we will have no way to go on and no way to make decisions.
[228]  Therefore, we need to spend some time to first fellowship concerning this matter.
[229]  We should not be anxious if we are unable to resolve this matter immediately, because God is very patient.
[230]  In theory we know that to serve full time is to live before the Lord and to let the Lord s life live out of us.
[231]  They have received a commission from the Lord concerning the church, and they should therefore act according to their fellowship with the Lord and according to the sense of life, the anointing, and the inward moving of the Spirit.
[232]  When we love our wives, submit to our husbands, or take care of our children, it seems as if we are only cultivating ourselves and putting our family in order, but in fact, having received mercy from the Lord, we are following the inward operation of the Triune God.
[233]  Before a brother is appointed as an elder, he may have had no sense of being anything but a saint who simply served the church.
[234]  In his second ministry journey, Paul went to Lystra, and the church recommended a young man named Timothy 16:1-2 .
[235]  He was not brought up by Paul; instead, he was brought up and recommended to Paul by a local church.
[236]  Now we will consider the practical application of our fellowship.
[237]  Suppose that in a local church there are some co-workers and many young full-time serving ones.
[238]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 2 THE ORGANIC FUNCTION OF THE BODY
[239]  Since we do not have the Lord s physical presence with us today, we cannot take Peter s experience as an example.
[240]  We have many young people who have a desire to serve full time.
[241]  ONE BODY, ONE WORK, AND ONE WAY OF RECOVERY
[242]  The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body is uniquely one.
[243]  When we were in Shanghai and Brother Nee was leading the church, some gifted ones came into our midst.
[244]  I hope the young brothers and sisters would see this way and would be able to say to me, Brother Lee, you have led us to take this way, but we want to tell you that even if you give it up, we will still take it.
[245]  If I gave you sweet soymilk to drink every day, it would be easy to say that this is the church, but since I give you hot and sour soup, it is not as easy to say that this is the church.
[246]  IN THE LORD S SPREADING TO THE WHOLE EARTH
[247]  The Lord is responsible for the spread of His work; it is not us.
[248]  Moreover, we should not expect that our service to the Lord will ensure that we have no problems or have a successful career.
[249]  We cannot say that the church is no longer the church when a cold wind blows, or that the church is the church when a warm wind blows.
[250]  In relation to our practice, we will fellowship concerning dividing into groups.
[251]  In the past we formed groups, but we gradually stopped practicing the groups.
[252]  After observing our situation and studying the practice of other Christian groups, we are clear that a local church must stress meeting in groups.
[253]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE WAY TO ADVANCE THE SMALL GROUPS THE CHURCH NEEDING TO ADVANCE THE GROUPS
[254]  In the previous message we fellowshipped concerning dividing into groups.
[255]  The church in Taipei has already formed over four hundred groups.
[256]  The church in Taipei currently has about four hundred serving ones, including elders, co-workers, deacons, those who minister the word, coordinators of various services, young full-timers, and part-timers.
[257]  In forming the groups, there should not be groups for brothers and groups for sisters or groups for elderly saints and groups for younger saints.
[258]  We should demonstrate and explain how to advance the group meetings.
[259]  Suppose a co-worker goes to lead and nurture a small group in which there are many sisters but only a few brothers.
[260]  This co-worker should not give a long message; rather, he should consider the saints as a family and greet them with an intimate concern.
[261]  Therefore, before we fellowship concerning the dormant saints, we should collect some information from the church business office, which will prepare the information cards of the dormant saints.
