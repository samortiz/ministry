[1]  OF MAN AFTER ADAM S FALL OUTLINE The condition before God: Having sinned.
[2]  Because men have sinned and violated God s righteousness, they are not only condemned under God s judgment, but they are also children of wrath Eph 2:3 under God s wrath John 3:36 .
[3]  People live in the lusts of their flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts; thus, they contradict God s righteousness and daily incite God s wrath.
[4]  Today God s wrath is waiting to explode on men like thunder ready to roar.
[5]  Since man s heart is deceitful above all things, desperately wicked, and filled with all kinds of unrighteousness and wickedness, it is naturally at enmity with God.
[6]  Men are hostile toward God in their thoughts, desires, and decisions.
[7]  Hence, they have become enemies of God Col 1:21 and sons of disobedience, walking according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who now is operating in them Eph 2:2 .
[8]  However, although people can know God, they test Him, try Him, refuse to know Him, disapprove of holding Him in their knowledge, and do not glorify Him as God nor thank Him, much less worship Him.
[9]  THE CONDITION UNDER SATAN S HAND A. Being a Child of the Devil
[10]  Men are not only sinful and corrupt, but they are also out of the Devil Satan and belong to the Devil 1 John 3:8a .
[11]  As descendants of fallen Adam, men are born children of the Devil, the evil one John 8:44; 1 John 3:10 , with a life that is mingled with the Devil s life and a nature that is mixed with Satan s nature.
[12]  It is not of our works nor of our willing or running, but of God, the One who shows mercy Rom 9:11, 15-16 .
[13]  When Esau and Jacob were in their mother s womb, not yet being born, nor having done anything good or bad, God told their mother that He chose the lesser, Jacob, but rejected the greater, Esau.
[14]  This proves that God did not choose Jacob because his works were good, nor did He reject Esau because his works were bad; for at that time they were not yet born, nor had they done anything good or bad.
[15]  God predestinated us not only according to the good pleasure of His will, but also with a purpose, a plan Eph 1:11 .
[16]  It is according to His purpose that He predestinated us.
[17]  His purpose was the plan which He made according to His will, that we might partake of His life and nature and have the position to enjoy and inherit all His riches.
[18]  God s calling is also according to His grace 2 Tim 1:9-10 .
[19]  This grace was given to us in Christ by God before times eternal.
[20]  LESSON TWENTY-EIGHT GOD S CALLING 2 OUTLINE A holy calling.
[21]  A heavenly calling: A calling of the divine hope.
[22]  The purpose of God s calling that the believers may: Come out of darkness and enter into God s marvelous light.
[23]  THAT THE BELIEVERS MAY: A. Come out of Darkness
[24]  According to the revelation in 1 Corinthians, Christ is the portion of the saints 1:2 ; He is God s power and God s wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us 1:24, 30 ; He is our glory 2:7 and the Lord of glory 2:8 ; He is the depths of God 2:10 ; He is the unique foundation of God s building 3:11 ; He is our Passover 5:7 , the unleavened bread 5:8 , the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock 10:3-4 ; He is the Head 11:3 and the Body 12:12 ; He is the firstfruit 15:20, 23 , the second Man 15:47 , and the last Adam 15:45b ; and as such He became the life-giving Spirit 15:45b .
[25]  God has called us also for the purpose that we may obtain the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ 2 Thes 2:14 .
[26]  After man sinned and fell, God s original purpose in creating man was lost; man could no longer contain or express God.
[27]  God, however, accomplished redemption for man, and He called His chosen ones unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth that they might obtain the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ 2 Thes 2:13-14 .
[28]  The glory of the Lord Jesus Christ is that Christ is the Son of God the Father, possessing the Father s life and nature to express Him.
[29]  AND MAN S REPENTANCE OUTLINE The Spirit s sanctification: The Holy Spirit s enlightening and seeking.
[30]  The Spirit convicting man concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.
[31]  Man s repentance: The meaning of repentance: To have a change of mind.
[32]  To turn from things other than God to the kingdom of God.
[33]  Man s repentance is the result of the Spirit s sanctifying work.
[34]  When the Spirit comes to enlighten man, seek man, and convict man concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment, He causes man to repent and turn to God.
[35]  In the Lord s gospel the purpose for man to be forgiven of his sins is that man may receive His life Col 2:13 .
[36]  Therefore, if a man desires to receive the Lord s life, he must repent Acts 11:18 .
[37]  Man must see that his life is corrupt and that his living, which is outside of God, is evil.
[38]  The Lord Jesus is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man, who died and was resurrected Luke 24:39-43 .
[39]  He was the Son of God, yet He partook of blood and flesh Heb 2:14 that He might undo the works of the Devil 1 John 3:8 .
[40]  Later, when the children of Israel sinned against God and were bitten by snakes Num 21:4-9 , God told Moses to lift up a serpent of brass, which would bear God s judgment in their place, so that anyone who would look at the brass serpent would live.
[41]  After the fall men became enemies of God Rom 5:10a .
[42]  However, through His death and the shedding of His blood on the cross, Christ has made peace between God and man Rom 5:10; Col 1:20 .
[43]  LESSON THIRTY-ONE BELIEVING 2 OUTLINE The means of believing.
[44]  Faith is a gift given to us by God through the divine revelation, which is the revelation of the Bible.
[45]  The entire Bible is a revelation of Christ, conveying as its contents the all-inclusive Christ in His all-inclusive person and His all-inclusive work.
[46]  When we read the Bible or hear a gospel preacher preaching this all-inclusive Christ according to the Bible, the Holy Spirit causes us to see the revelation of the all-inclusive person and work of Christ through the word of the Bible.
[47]  LESSON THIRTY-TWO BAPTISM 1 OUTLINE The importance of baptism: Being the initiation of the New Testament dispensation.
[48]  Refusing to be baptized being the nullification of the counsel of God.
[49]  Baptism is the counsel of God in His New Testament economy; it is also a part of His plan.
[50]  In those days the Pharisees and the lawyers who rejected and opposed the Lord refused to be baptized with the baptism of John; hence, they rejected, nullified, the counsel of God for themselves Luke 7:30 .
[51]  To be baptized is also to be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Acts 8:16; 19:5 .
[52]  In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus charged the disciples to baptize the believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[53]  Because the Lord Jesus is the embodiment of the processed Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Col 2:9 to baptize people into Him is to baptize them into the Triune God.
[54]  G. To Be Baptized into the Body of Christ
[55]  We were not only baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into the name of the Lord Jesus, into Christ, and into the death of Christ; we were also baptized into the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:13 , into one organic entity, with Christ as its life and constituent, to express Christ.
[56]  All the believers in Christ, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body.
[57]  Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ.
[58]  Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Peter told us that Noah s household of eight passing through the flood in the ark was a type of baptism.
[59]  LESSON THIRTY-THREE BAPTISM 2 OUTLINE The relationship between baptism and salvation: Through baptism man being regenerated and entering into the kingdom of God.
[60]  Through baptism man being forgiven of his sins and receiving the Holy Spirit.
[61]  Anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus is qualified to be baptized, because the Word says, He who believes and is baptized...
[62]  When those in Samaria believed Philip, bringing the good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women Acts 8:12 .
[63]  Once a person has believed in the Lord, he must be baptized immediately and not wait one moment.
[64]  On the day of Pentecost, when the three thousand received the gospel preached by Peter, they believed in the Lord and were baptized immediately Acts 2:41 .
[65]  We, the believers, are joined to God the Son because God has first shined Him into our hearts 2 Cor 4:6 .
[66]  When we heard the gospel, not only did we hear some preaching or teaching, but even more we received a divine illumination.
[67]  This illumination enables us to know the gospel of the glory of Christ, which illuminates, radiates, and shines in our hearts so that we may know the gospel, receive Christ, and have an organic union with Christ.
[68]  When God shines Christ into our heart, He brings Christ into us that we may believe and receive Him as our life and everything John 1:12; Col 2:6a .
[69]  We were not only raised together with Christ but also seated together with Him in the heavenlies Eph 2:6b , in the highest place in the universe.
[70]  God s salvation is to save us to a position that is far above all the enemies of God.
[71]  The Spirit is also the anointing ointment in the believers to anoint them 2 Cor 1:21; Heb 1:9b; 1 John 2:20, 27 .
[72]  His moving, His action, is a kind of anointing to add more of the elements of the Triune God into them.
[73]  The Spirit is also the firstfruit Rom 8:23 in the believers that they may have a foretaste of all that the processed Triune God is.
[74]  The Holy Spirit s being poured out upon the believers, His falling upon them, is to clothe them Luke 24:49 , to be joined to them.
[75]  Concerning the Spirit of life, we need to breathe Him in as the breath; concerning the Spirit of power, we need to put Him on as the uniform that we may have the authority to carry out God s New Testament economy.
[76]  The foregoing points show us clearly that the Holy Spirit s coming to us is of two aspects: the inward aspect and the outward aspect; the essential aspect and the economical aspect; the aspect of life and the aspect of power.
[77]  He is in them as the Spirit of reality that they may have the reality of the divine Trinity and of the divine things realized in them: as the Spirit of life continually imparting into them God s eternal life until their whole being is filled with the Spirit of life; as the anointing ointment, typified by the holy anointing ointment in the Old Testament, anointing all the riches of the processed Triune God into them that they may be filled with His elements; as a seal to mark them out as God s possession and to impress them with the image of God that they may be like God and may express Him; as the pledge, the foretaste, guarantee, and sample, to guarantee that God and all that belongs to God are their eternal portion; as the firstfruit for them to have a fresh foretaste of all that the processed Triune God is and for them to expect a fuller enjoyment in the future; and as the blessing of God s promise, which is the fulfillment of the promise of God s New Testament economy.
[78]  LESSON THIRTY-SIX REDEMPTION 1 FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND FREEDOM OUTLINE Forgiveness of sins: The meaning of forgiveness of sins: Delivering the forgiven ones from the penalty of God s righteousness.
[79]  When God forgives us, He not only exempts us from suffering the penalty of sin and causes our sins to depart from us, but He also forgets our sins.
[80]  People think that God s forgiveness will cause man to become audacious and reckless.
[81]  Our experience tells us that the more we are forgiven by God, the more we fear Him; the more we have received the grace of God s forgiveness, the more we have the fear toward God.
