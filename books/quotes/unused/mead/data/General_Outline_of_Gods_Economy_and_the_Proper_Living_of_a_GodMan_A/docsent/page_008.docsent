   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT BEING ALSO THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 30 is a record concerning the building of the tabernacle, but in verses 22-30 God suddenly charged Moses to make the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way was to take one hin of olive oil and compound it together with four spices; thus, the oil became an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was one hin of olive oil the number "one" denotes God, referring to the element of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There were four spices the number "four" denotes man, referring to the element of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the mingling of these two is divinity plus humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, humanity involves four items: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In brief, myrrh signifies the precious death of Christ; fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death; calamus, which is a reed that grows in a marsh or muddy place and is able to shoot up into the air, signifies the precious and transcendent resurrection of Christ; and cassia signifies the power and the effectiveness of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this holy anointing oil, the aspect of divinity is not as involved as the aspect of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because Christ came to be a man, and, as a man, He died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His death produced an effect, and so did His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The holy anointing oil with four ingredients indicates that Christ has four elements: He died, and therefore there was the effectiveness of His death; He resurrected, and therefore there was the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are four elements.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, in the mingling of divinity with humanity, humanity also has these four elements.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The holy anointing oil as a type clearly portrays that the Spirit today has divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these items were compounded together to become the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament, 1 John 2:27 says that we have received the anointing from the Lord; this anointing is the compound Spirit typified by the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE APPLICATION OF GOD'S ECONOMY BY THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After Christ accomplished God's economy, the compound Spirit applies it to the people chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How does He do it?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He comes to be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He as the compound and consummated Spirit contains the elements of divinity, humanity, death, the effectiveness of His death, resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When this Spirit comes into us, God comes in, Christ as a person comes in, His death with its effectiveness comes in, and His resurrection with its power comes in. This is an all-inclusive dose that consists of the supply of God, the supply of Christ, the problem-solving and killing effect of Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection with its power.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Hebrew language, this is the power to guard against and repel the poison of insects and snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the dwellings of the Jews in ancient times, people were often hurt by snakes and insects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, they put some cassia in their houses for their own protection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Cassia emits an odor that repels snakes, centipedes, and scorpions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that the resurrection power of Christ can repel Satan, the evil spirits, and demons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE SPIRIT BEING MINGLED WITH US TO BRING FORTH THE CHURCH AND BECOMING THE SEVEN SPIRITS TO MEET THE CHURCH'S NEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today all that is in the consummated Spirit has been received by us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this, the Spirit has brought forth the church, which is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22b-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Body of Christ and the Spirit are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here the Body and the Spirit are joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit brought forth the church, but soon after that, the church became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the Spirit became the seven Spirits to meet the needs of the degraded church Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is what the entire book of Revelation shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is one, but He is also three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Father planned, the Son came to accomplish what the Father planned, and in the Son's accomplishment the life-giving Spirit was brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This Spirit, who is the transfigured Christ in resurrection, is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the degradation of the church, this consummated Spirit became the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is one yet three, and the three consummated in the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These three became the one consummated Spirit in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This consummated Spirit became the seven Spirits to meet the needs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is one yet three, the three are one in resurrection, and then one became seven, the seven Spirits, for the church's need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The seven Spirits are not seven separate Spirits; They denote the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The one Spirit has become the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>BEING IN THE SEVEN SPIRITS BY LIVING AND WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Where are we living today?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not live only in the one Spirit, nor do we live merely in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We live in the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the seven Spirits there are God, man, the death of Christ with its effectiveness, and the resurrection of Christ with its power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, the New Testament tells us that we should live and walk not only in the Spirit but also according to the spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit includes God, man, Christ's death with its effectiveness, and Christ's resurrection with its power.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When you follow this Spirit and walk according to this spirit, all the negative things in you are killed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, Romans 8:13 says that by the Spirit we should put to death the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We ourselves cannot die; we die by receiving the Spirit as the ointment for anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ointment applies the effectiveness of Christ's death to us to produce an effect in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today when we use medicated ointment, it kills the germs in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At the same time, there is the supply in the Spirit as the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, Philippians 1:19 says that this Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, has the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The negative aspect is the problem-solving by killing, and the positive aspect is the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Both aspects are in the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A CLOSING PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lord, we worship You that You are such a God; You are the consummated Spirit to be the God whom we worship.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You are not the same as the God in Judaism; You are also different from the God in Mohammedanism.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You are such a processed and consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You are one God, yet You are also three; in resurrection You are one in becoming the consummated Spirit; and for the need of the church You have become the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We truly worship You and thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In creation You are the Spirit of God; in God's relationship with man You are the Spirit of Jehovah; in God's incarnation You are the Holy Spirit; for the bringing forth of the church, You, as the Holy Spirit, became the life-giving, consummated Spirit; and for the needs of the church, You, as the life-giving Spirit, became the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today we are in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is our Lord, this is our God, this is our Redeemer, this is our Savior, and this is our Master, the One whom we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We truly desire to live in You as such a God, that is, to live in the Spirit, according to Your heart's desire.</S>
