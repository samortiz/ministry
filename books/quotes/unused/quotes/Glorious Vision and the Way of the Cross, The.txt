If any man says that he is serving the Lord yet has no feeling whatsoever, it proves that such a person has degraded
If we do not have any feeling concerning serving the Lord and being a testimony for Him, we are those without a vision
Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, and Noah were before Abraham; but the Bible does not mention how these five were called
Enosh knew God and served Him, and the Bible says that from that time on, man began to call on the name of Jehovah
It is not until we come to Abraham that a new thing is mentioned in the Old Testament, which is that God came to call Abraham
As far as we are concerned, it is a vision and a seeing-a very particular seeing, a seeing that we have never experienced before
Some of the idols Abraham was worshipping had faces of demons; others had faces of horses or were birds in a temple
After we have this glorious seeing, our entire being will be changed in its concept, attitude, conversation, and thought
The wonderful thing is that, on the positive side, the word of the Lord becomes tasteful, and God becomes attractive
Those who do not understand this may think that we have a mental problem, because our reaction is too different and too extraordinary!
At present, we very much encourage the brothers and sisters to prophesy in the district meetings on the Lord's Day
Later Peter told us in his Epistle that he was an eyewitness of the Lord's majesty on the mount of transfiguration
He did not know that to deny the soul in the Bible is not to deny the functions of the soul, that is, the mind, emotion, and will
Today, you young ones have put yourselves into the Lord's hands for the preaching of the gospel in the villages
In serving the Lord, not only are we unable to do anything apart from the Lord, but neither can we do anything apart from the members
In Philippians 2:2 Paul says, 'Make my joy full think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing'
The best way for two people to work together without any argument, opinion, or long face, is to crucify both on the cross
Even though 'number two' may be younger in age, he still wants to be somebody and is always aspiring to be the head
To put it simply, all of them have to do with the desire to be somebody, to take the lead, and to occupy a high position
Before the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He was leading a group of disciples, especially Peter, James, John, and Andrew
Today in the Lord's work in the church and among the gospel teams, one must remember that there are always problems ahead
Today in following the Lord and in working for Him the secret is nothing less than for you to put yourself on the cross and to remain there
The Chinese say, 'The strength of a horse is tested by the length of the journey, while the heart of man is tested by the passing of time'
When the real situation comes, there is not much of the cross with some of these brothers, and there is not much evidence of resurrection
If you would learn this lesson well and continue on the way of the cross, your work will be effective and full of blessing
For you to go to the villages for the outreach, wherever you may be, let there be only Christ, and no more you
The few of us co-workers who were close to Brother Nee always felt that he did not seem to have a single day of peace
What concerns us is the oppositions that have arisen from among the elders and co-workers in the Lord's recovery during the past sixty years
It is the humanity of those who are very seeking among us, who have forsaken the world and who love the Lord dearly
The Chinese use expressions such as 'brightness and uprightness' and 'supreme holiness and righteousness' to describe humanity
Although these philosophies are good, they are good only in the human sense; no outside power is added into them
After much studying, we have to agree with the same words that Paul spoke, 'For to will is present with me, but to do the good is not'
Nicodemus needed to be born anew, that is, he needed to be born of water and the Spirit before he could enter into the kingdom of God
When the Son of Man was crucified on the cross to bear and take away our sins, we were regenerated and received the eternal life
At the time man was created, he had only the image of God's attributes; he did not have the content and reality of these attributes
The humanity of one who serves the Lord must be: 1) a coming forth of God and 2) fully human, that is, it must have the proper human flavor
According to our understanding of the Bible and our personal experience, there are seven items of these excellent virtues
Towards God we have to be fully separated, and toward man, we have to be fully proper, with no fault whatsoever
In conclusion, the Christian humanity is a life lived out through the mingling of the divine attributes and the created human morality
The definitions vary according to different dictionaries and lexicons; there are different explanations of the word
In Philippians 1 Paul said, 'As always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death'
We both speak concerning humanity, but the elements of the two speakings are different and the natures are not the same
The Christian humanity does not refer to our natural virtues; rather, it is the Christ who lives in us and out of us
When we were saved, we had the Lord's mercy and grace to consecrate ourselves fully to the Lord and to love Him in a pure way
We have to see that it is only when the Lord returns and our bodies are redeemed that we can be totally free from the old creation
At breakfast time, when he loses his temper with his wife, he switches from the tree of life to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
He begins to regret the manner in which he spoke to his wife, and determines not to do the same thing next time
Alexander may have been saved and may have been a brother, but he did evil things to persecute the Lord's servant
If one day a brother or a sister offends you and wrongly accuses you, are you going to leave the Training Center?
We have to see that today we still have the corrupted nature of the old creation within us; we are not yet totally free from it
If there were no law courts, governments, or police stations on earth, we would not be able to live and work peacefully
If we do not love the Lord, we lose the restraint that comes from this kind of attraction and are liable to do anything and everything
Every one of the six virtuesthat which is true honorable righteous pure lovely and wellspoken of is hard to achieve from mans point of view
In this way, we live out godliness and the proper humanity, which is just Christ manifested in our bodies and lived out through us
Whether our humanity will be safeguarded or not depends on whether or not we continue to love the Lord and consecrate ourselves
For this reason, by grace you have to stand firm in Christ, maintaining this life through holding Christ as the humanity
Philippians 1:19 says, 'This shall turn out to salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ'
We are to be saved to the extent that 'Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death'
The salvation in Philippians is not just a matter of living out Christ, but a matter of magnifying Christ in our bodies
In His humanity, Christ passed through the experiences of incarnation and human living, eventually being crucified on the cross
As a result, Paul's magnifying of Christ brought even some in the household of Caesar to salvation through believing into Christ
It is by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that you can magnify Christ whether through life or through death
We know that in the Old Testament, the first step in the offering of a burnt offering is the killing of the sacrifice
There has to be the skinning, the cutting to pieces, and finally, the laying of the sacrifice on the altar to be burnt to ashes
In 2:13 Paul continued on to say, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
We are qualified to reflect the divine light of Christ and to hold forth and demonstrate to others the word of life
We have to realize that the way God ordains for Christians is the way of salvation which is also the way of expressing and magnifying Christ
It shows us that if we do not know the power of resurrection and do not live in resurrection, there is no way for us to die by ourselves
Rather, it is the Holy Spirit in you who is taking you on in the experience of the Lord's death, so that you can be conformed to His death
If we would not receive the cross, but would only exercise our spirit, this experience of the spirit would not be reliable
From Philippians 3:10 we see that the power of resurrection is the Spirit, and the conformation to the cross is death
We have to see that this kind of experience of Christ is totally different from the cultivation taught by the Chinese Confucianist
No matter how much the Confucianists improve themselves they have no resurrection power within which is the Spirit with the bountiful supply
