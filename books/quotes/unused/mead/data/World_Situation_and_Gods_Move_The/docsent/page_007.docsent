   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE WORLD SITUATION IN RELATION TO GOD'S MOVE ON EARTH 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 17:26-27; 1:8 THE PRESERVATION OF AMERICA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Around 1500 two important events occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One was the Reformation, which opened the gate of the prison of Catholicism and thus released the human mentality to search for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The other was the discovery of the Americas, two vast continents which until that time were virtually unknown and uninhabited.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God created the earth, the continent of North America was included not by chance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Under God's sovereignty it remained hidden for many centuries, preserved for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you study a world globe, you will readily see how vital this land mass is to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It lies between two oceans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Atlantic and Pacific are like two wings of an eagle, which is the symbol of America.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the early days of American independence the eagle was chosen as the emblem of the new nation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without its two wings, an eagle is powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The United States derives much of its strength from the two oceans on its shores.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The whole world today looks to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The American dollar is universally desired.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The dollar is one of the standards by which other currencies are measured.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is so, even though the United States is still a young country, less than three hundred years old.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Other nations, like Israel, look to America for financial aid.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another indication of the United States being the world's focus is the air traffic it has with other nations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To fly from the west coast to the Far East does not cost much more than to fly from Los Angeles to New York.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can the price be that little?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is because of the great abundance of traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many different airlines fly these routes daily.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God preserved America for fifty-five hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He allowed the fallen descendants of Adam to ruin all the other continents, but the Americas He kept undamaged.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Parking spaces are reserved for VIPs; we should consider that all Americans are VIPs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The land of America has been reserved for them!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all need a grateful attitude toward God for preserving America.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Though I am Chinese by birth, I do appreciate the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the top country in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has watched over it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE SPREAD OF THE EUROPEANS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With the release of the human mentality around the time of the Reformation, new, aggressive ideas came in. Europeans wanted to explore distant places.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was much competition among them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Spain took the lead to send out explorers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, many of the new territories came into her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Throughout South America, Central America, and the southwestern part of the United States the Spanish influence is still apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Spanish names like San Jose and Mission Viejo, with the letter j pronounced like an h, are examples of this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Spain's preeminence on the seas ended with the defeat of the Spanish Armada by the smaller British fleet in 1588.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This defeat restricted the further spread of Catholicism by Spain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE RISE OF CAPITALISM</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The new ideas of the sixteenth century led to modern science and the development of machines.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The wealthy could set up factories which turned out goods much more quickly than had been possible before.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The laborers worked hard for little pay.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In effect, the wealthy owners were robbing the poor working class and pocketing their money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These were the millionaire capitalists.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How was this problem of balancing the wealth to be solved?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The government favored the ever-expanding output of the factories because it meant more taxes, that is, increased revenue for the government.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, the factories got bigger and bigger, until eventually overproduction resulted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With goods not being sold, many of the factories then had to close down, causing unemployment and economic hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Where were markets to be found for these manufactured goods?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>IMPERIALISM</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The rich countries looked overseas for new markets.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They built up their navies and armies and went to the backward countries of Asia and Africa to subdue them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With a small number of men they would come into a country in their gunboats and force that country to sign a treaty promising to provide a market for their goods.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is imperialism.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For my college graduation in 1926 this is the topic I chose to write on for my thesis.</S>
