   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is true that the Triune God is one God, but there is the aspect of three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Son, He came to die to redeem us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, this does not mean that while the Son was dying, the Father and the Spirit were not there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament clearly indicates that when the Son was dying on the cross, the Father and the Spirit were both passing through death Acts 20:28; Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, redemption was accomplished by the Triune God, but it was accomplished by the Triune God in the Son; that is, it was the Son who accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through our repenting and believing, the Son's redemption is applied to us sinners for the forgiveness and purification of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, it is through the Son, that is, through the effectiveness of the Son's redemption, that we are qualified to come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be through the Son is to pass through the Son, to pass through the Son is to believe in the Son, and to believe in the Son is to receive the Son John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we receive the Son, we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we call on the Lord, passing through the Son, we are in the Spirit because the Son and the Spirit are one and because the Spirit is the reality of the Son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then, when we are in the Spirit, we have access unto the Father, because the Father is in the Son's name and the Father and the Son are one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the truth, these are three steps: we have access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our practical experience, however, these are three aspects of one experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once we believe in the Lord, we are in the Spirit and we have access unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The explanation given to us in the Bible is that we have access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father, but in our experience these things all happen simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we call on the Lord's name, we immediately have access in the Spirit unto the Father, because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, it is impossible for us to experience Christ without experiencing the Triune God, because whenever we call on the Lord's name, we are in the Spirit and we have access unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This may be compared to the flow of an electrical current that first comes out of the power plant, then passes through the wires, and is finally transmitted into our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In practicality, however, we simply turn on the switch and immediately use the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Ephesians 2:18 speaks of these three steps, it is telling us not that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three different persons but that they are one God in three aspects: the aspect of His redeeming us, the aspect of His applying redemption to us, and the aspect of His coming into us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to have access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through the Son is through the Triune God, in the Spirit is in the Triune God, and unto the Father is unto the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is how we enjoy all the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot experience Christ without experiencing the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is an enormous mistake to say that we experience Christ without experiencing the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is unfortunate that in today's Christianity this mistaken concept still exists due to two thousand years of the influence of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even among the saints in the Lord's recovery, there may still be some who unconsciously hold this mistaken concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must clearly and thoroughly see that to be in Christ is to be in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ cannot be separated from the Father or the Spirit because Colossians 2:9 clearly says that all the fullness of the Godhead, that is, all the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since the Bible reveals this, how can we experience Christ without experiencing the Father and the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Despite the clear revelation in God's Word and our bold preaching concerning this matter, the two thousand year-old influence of Christianity is still deeply implanted in people's hearts and is extremely difficult to get rid of.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, not only do some in Christianity think that I speak heresy, but even some of the saints in the Lord's recovery deny the truth of the Divine Trinity in their experience, although they confess it with their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of the influence of Christianity, many brothers and sisters only care for their subjective feeling while ignoring the revelation of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In their feeling they experience only one person, who naturally must be Christ, and since He is one person, they have neither the Father nor the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Little do they realize that this is a grave error.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some brothers and sisters make this kind of mistake for several reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, they are deeply influenced by the theology of traditional Christianity; second, they do not deeply research the truth; third, they do not check with their own experience; and fourth, they may purposely ignore the truth in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all need to come out of these errors.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to come out from under the influence of Christianity's erroneous, superficial theology.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, we need to earnestly study the Lord's Word and the truths in the Lord's recovery and carefully check them with our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way, we will have a proper, deep, subjective knowledge of the truth concerning the Divine Trinity.</S>
