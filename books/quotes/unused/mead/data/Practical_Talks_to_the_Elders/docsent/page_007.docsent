   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE PURENESS AND THE FOCUS THE CHINESE-SPEAKING MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I feel burdened to release some messages in the Chinese language that can be sent out to every part of the earth where Chinese saints meet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As to whether the Chinese-speaking saints in southern California come to these meetings, it is up to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I would like to say a word both to the churches and to the Chinese-speaking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As for the churches, surely something should be done, based upon the principle of shepherding, for the Chinese-speaking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether your church agrees for them to participate in these meetings where the message will be given in Chinese, you must still consider how to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The number of Chinese immigrants to this country is steadily increasing, every year by at least forty thousand, with most of them settling in southern California.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a great need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This meeting could be of help to all the churches taking care of this need.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The churches need to consider what to do about this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As for the Chinese-speaking saints, if your English is sufficient, you are not qualified to come to the Chinese-speaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you can understand the messages and testimonies in English and can express yourself in English in prayer, there is no need for you to come to the Chinese-speaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If, however, in spite of being able to manage well in English, you have a burden to care for some younger ones, or newer ones, or some of your relatives, you may still come to the Chinese-speaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not talking about a Chinese meeting, only a Chinese-speaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not based upon race, but upon the management of language.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This meeting is set up only for those who cannot manage the English in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we had another reason, it would be wrong to set up such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It would be a division.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just because of the language problem, we need for a time to have a bridge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, if you do not have this language difficulty, even if you are Chinese, you are not qualified to attend; that is, unless you have a burden for some Chinese-speaking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Trouble</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter what we do, there is always some trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Don t say, Brother Lee, this practice will increase the trouble in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is true, but if you do not want to have trouble, it is better to die and be buried!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as you live, you will have trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you want to eat, there is the trouble of getting the groceries, then of cooking them, then of setting the table, and then of cleaning up afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even sleeping is a trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to overcome the trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Probably nothing is as troublesome as the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I were not a Christian called and burdened by the Lord, I would not touch this matter; I would rather do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just one meeting in one language is trouble enough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now to have two meetings with two languages will not only double but even triple the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For one thing, the leadership has to be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One set of meetings will be in Chinese, needing some to take care of it; another will be in English, also needing some to take care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Be assured that your burden will be much heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then there will be the need for coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With only one kind of meeting, you might not realize how important the coordination is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Two kinds of meetings will put you on the spot, testing how elastic is your ability to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am afraid your elasticity will not stretch very far; after two weeks it will break!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a warning, not a prediction; I hope it will not turn out to have been a prediction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Coordination is most necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Overcoming the Problem of Race</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even in the first century the apostles met this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Paul s Epistles at least twice he says there can be neither Greek nor Jew Gal 3:28; Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose the Jews had not gone into dispersion; they all lived in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Corinth, in Macedonia, in Ephesus and the other cities of Asia Minor, there would have been no Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How much simpler it would have been!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why did Columbus discover America and open the way for so many people to come in?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Last week at our Chinese conference we had about eleven hundred, all of the yellow race.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who would have thought that in America there could be over one thousand of them, all Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>And more are coming.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means there will be more trouble!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The apostles had this trouble in their time; that s why Paul had to write no Greek, no Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This must be practically applied to us: no white, no yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>More than a hundred years ago there was a war in this country between the north and the south over the matter of race.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I read that during the battles the soldiers on both sides prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They prayed to the same God and Savior Jesus, and sometimes they called each other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I would like to tell you that this fighting has never ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Still today in Christianity this shame is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To overcome this matter of race is probably possible only in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And it is only a possibility.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Just before the Chinese conference, I spoke to the serving ones at the Living Stream on the subject, Grace Swallowing Up Race.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you know what the church life is?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is the grace that swallows up race.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Race is short of a letter, G. If we add G to our race, there will be no more race, only grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If there is still race, it indicates we are short of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In my whole Christian life I have never performed a wedding, but now I will marry the two meetings with the two languages.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This ceremony will not last just an hour; it may take several years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To have two meetings in two languages in one locality means trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have seen and experienced and suffered much regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But we have no choice.</S>
