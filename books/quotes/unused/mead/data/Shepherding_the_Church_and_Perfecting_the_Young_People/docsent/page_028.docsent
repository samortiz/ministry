   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LETTING THE YOUNG PEOPLE SERVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND SUPPLYING THEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In every school we must produce young saints who are so burdened for the gospel that the work becomes theirs, and we only assist and supply them from a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps a co-worker serves with a group of at least ten young saints who do not know how to meet when they come together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The co-worker should instruct the young saints how to meet and if necessary should also supply them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the supply should not be in the way of leading the students in a meeting or replacing them in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The co-worker should not decide on what day the students meet, direct them to invite their friends, take the lead in their meeting, or give a message in their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he functions in this way, he is replacing the students.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though he will spend much time and energy, none of the young saints will be able to serve; instead, they will support the co-worker with their presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the Lord s mercy, this kind of work may still bear some fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord s grace is abundant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wherever the Lord s word is, there will always be a certain amount of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we preach the gospel and speak the Lord s word, the Holy Spirit will always work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, that is not the best foundation for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our work is to produce a saint who is more burdened than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should work with him until he is on fire for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He should be so burdened for the gospel that even if the director of his school opposes Christ, he would find a way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our work is a success if we do not go to a school and ask the director for a room in order for the young saints to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what it means to be a capable worker.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should let the brother whom we have perfected lead his classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he asks for help, we should be ready to assist him so that he can take a step forward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we work in this way, the young saints will decide when and where to have a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They will take care of their own meeting and bear the burden for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apparently, their meeting is their work; in reality, it is also our work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this is the way we serve, every school will be open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both university students and junior high school students can be gained in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of replacing the students, we should serve with them and let them serve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a problem for them to make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should watch over them from a distance and render help to them when necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TRAINING THE STUDENTS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the co-workers grasp this principle and practice it diligently, they will succeed and the work will be light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many of those who serve in the young people s work expend much energy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are like generals who fight the battle on their own instead of letting the soldiers fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A good and skilled general never fights the battle himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The soldiers fight the battle, and the general directs the troops.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not labor in this way, we may gain results, but the effect will be minimal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more students we can train to fight the battle, the greater will be the results.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should regard the students as soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we learn this secret, our service will be ten times more effective.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To engage in battle does not require a great skill, but to teach others to fight requires skill.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to teach others, you must be the first one to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more people you teach, the more you must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we could adopt this way of serving, it will be easy to spread the work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are probably three hundred and twenty thousand students in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we gain one-tenth of them, we will have thirty-two thousand students.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is not asking too much from us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He asks only for one-tenth, but this one-tenth is thirty-two thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we continue in the old way, we will not be able to gain this many.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The co-workers must also learn to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They must endeavor in this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The military emphasizes training, supply, and then command.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Unless a person has been trained, he cannot command troops in a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must learn the scientific way of serving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The scientific way is contrary to our natural inclination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must learn many things in order to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Any co-worker who adopts this method in his service will gain results within two years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although we do not have many co-workers, I would still encourage all the co-workers to put as much of their time as possible into working with the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This does not mean that they should not care for other services in the church, nor does it mean that they should not assist the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This simply means that eighty percent of their time should be spent with the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the co-workers should not do the work themselves; they should carry out the work according to this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then there will be a work in the universities, a work in the junior high schools, a work in the high schools, and a work in the vocational schools.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we practice according to this way, the work will continually grow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must let the students have their own meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must even let go of the junior high students and let them have their own meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At the same time, we should actively supply, care for, and guide them from a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The university students may not require as much of our effort and time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The younger the students, the more time and effort we will need.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This does not mean that we should lead their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No, we should still let them have their own meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Guiding the students can be compared to flying a kite.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A person holds the string that is attached to the kite, not the kite itself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The students carry out the work, and we supply them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The way we serve and the supply we render are the focal points of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These two matters are not easy to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No matter what the situation is, we must always have something solid with which to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This supply cannot be met by giving one message a week.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What we supply should meet the students real need.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Initially, this may be difficult, but the more skilled we are, the easier it will become.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Furthermore, it is very effective.</S>
