   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COMING BACK TO THE LORD'S WORD TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a rare opportunity for all of us to be able to gather here this time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I feel deeply that the best thing to do is to come back to the Lord's word together, to enjoy the Lord and His presence, and to have some prayers in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that this is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason, during these four days we have arranged to have one hour during the first session every morning to enjoy half a chapter from the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We will have another half a chapter for pray-reading in the second session.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This will serve as the foundation for our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the afternoon, I would ask you to take my advice and come together from three-thirty to six o'clock to read some messages.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are altogether eight messages, two from the California elders' meetings of March this year, two from the elders' and co-workers' meetings of the church in Taipei recently, and four from last week's conference with the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every afternoon we will read two messages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the four evenings, we will have four messages that cover specifically the mysteries in God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first message will be on the mystery of God being Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second message will be on the mystery of Christ being the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third message will be on the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fourth message will be on the mysterious law of the Spirit of life in God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This time we want to consider these matters in a most profound, transcendent, and conclusive way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope that this will serve as an initiation to draw out more treasures and will bring in something precious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe that the Lord is rich among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I want the brothers and sisters to know that during the past five or six years, while I was studying the new way of the Lord, I have never deviated from the basic structure of the messages of my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the time I have been on life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let me repeat that it is a rare opportunity for us to come together this time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that the brothers would pray and would be prepared to receive revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will uplift us and will uplift and carry on the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A word given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 18, 1990</S>
