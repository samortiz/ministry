 <h2 class="head1">THE VEIL BEING TAKEN AWAY<br />
WHENEVER THE HEART TURNS TO THE LORD</h2>
<p><em>Question: In Acts 9, when the apostle Paul met the Lord on the way to Damascus, did the Lord appear to him inwardly or outwardly? Then in 2 Corinthians 3:16, Paul says that whenever the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. In order to have the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, must we first remove our veil, or must the Lord work in us first?</em></p>
<p>Answer: If we were to ask Paul whether he saw Christ when he saw the great light on the way to Damascus, or whether he saw Christ later when he wrote 2 Corinthians 3, he would definitely say that he does not know. He only knows that he met the Lord on the day when he was on the way to Damascus. After he met the Lord, what was formerly clear to him became blurred. Formerly his eyes were bright, but now he was blind. If we were to ask Paul where God revealed His Son in him, he would say that it was in Damascus at the time Ananias laid his hands on him. Paul could say that although it was Ananias who laid his hands on him, from that point on, it was God who revealed His Son in him. This is good enough. We really do not need to study whether the scales fell from his eyes first or whether the Spirit of Christ entered into him first, because Paul himself was not quite clear. If we engage ourselves too much in this kind of study, we will easily be blinded. This is an insignificant thought, which greatly frustrates us from seeing light. The story of Paul on the road to Damascus simply shows that we need to be met by the Lord before we can meet Him inwardly.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; This shows clearly that if our heart does not turn to the Lord, a veil is there. The veil is taken away not by God&rsquo;s removing it but by our turning our heart to the Lord. Actually, our turned-away heart is a veil. What is a veil? A veil is something that hinders us from seeing. If I am face to face with you, and there is a veil between us, I cannot see you. But if the veil is taken away, I can see you. If I turn my back toward you, I cannot see you; this is to be veiled. But if I turn toward you, I can see you, and there is no veil between us.</p>
<p>Similarly, as soon as we turn around and look at the Lord, we will see the Lord. Not facing toward the Lord is the veil, but once we turn toward the Lord, the veil is gone. Whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. The children of Israel began to have the veil from Mount Sinai. The veil that Paul spoke of in 2 Corinthians 3 does not refer to an outward, visible veil but to an inward veil which obstructs man from seeing God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>With the children of Israel, the veil came in at Mount Sinai. The veil came in because the children of Israel began to rely on themselves when they were at Mount Sinai. God said, &ldquo;I bore you on eagles&rsquo; wings and brought you to Myself. Now therefore if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My personal treasure from among all peoples, for all the earth is Mine&rdquo; (Exo. 19:4-5). Then all the people answered together and said, &ldquo;All that Jehovah has spoken we will do&rdquo; (v. 8). From that time on, a veil came upon the children of Israel and remains on them until now (2 Cor. 3:15).</p>
<p>Then in verse 16 Paul says, &ldquo;But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; The principle is the same today. In Matthew the Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God&rdquo; (5:8). To be pure means that we want only God, and we do not want anyone or anything besides God. God is light (1 John 1:5). If our heart is facing toward the Lord, we will have light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
FOR REACHING HIS ETERNAL GOAL</h2>
<p>We must see that with the Lord Jesus, He first bore the cross and then was crucified; but with us, we first are crucified and then bear the cross. The Lord&rsquo;s living on the earth began with bearing the cross and ended with crucifixion. Our living&#151;the Christian living&#151;should begin with crucifixion and continue with bearing the cross. In other words, our Lord took the cross and bore it the moment He was born on earth, and He continued bearing the cross for thirty-three and a half years. He never lived a life apart from the cross. However, we should not understand the cross merely as a suffering; at the same time, we should not consider that the Lord was ever free from suffering during His thirty-three and a half years on earth. The significance of the cross is death and termination. Throughout the thirty-three and a half years of the Lord&rsquo;s living on earth, He was never freed from death. He served God by standing in death day by day. He stood in death and lived in death. In those thirty-three and a half years, He always bore in His body the brands of death. He was in death, He lived in death, and He did the work of God in death.</p>
<p>In the end He was crucified, and before the entire universe He thus displayed the death He had borne for thirty-three and a half years and accomplished the fact of His death. From the day the cross was displayed, His all-inclusive death has become a glorious fact in the universe. This fact includes you and me and all the created things.</p>
<p>There is one goal in God&rsquo;s plan, and this goal is Christ. The cross is God&rsquo;s procedure for attaining the goal. His death on the cross is a great &ldquo;surgery,&rdquo; because the entire universe was crucified and dealt with by Him. Everything has been dealt with on the cross, whether it be the angels, Satan, or man. That was a great &ldquo;surgery.&rdquo; The unique and greatest surgery in the universe is the cross through which God reaches His goal. The cross is the procedure that God needs for His eternal plan.</p>
<p>In order to carry out this procedure, one day Christ became flesh; He came to be a man, joining Himself with His creatures. The process of His death was not completed when He was born into humanity; it merely became a possibility for Him. Hence, He Himself first lived in that &ldquo;surgery&rdquo;&#151;death. Even though His physical death was not yet accomplished, He was already living in it for thirty-three and a half years. At the end, He carried out the actual procedure of death on the cross at Golgotha. What He did on the cross that one time fully accomplished the procedure foreordained in God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<p>Our Lord can be compared to the best cook who, after preparing a meal, makes it available for us to enjoy. On that day the Lord Jesus accomplished death for us on the cross and made it available for us to receive. If He had not died on the cross, He could not have made His death available for us to enjoy, even though He lived His life in death. For thirty-three and a half years, only He was in death. Peter could not enter into His death, neither could John nor James; no one could enter into His death. It was not until the day His death was accomplished on the cross that His divinity, humanity, human living, and all-terminating death could become our enjoyment through His resurrection life.</p>
