   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>She Being Terrible</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>as an Army with Banners</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The lover of Christ is also terrible as an army with banners lifted up as a sign of victory v. 4b</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lover s Becoming the Heavenly Sanctuary and the Heavenly Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Being Due to Her Victory over the Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This praise of her Beloved indicates that her becoming the heavenly sanctuary and the heavenly Jerusalem is due to her victory over the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only by being an overcomer, one who overcomes the enemies, can we live within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An Indication of Her Maturity</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>in Life for God s Building</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Previously the lover was likened to a mare, a horse among Pharaoh s chariots, a rose in Sharon, a lily in the valleys and among thorns, a dove, a pillar of smoke, a bed, a palanquin, a garden, and a fountain with a spring, but now she is likened to the heavenly dwelling of God and the heavenly Jerusalem, indicating her maturity in life for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the building of the Body of Christ, we need the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 4:12-16, which speaks of the building up of the Body, tells us that we need growth to reach maturity so that the Body of Christ can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To build up the church in a general way requires only the capacity to manage, arrange, and take care of things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not something organic but something organized according to human management.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the building up of the Body has nothing to do with our ability to organize, manage, and arrange things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Body of Christ is an organism, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The building up of this organism depends on growth and the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The building of the Body is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To build up the Body organically, we need to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the reason that we are now stressing the building up of the Body much more than the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Timothy is a book on the church as the house of God 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is nothing in this book on the building of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Timothy 3 speaks of the arrangement of elders and deacons in their service, but Ephesians does not speak of elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, it speaks of members growing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, we need to grow, and then we can perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This perfecting is according to 2 Corinthians 13, in which Christ is living and growing in us v. 5 and we are enjoying the Triune God in the Father s love, the Son s grace, and the Spirit s fellowship v. 14 . This is the building up of the Body, not the building up of the church as a kind of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This building, for which we need the maturity in life, is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the organic Body of Christ, which will consummate the organic New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord s Word of Seeming Rejection</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Turn your eyes away from me, / For they overcome me S. S. 6:5a . This is the Lord s word of seeming rejection cf.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mark 7:25-27; John 11:5-7; Exo 32:10; Gen 32:26 , but actually it is the word inviting her expression of her overcoming love to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a rejection is actually a kind of welcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord says, Turn your eyes away from Me, He is really saying that we should put our eyes on Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we love someone, we want that person to look at us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Beloved s words are words that invite the lover s expression of her overcoming love to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Her Hair Being Like a Flock of Goats</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead S. S. 6:5b . The meaning here is the same as that in 4:1b.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Her Teeth Being Like a Flock of Ewes</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your teeth are like a flock of ewes / That have come up from the washing, / All of which have borne twins, / And none of them is bereaved of her young 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The meaning here is the same as that in 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Her Cheeks Being Like a Piece of Pomegranate</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The meaning here is the same as that in 4:3b.</S>
