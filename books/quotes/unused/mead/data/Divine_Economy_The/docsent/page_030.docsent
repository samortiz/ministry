   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN CHRIST BECOMING THE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 7:38-39; 14:16-20, 26; 15:26; 16:7, 13-15; 20:22; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Acts 16:6-7; Rom 8:9-10; Phil 1:19; 2 Tim 4:22; Rev 1:4; 5:6; 2:7; 22:17a THE TWO MAJOR STEPS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament reveals to us that Christ took two major steps.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first step was His incarnation, and the second step was His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among the Christians in the past centuries, much attention has been paid to Christ's incarnation, but the resurrection of Christ has been much neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus, who was God, the Creator of the universe, took a major step to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament tells us that God as the Word became flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that God joined Himself to fallen humanity, yet He was without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God took a major step to become a man, and this man was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was not a common man but a God-man, who lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and passed through human living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the end of His human life He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death to take away all the negative things in the universe, thus clearing up the way for Him to dispense Himself into God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through His death the divine life within this God-man was released.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That released divine life produced many believers, produced the church, which is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through death He took the second step of resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the resurrected God-man, He became the Spirit that gives life 2 Cor 3:6, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to pay our full attention to two crucial verses in the New Testament: John 1:14 says, "The Word became flesh," and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Bible teachers have told people that the Word became flesh, but not many have taught that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In these two verses the same predicate is used became.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be impressed with the clear and accurate word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus as God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He became a man, and this man was the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This last Adam, who was Jesus in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before His incarnation, the Lord Jesus was purely, merely, singly, wholly, and completely God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was the complete God, the entire God, the whole God, but He was not a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not have the human nature, the human element, or the human essence before His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Essentially, He only had the divine element and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day about two thousand years ago He took a wonderful step God was born out of a virgin in a manger to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This little child in the manger was the mighty God Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was not merely God, but a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the greatest wonder in the universe!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This God-man's name is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever you say the name Jesus, you have to recall that Jesus was God becoming a man and that He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He lived in Nazareth, a small town despised by people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He lived in a poor family and in a lowly carpenter's home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is marvelous that the Creator of the universe, of the heavens and of the earth, lived in a poor carpenter's home, not as a guest but as a son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He lived there as a carpenter Mark 6:3 , so God in the form of a man did carpentry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Outwardly He had the appearance of a man, but inwardly He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The unlimited God, the infinite God, was limited and restricted in a little home to be a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What patience!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What suffering!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What limitation!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What restriction!</S>
