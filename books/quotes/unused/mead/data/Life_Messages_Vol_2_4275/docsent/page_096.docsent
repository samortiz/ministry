   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS FOR TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Is the age today not dark?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is it not degraded?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What we need is the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ today is not only the Spirit, but the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ, walking among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Christ in you has seven eyes!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is watching and shining in you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However troublesome the doctrine sounds, in your experience you are surely aware of His eyes upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more you love the Lord, the more you sense His searching of you and the clearer the vision is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From whatever angle you try to avoid His searching gaze, those seven eyes do not miss anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A light word, some impulsive greediness, or some covetousness all bring the seven eyes to focus on you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wherever you go you cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>CHRIST DISPENSED INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Christ God has dispensed into us is salvation and life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is not a doctrine or a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the living, life-giving One with seven eyes, watching and penetrating our being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The result is that we become transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that Christ has been worked into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To God Christ is His mystery; to us Christ is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's dispensing is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether we are praying at home, attending morning watch, pray-reading, or fellowshipping with each other, God is dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even when we deal with our sins, repenting and confessing, God is dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christ He dispenses is not just the Spirit, but the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord that we are in His economy!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ, the mystery of God and the economy of God, is being dispensed into us.</S>
