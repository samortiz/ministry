   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STRIPPING OFF PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By His all-accomplishing death, the Lord Jesus has stripped off principalities and powers Col 2:15, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. The powers of darkness are related to our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may even say that they are wrapped up with our flesh and self.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the self there is Satan and the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not argue that the powers of darkness are in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes, these powers are in the air, but they are also related to our self and our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He nailed the flesh and the self on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By doing that, He also stripped off the principalities and powers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose I am wearing a white shirt and that on this shirt are some spots of dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The best way to remove the dirt is to strip off the shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the shirt is removed, the dirt is removed also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our flesh and self are like the white shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God created this white shirt, but Satan has caused spots of dirt, the principalities and powers, to appear on it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The best way to eliminate these spots is to strip off the shirt, that is, to deal with the flesh and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us once again use married life as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brothers have often come to me with difficulties they are having with their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have said to them, "The only way to deal with the problem is for you to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not deal with your troublesome wife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Deal with the self that is bothered by her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She has a bothering self, and you have a bothered self.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of dealing with your wife's bothering self, deal with your bothered self.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you are buried in the tomb, you will not be troubled by your wife any more.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason you are troubled by her is that your self is still so active.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your self wants to have a wonderful wife who has been dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I will not take sides with you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I take sides with your wife in killing you so your self might be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother, if you are willing to be buried, there will be no problems."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason that Satan and the principalities and powers trouble you is that you are still wearing the "dirty shirt."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you strip off the "shirt" and leave it in the tomb, the evil powers will also be stripped off.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is in this way that Christ, by His death on the cross has stripped off all the principalities and powers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He went to the cross in His flesh, all the principalities and powers followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord seemed to say, "Principalities and powers, follow Me. I am going to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By My death on the cross, I shall strip you off."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the meaning of Colossians 2:14 and 15.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CRUCIFYING THE OLD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By His death, Christ has also crucified our old man Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ died not only for our sins, but also because of our self, which is our old man, our sinful old man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sins are the expression of our old man, whereas our old man is the source of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This old man has been crucified on the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CRUCIFYING THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He was crucified on the cross, Christ also crucified our flesh with its passions and lusts Gal 5:24, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>. The death of Christ has accomplished so many positive and negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything negative has been dealt with by the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the all-inclusive death, the all-accomplishing death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we are conformed to such a death and are willing to undergo such a baptism, all the positive aspects of Christ's death will be realized, and all the negative things will be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are willing to live under this death, there will be no problems.</S>
