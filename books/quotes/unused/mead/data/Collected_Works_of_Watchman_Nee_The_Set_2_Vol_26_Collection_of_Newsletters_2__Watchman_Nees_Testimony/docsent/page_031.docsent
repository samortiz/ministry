   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To the Lord's faithful servant, Mr. Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although your name is misunderstood among the public, may the Father God greatly bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am not writing this letter to apologize to you, nor am I trying to comfort you, but I want to testify concerning the Lord who loves sinners with His marvelous salvation, glorious freedom, and inscrutable guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When my two younger brothers began pursuing and desiring the Lord, they were cheated by the miserable gospel of relying on works, keeping commandments, and hoping they might be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their experience hindered me from knowing God; I had difficulties with the true gospel and could not be born easily into the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ears to hear the truth, eyes to know God, and a mouth to drink spiritual milk are all part of the uncreated, spiritual life which God gives, just like our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This life is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must first receive the promise by faith that it would be produced this is regeneration!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a person does not know whether he is saved, this proves he has not been born into God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can he receive the Father's inheritance, let alone represent Christ while living on the earth, fight with the powers of darkness, shut the mouth of the enemy and those who would take revenge, fulfill God's will, or satisfy God's heart's desire?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is more difficult to preach the gospel to people in denominations than to any other kind of person because you must first tear down before you can build up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I used to be a member of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank the Lord for His enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was baptized into His name in June of this year and have partaken of the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have also seen that the denominations are the fruit of the flesh, are sectarian, and cannot be counted as the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, there is no way to correct them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has already rejected them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are filled with incurable darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can only "come out from their midst" 2 Cor 6:17 !</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, I left the yoke of the denominations in July.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I remember that I did not want to leave at the time because of human affection, but God always gains the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He used strong words to lay hold of me so that I could not get through, including Luke 16:10, 12:47, and James 4:17.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For three weeks I could not finish writing my letter of resignation, but I finally obeyed and sent it by registered mail.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before I came to Shanghai someone told me, "You can go to hear preaching anywhere in Shanghai, but you must stay away from Mr. Watchman Nee and his group because they make a business of stealing sheep with their knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must be careful lest you stumble."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was so foolish that I did not know who you were then, but this was a strong introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oh, we cannot be separated from the love of God!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After coming to Shanghai, I asked whomever I saw whether they were related to Mr. Nee or knew him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What inscrutable leading!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day I accidentally met a sister who had left the denominations and was walking in the same way as you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At first I was afraid of her because of the bondage of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now I often remember her as my Martha and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She was the first person to pray for me before the Lord, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord sent His servant to me so that I would understand that salvation is by grace, not by works, that it is a present matter, according to Acts 26:17-18, which says, "I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If Moses had not been misunderstood by the Israelites, he could never have brought God's chosen people out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If your name had not been misunderstood, I could never have been led to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should thank the Lord that He has fed us bread until we are full!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the Lord bless this loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the brothers and sisters in the Lord thank God unceasingly whenever they hear of or encounter a situation in which an individual or a church is misunderstood or persecuted, because the Lord is again using His marvelous salvation, glorious release, and inscrutable leading to call His children out of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord is Victor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His will will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Him is the yes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All things work together for good to those who love the Lord, just as the persecution of the saints in Soochow and Hangchow turned into a victorious miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am only a newborn babe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am weak and powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope that you will instruct me with Christ's love, so that I do not shame the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"It is more blessed to give than to receive."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Respectfully from your little brother,</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yu Hsiung Fei</S>
