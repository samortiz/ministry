   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Christ as the Center</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is also the center of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is portrayed by the way the children of Israel were encamped around the tabernacle with three tribes on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The four camps, each composed of three tribes, and the three families of the tribe of Levi all took the tabernacle with the ark as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel thus took Christ as the meaning of life, the testimony, and the center.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows us that as the church today we should take Christ as our meaning of life, our testimony, and our center.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. Christ as the Leader, the Way, and the Goal</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The book of Numbers reveals that this Christ, who is the meaning of our life, our testimony, and our center, is One who is moving, acting, and always proceeding onward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His proceeding onward, He is our Leader Matt 23:10 , our way John 14:6 , and our goal Phil 3:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To take the lead is to proceed on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we are taking Christ as our Leader, and we are following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is leading us on His way and toward His goal, both of which are actually Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Worldly people have neither a way nor a goal, but we have Christ not only as our Leader but also as our way and our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament there is a revelation of Christ in all these aspects, but it is not given there in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we had only the New Testament and not the Old Testament with all its types, we could not see Christ in such a detailed and fine portrait.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For a complete view of Christ as the meaning of life, the testimony, the center, and the Leader, the way, and the goal, we need the portrait in the book of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the journey of God's redeemed people and for their fighting, Christ is the meaning of life, the testimony, the center, and the Leader, the way, and the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If Christ were not all this to us, there would not be a way for God to gain the ground on earth to build up His kingdom with His house, which eventually will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Jerusalem will be the consummation of God's kingdom and God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The entire Bible shows us one thing that God's intention is to have a people formed into an army to take Christ as their meaning of life, testimony, center, Leader, way, and goal and to proceed on and fight for God that He may gain the ground on earth and have a people built up as His kingdom and His house, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
