   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOT'S END</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 19:1 says that Lot sat at the gate of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At that time the custom of all the countries in the east was not like today's court.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These countries judged the civil affairs at the gate of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their judges were those who were elected among the qualified ones in the city, and they served as the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As judges they sat at the gate of the city to judge the civil affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lot sat at the gate of the city; he was promoted.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was not only a commoner of Sodom; he became a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lot's position in the world had become higher and more advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way to sin is like this; it only goes faster.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At first Lot was only near Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later on, he dwelt in Sodom, and finally he became a judge in Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What was the result of Lot's doing such things?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His wife died halfway, his daughters committed fornication, and his sons-in-law were burnt by the fire from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The book of 2 Peter says that Lot was a righteous man 2:7 , but he forgot that he had taken residence in Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He even shed tears for those who were evil, but he forgot to shed tears for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person can shed tears for other Christians, but forget to shed tears for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lot saw the great sins in the people of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He even wanted to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But he did not realize that he could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many Christians are the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They have become backslidden, yet they still urge others to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God wanted to destroy Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But He listened to Abraham's prayer, and two angels went to rescue Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genesis 19:12-14 says, "And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons-in-law."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lot had no testimony in front of his sons-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They thought that he mocked them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>People may believe if you say that the street is on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But no one will believe if you say that there will be fire coming from the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>People may still believe if you say that the fire of the gas tank will burn a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But no one will believe if you say that brimstone will burn a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Genesis 19:16 says, "And while he lingered..."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These words show a vivid portrait.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems that Lot wanted to speak to his cows and sheep: "O cows, for you I separated myself from Abraham; for you I chose the plain of Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>O sheep, you have been in my place for five years, can I desert you today?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It seems that he looked at his furniture, his treasures, his sheepfold, and his warehouse, and thought, "I thought that I could live in Sodom forever.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I wanted to build a larger warehouse to store all my goods and belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And then I would speak to my soul and say, Soul, eat, drink, and be merry.'</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Am I going to leave all these behind?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Am I going to walk away like this today?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I cannot suffer losing so many wonderful things!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Genesis 19:16-17 says, "The men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These were the instructions to them after the angels led them out of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today you are in the world, and you may not have much money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But you may be as reluctant to part company with the world as Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There was an old lady who only had fifteen dollars, and she counted them every day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may laugh at her for her obsession with money.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But when a person with a box full of property deeds inspects them and treasures them, God in the heavens laughs at him in the same way that we laugh at the old lady.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In our eyes fifteen dollars means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But in God's eyes, a box full of title deeds also means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus is coming soon.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The destruction of Sodom is a type of the coming destruction of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If all your hopes, whether great or small, are built on this world, one day the fire from heaven will consume them all.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One day God will destroy them all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When that day comes, you will not be able to escape even if you want to.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There will be no way for you to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whatever you cannot let go of today will be let go in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the time of the rapture, God will only rapture men; He will not rapture any objects.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God will only save men; He will not put out fire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, today we should gladly let things go.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Genesis 19:26 says, "But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Lot's wife followed her husband's desire; she looked back.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even though there was nothing more to see, a glance back at the burning fire would still make her feel better.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What she wanted to see indicated what her heart would not let go of.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This looking back tells us many things and expresses many inward feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This look turned her into a pillar of salt, and she became a serious warning to us even until today!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord said, "But on the day in which Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It will be in the same way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed...Remember Lot's wife" Luke 17:29-30, 32 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the coming of the Lord, this world will also be judged, and everything on the earth will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The ones who love the world will be left on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They will be like Lot's wife, who remained on earth to become a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Friends, I am afraid that we have paid too much attention to vain things and have forgotten about the eternal things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are very busy with social activities, with our children's education, and with our businesses.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is right to educate our children and take care of our business.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But the eternal things need our attention too.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Friends, particularly young friends, your way may still be long.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the Lord still delays, let us choose today the way which we should take.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Let us pay attention today to what is valuable, what is coming from God, and what will last to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Let us hope that our glory is not today, that we will learn to draw near to God, and that we will go on properly in the way ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>AN ANNOUNCEMENT</S>
