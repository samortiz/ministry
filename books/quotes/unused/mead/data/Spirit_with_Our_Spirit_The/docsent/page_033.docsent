   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When I began to minister in the United States in 1962, a number of people told me that they had never before heard that man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many teachers and preachers do not know or believe the truth concerning the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1954 I was invited to hold a conference and training in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A certain Brethren missionary came to Hong Kong to attend my conference.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the conference he told me that he appreciated what he heard in the meetings but that he could not agree with the teaching about the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said that the spirit and the soul are synonyms, referring to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I asked him about 1 Thessalonians 5:23, where Paul refers to our "spirit and soul and body."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul used the conjunction and twice in this phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows that man's spirit and soul are two distinct items.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, Hebrews 4:12 says that the living word of God can divide our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After I pointed this out to him, he still said that he could not believe that we have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many dear saints today are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some do not care about the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They feel that this is too abstract to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is no wonder that they cannot be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, you can never be spiritual if you do not know you have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 4:24 says that God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that God's substance is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This verse goes on to say that those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The divine Spirit and the human spirit are both mentioned in John 4:24.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Gospel of John has another verse which refers to the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this verse the first Spirit is the begetting Spirit; the second spirit is the begotten spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The pronoun our is used in this verse, referring to our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is Spirit, but if we had no spirit, we could not join to Him as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is mentioned emphatically in 1 Corinthians 6:17: "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These are the strong verses in the New Testament which convey the revelation to us concerning both God the Spirit and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If God were not a Spirit, how could He be our life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we did not have a spirit, how could God be contacted, touched, received, and contained by us?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our spirit is the organ with which we can contact God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must use the proper organ to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to see, we must use our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot appreciate colors if we do not use our eyes, the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>People say there is no God, because they are unaware that they have a particular organ within them with which to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They deny this organ and do not use it, so they cannot know God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is a Spirit, and He made a spirit within us so that we can contact Him.</S>
