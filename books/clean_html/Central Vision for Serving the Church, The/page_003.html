<h2 class="head1">SATAN USING BOTH GOOD AND EVIL<br />
TO DAMAGE GOD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>In the same principle, our service to God can be used as an instrument of Satan to destroy God&rsquo;s move. We are not indifferent Christians who do not love or serve God; we all love and serve God zealously. However, we must bring our love for God, our service to God, and our being for the church to the Lord to see whether or not we are fulfilling His heart&rsquo;s desire or opposing it. We should never judge according to good or evil, thinking that good things are good and that only evil things are evil. When Satan is involved, there is no difference between good and evil because he mixes good and evil together, and he brings this mixture of good and evil into the service to God. We should not think that Satan cannot use us because we do not lose our temper or play mah-jongg or because we have given our life to the church and bear some responsibility. Satan is still walking about (1 Pet. 5:8); he has not yet been bound. According to the revelation of the Bible, Satan can still come into God&rsquo;s presence in the third heaven to accuse God&rsquo;s people (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-6). He will not be cast down from heaven to the earth until Revelation 12, and he is temporarily bound and cast into the abyss only in chapter 20. Only when he has been bound will Satan be unable to use our love for the Lord to damage God&rsquo;s move. Since Satan is still working today, we should not believe that he cannot use something that is good.</p>
<p>If some among us esteem ourselves highly, we should not be so confident. A good number of saints may say that they love the Lord so much and have been faithful to the Lord for so long that they would never deviate or fall into Satan&rsquo;s hand. Please do not say this! The more certainty we have concerning our condition, the more likely we are to fall into Satan&rsquo;s hand. We should not judge our condition according to a standard of good and evil because even the best things can be used by Satan to become the most evil things. Saul of Tarsus thought that he was serving God to the uttermost, but he had no realization that his service to God was in complete opposition to God. From the time of Adam, perhaps no one has opposed God as much as Saul, even though he was not focused on evil things. Even though his service was focused on good things, he still opposed God to the uttermost. He kept the law, he was zealous, and he served God, and yet his good service was used by Satan and turned into something quite evil. If we boast in our love for the brothers, Satan can use our love against God&rsquo;s interests. Even if we are truly for the Lord, Satan can use this to oppose the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BRINGING OUR TRUE CONDITION BEFORE THE LORD</h2>
<p>We must bring our true condition before the Lord. Some of us have been elders for over two decades and bear many responsibilities in the church; others have been co-workers for over two decades and have shared in the Lord&rsquo;s work. We must bring our condition before the Lord. Satan is exceedingly subtle and pervasive; he can infiltrate even our piety and prayers. A brother may regard himself as being skillful in prayer, and even if others are not praying, he will pray by himself. It is easy to see Satan&rsquo;s infiltration and frustration when there is a lack of prayer, but it is harder to see his frustration when we pray. Often what we see is not nearly as fearful as what we cannot see. An undiagnosed disease is often more dangerous than a known disease. People do not think that Satan can infiltrate and frustrate our prayers; instead, they can see his involvement only in our idle words and gossip. It is easy to think that we cannot be touched by Satan when we pray alone in a room, but little do we realize that we are quite susceptible to Satan&rsquo;s schemes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEARING FRUIT<br />
BEING A RESULT OF SATAN&rsquo;S SCHEMES</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that a tree is known by its fruit (Matt. 7:17-18). A good tree produces good fruit, and a corrupt tree produces bad fruit. A fruitless tree is the same as a dead tree. The New Testament even speaks of a fruitless tree being in danger of being cut down (Luke 13:6-7), because without fruit a tree is useless and as good as dead. Many of us are fruitless trees. Some pray much but have no fruit. Others are quite pious but have no fruit. The number of people meeting in the church in Taipei today is less than a decade ago. There are always births and deaths in a country, but a country will decline in population over a period of only a decade if there are fewer births than deaths. We have preached the gospel and baptized many people in the past decade, but where are they? I do not believe that they have all died; instead, they have not become remaining fruit. If the number of people meeting in a district is not growing, and the brothers and sisters there are not quite dead nor fully alive, then our service to God is being used by Satan. Outwardly, the brothers and sisters may be breaking bread, remembering the Lord, and worshipping the Father, but actually, Satan has gained some ground. Having no fruit is a result of Satan&rsquo;s schemes.</p>
<p>Going to movies is clearly something of Satan&rsquo;s doing, but it is not so easy to see that Satan has influence over a person who breaks bread at the Lord&rsquo;s table and who is responsible for passing the bread and the cup. However, if death is manifested over a long period of time, we can conclude that Satan is in our service even though our service is not outwardly evil. In the Bible death is even more defiling than evil, and our barrenness is an indication of death. Our lack of fruit is an indication of death.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei&rsquo;s lack of increase in the past decade shows that it is dead, that it has been cheated by Satan. How else could a church have no increase after a decade? A physically and psychologically healthy couple will have at least a few lively children after being married for ten years. But look at the condition of the saints in the church in Taipei. If we say that we are dead, there may be a little life, but if we say that we are living, there is not much life. To the church in Sardis the Lord said, &ldquo;You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead&rdquo; (Rev. 3:1). Everything in Sardis was near the point of death (v. 2). This is the condition of the church today; it is living in name but weak to the point of death. Such a condition proves that Satan has influence in the church. We can be serving in name only, while actually opposing God, and our service for the church may actually be holding back the church. This is Satan&rsquo;s scheme. </p>
