God's economy is not to make us keepers of the law, obeying the commandments and ordinances of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose. God's economy is to make us sons of God, who inherit the blessing of God's promise, which was given for His eternal purpose. God's eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression (Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29). Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship (Eph. 1:5) and regenerated us to be His sons (John 1:12-13). We should remain in His sonship that we may become His heirs to inherit all that He has planned for His eternal expression, and should not appreciate the law and thereby be distracted to Judaism.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
