   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said that they refreshed his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You cannot find this point anywhere else in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because in this book the apostle's intention is to tell us that we have to always be in the spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1 Corinthians Paul did not say as much about himself as he did in 2 Corinthians.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But still in his first Epistle you can see that he is a person behaving, acting, working, moving, and having his being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chapters four, five, and seven show that Paul was such a person, a person absolutely in the spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to remember that 1 Corinthians is not a book for the individual believers, but a book for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to pay attention to the second verse of this book, in which Paul addresses the church of God in Corinth with all those who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not and but with all those who call upon the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If Paul had used the word and, that would mean that all the saints were standing on the same level as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But Paul used the word with, indicating that the saints belong to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we say, "The parents came with the children," this means that the children belong to the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This book was written to the church with all the saints.</S>
