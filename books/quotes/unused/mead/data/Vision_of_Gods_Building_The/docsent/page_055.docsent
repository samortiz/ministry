   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST'S BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sometimes we speak about paying the price or counting the cost for the Body life, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is indeed a price to pay, but we do not need to speak too much in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At least when we are considering the ministry of the Lord Jesus, we should not say much about the price.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we come to Paul's ministry we shall see the cost later we shall refer to this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Presently, we are dwelling on the fact that we are branches of the one vine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is it a cost, a suffering, to abide in that vine and live by that vine?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Oh, this is an enjoyment!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is very questionable whether some so-called brothers and sisters have really been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They live as if they have become members only of the Christian religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, that is a real price, a real cost to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not have a new life in their spirit, yet they are expected to have a new living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is exceedingly difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is like asking a dog to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the dog could gain the bird's life, he would need no command to fly; he would fly spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must realize that we are regenerated persons, and that this new birth is not a matter of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Formerly we were born of the flesh; now we have been born again of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the human spirit within us has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now, in our spirit, we have Christ as the Life-giving Spirit, and we must learn how to live by this source, by this Spirit; how to abide in Him and let Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we will love the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will not say that it is a suffering, but that it is an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Birds naturally enjoy flying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, a bird needs to rest at times; but after some rest, it flies again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes we need a little rest, but if we try to rest very long without meeting together, we deeply sense our need of meeting with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of whether we eat, drink, sleep, or exercise, we still must go to the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are abiding in Christ and He is abiding in us, we will realize the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By such mutual abiding, Christ will grow in us, and we will become a part of the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the whole message of John's Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Gospel of John reveals that the incarnated Christ is the tabernacle of God, the vessel containing God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This very Christ has come into us, into our spirit, as the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must learn to live by Him in our spirit, and not live by our own life in the flesh; then we will enjoy all that He is, and we will deeply sense our need of the other grains, the other branches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will spontaneously love others, and they will love us; then together we will have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way, day by day, Christ will grow in us, and we will be transformed from Adam's nature into Christ's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will gradually be translated from Adam into Christ, and we will be a real part of the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of us together with Christ will be one in the Spirit, and this will be the real building of God, the real mingling of God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is God's dwelling-place, the tabernacle, the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These things are so simple and clear; we must not make them complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must not merely think of these things, but practically apply them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ as the Life-giving Spirit first enters into our spirit, and our spirit is regenerated John 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From that time, He is the life within us, He is the strengthening power John 5 , He is the food of life John 6 , He is the living water John 7 , and He is the light within us John 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In fact, He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the secret, the one condition, is that we learn to live by Him rather than by our old life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we will become a real grain and a real branch of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We will be a grain blended with other grains, and a branch growing with other branches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We will be one in reality with others in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the enlargement of the tabernacle, and this is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the so-called churches of today we hear too many doctrines, too many messages which do not help us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must learn to live in the simple way, and help others to live in this way, for then, wherever we are, there will be a wonderful church life, there will be a real building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Oh, the church life, the real church building, is not realized by organization, gifts, or teaching!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is only realized by taking Christ as our life, living by Him, abiding in Him, and allowing Him to abide in us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the unique need today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Most Christians know that the Gospel of John speaks of the matter of life, but how many have seen the building revealed in this Gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Remember, the life is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus told the Jews, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" v. 19 . The Lord did build up God's temple in resurrection; it is Himself with His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some Christians ask how to start or organize a church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot form or organize a church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can do nothing but learn how to live by Christ, taking Him as our life, and seeking to help others live by this life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we can do this, the real oneness will be realized, and we will have the church.</S>
