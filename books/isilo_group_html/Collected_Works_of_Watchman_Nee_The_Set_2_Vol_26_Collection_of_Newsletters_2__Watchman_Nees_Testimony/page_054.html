I will be conducting a conference in this town from the twenty-fifth to the thirty-first. The first three days will be message meetings, and the last four days will be administrative meetings (all the responsible brothers and sisters from all the localities in this region will be there). Please ask the brothers and sisters in Shanghai and Hangchow to pray for us earnestly. Before this conference, I feel deeply in my spirit that the enemy is attacking us from all sides, both directly and indirectly, visibly and invisibly. It is really difficult to endure this; however, we deeply believe that the Lord Jesus is always victorious. We rely on Him and receive His victory, and we are not frightened in the least. Although darkness surrounds us and the clouds are thick, we know that it will not be long before "the Sun of righteousness" appears. Therefore, we still accept the negative things from the Lord with fortitude and proceed on as usual. Although our hearts are wounded sometimes, our spirits are always rejoicing. May the Father God bless you and us in the last stage of the way so that we would be able to walk well and arrive at God's goal. We would not stay in the world like the two and a half tribes stayed on the east of Jordan.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Huang Lu Ch'un<br />December 24</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM CH'I HSIEN CH'IAO, P'U TUNG,<br />EAST OF SHANGHAI</h2><p>To my brother in the Lord, Brother Shih:</p><p>I was graced by the Lord to have the opportunity to see you again on Monday. We do not fellowship often because of the Lord's sovereignty and the limitations of our environment and because of the fact that I am too lazy to write. In the Lord's Spirit, however, we have fellowship almost every day.</p><p>After seeing you this time, I discovered that the brothers and sisters who meet in Shanghai still care for me and the assembly here in the Lord. I was really touched and grateful. Although I have met with great difficulties and temptations since leaving the denominations, I deeply know that I am walking in the Lord's will. Therefore, my experiences of spiritual joy, peace, and victory are more frequent than before. I know that there is a new battle to fight and a new course to run in the future, but by the Lord's victory, I deeply believe that the Father will give me the grace in the Lord to endure to the end.</p><p>This Sunday someone brought Mrs. Ts'ai, who had been possessed by a demon for three or four days, into our meeting. Since becoming possessed, she had screamed and hit people night and day. She could not sleep. It was terrible. Her family was afraid of her. They had done everything that man could do but could not cast out the demon. After she came to our meeting, the demon caused her to have convulsions and then left her soon afterwards. She is saved now, along with her husband and children; the entire family of seven has turned to the Lord. Praise the Lord.</p><p>I have wanted to talk with Brother Nee several times, but because I did not know his address or have much opportunity, we never were able to talk to each other. This Monday, you drew a map for me to find his home. I went to find it the next morning, but after looking for forty-five minutes, I could not find it, so I took the boat home at noon.</p><p>There will be a conference beginning in our locality on the first day of the Chinese New Year. We would like to invite you and Brother Nee to come to our meetings. The brothers and sisters in our locality would welcome you very much. I have already written a letter directly to Brother Nee. Please invite him again for me. Give me a letter in the next two weeks telling me whether or not you can come. May you be blessed with peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chu En Sheng<br />January 5, 1935</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 26: Collection of Newsletters (2) & Watchman Nee's Testimony &nbsp; pg 54</div><br></body></html>
