   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>43.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Unto Him They Sow and of Him They Reap in Their Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Unto the Spirit the believers sow, and of the Spirit they reap in their life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians 6:8 says, "He who sows unto his own flesh, shall reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word translated "unto" in this verse also means with a view to or for.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To sow unto the flesh is to sow with a view to the flesh, or for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view, fulfilling what the flesh covets.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To sow for the fulfilling of the purpose of the flesh issues in corruption; to sow for the accomplishing of the aim of the Spirit issues in life, even eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Corruption is of the flesh, indicating that the flesh is corrupted; eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sowing covers the totality of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything we do is some kind of sowing, either to the flesh or to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wherever we may be and whatever we are doing, we are sowing seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is crucial for us to realize that the Christian walk must be a walk by the Spirit and a life of sowing unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We shall always reap what we sow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we sow unto the flesh, we shall reap corruption of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we sow unto the Spirit, we shall reap eternal life of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is very important to understand what Paul means by sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of his human experience and what he had learned and because of the revelation he received from God, Paul had a thorough understanding of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His use of the word "sow" in Galatians 6:8 points to the true meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Paul's understanding, human life is a process of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Day by day we are sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We sow by what we say and do and by what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To sow is to put forth something that will grow and eventually be reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our daily living we are constantly putting forth things that will grow and bring forth a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even a word uttered by us contains seeds that will land in a particular soil, grow, and produce a harvest that we shall reap.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "sowing" is actually equal to living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be careful in our sowing is to be watchful concerning our living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because sowing causes a certain result, Paul warned us to be careful of our sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we sow unto the flesh, we shall of the flesh reap corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if we sow unto the Spirit, we shall reap of the Spirit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, in 6:8 flesh stands in contrast to the Spirit, and corruption in contrast to eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are only two kinds of sowing and two kinds of reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no neutrality, no third kind of sowing or reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No doubt, corruption includes death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sowing unto the flesh will always produce a harvest of corruption, whereas sowing unto the Spirit will always produce a harvest of life eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul's words strongly imply that we need to make a decision with respect to our aim, our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Will our aim be the flesh, or will it be the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul speaks of sowing unto the flesh and unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To sow unto the flesh is to have the flesh as the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But to sow unto the Spirit means to sow with a view to accomplishing the purpose of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is to have the Spirit as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the Spirit should be not only our life and walk but also the goal of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no neutral ground between the flesh and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our goal is either one or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It cannot be anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As believers, we are not aimless, for we have a goal, an aim, that controls and directs us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever we do, we do with a view toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, Paul charges us to sow unto the Spirit, to live unto the Spirit, to say and do everything with a view to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to take the Spirit as our unique and eternal goal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's goal is to become the all-inclusive Spirit in us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's economy, therefore, is to give us Himself as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we should take the Spirit as our aim, our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Finally, we need to see the reason for sowing unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Galatians 6:15 Paul speaks of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul's mention of the new creation here gives us the reason for sowing unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The result of sowing unto the Spirit is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, we should sow unto the Spirit for the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we aim at the Spirit and sow unto the Spirit, the Spirit makes us a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, as we sow unto the Spirit, we shall walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then spontaneously we shall be the new creation in a practical way, for the divine Spirit will mingle Himself with us and constitute us of Himself to make us new.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For this new creation we need the Holy Spirit to work in us to keep us continually in the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then in our daily living we shall sow unto the Spirit and of the Spirit reap eternal life.</S>
