   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE NEED FOR THE PRACTICAL EXERCISE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22; 2 Cor 3:6; Gal 5:25; Rom 8:4-6 I. GOD BEING A MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is a mystery, and this mystery is in His being Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit is truly mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may illustrate this with electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we use many electrical appliances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Electricity is something practical; without it, we would not have electric lighting or microphones, so we would not be able to hold a meeting here tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although electricity is really practical and useful, we cannot see it, nor can we show it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Where is electricity?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems that since electricity is in a lightbulb, as long as we do not remove the lightbulb, the electricity is here, but once you remove the lightbulb, it is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can see by this that electricity is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another illustration is the life in our human body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I can speak, move, and show expressions because there is life in me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I die, however, I will not be able to move even though my head and hands are still here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is because life is no longer in me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Life is something real, but no one can place life before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even until today physiologists and medical doctors cannot give us an adequate explanation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can see the expressions of life, but we cannot see life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet life is very real.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These examples show us that there is a God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you consider the universe, you see that it is truly wonderful, yet it is a puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This puzzle can be explained only by tracing back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire universe depends and rests on God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, God is invisible, indescribable, and unexplainable; hence, God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FOUR GREAT MATTERS CONCERNING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible mentions four great matters concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, God created.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God created all things, and He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, God was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>People in the world can see all the things created by God, but very few know how God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know that the name of this Man is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All would agree that Jesus is a wonderful One, the most special One.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jesus is extraordinary, and He is also common.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is God, yet He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first great act of God was His creating of all things, and the second great act was His becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God entered into human flesh, put on human nature, and became a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He came out for His ministry, people saw in Him a mystery; that is, although He obviously was a man, He did things that other men could not do, and He spoke words that others could not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The words that He spoke were apparently simple, yet they were extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For instance, He said, I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He also said, I am the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And again, I am the way, the reality, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These words are simple, yet they are extraordinarily great.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not believe that anyone in the whole world could have spoken such words as Jesus did.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>None of the philosophers and wise men ever spoke such words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one is as wonderful as Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jesus is wonderful because He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The third great thing concerning God is that in the flesh He became our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every one of us is fallen and corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus came to save us by bearing our sins through His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The cross is excellent and special.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Creation, incarnation, and crucifixion are three great things that God did.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, these three great things are for the fourth great thing His becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The reason for His creation, His incarnation, and His redemption is to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His purpose in all this is to give life to man.</S>
