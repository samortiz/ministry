   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Functioning in the Meetings of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the church, we need to function in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The proper church life depends upon proper church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Proper church meetings are unique in two matters in mutuality and in speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we meet together, we need to have mutuality in our speaking, rather than only one or two persons speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every saint should have the same right and opportunity to speak of Christ, to speak for Christ, and to speak forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Depending on others to speak, to pray, and to call the hymns is a tradition that kills the church life, because it annuls the function of the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not follow this traditional practice; instead, we should function in the church meetings in the way of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will edify, improve, and develop the ability to function of all those who attend the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In every meeting of the church we should keep the principle of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the New Testament, Christian meetings are altogether meetings in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 14:26 each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these things are done in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only one or a few should function; on the contrary, everyone should function in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 10:25 encourages us not to abandon our own assembling together but to exhort one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that Christian meetings should be carried out in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mutuality is the basic principle of church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A church meeting without mutuality is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our meetings, speaking the divine word should be done in mutuality, not individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mutuality, not individuality, should be our general practice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Meeting and speaking in mutuality is the way ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God created this way, and no one can improve upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, we must forsake the traditional practice of having only one speaker, or several speakers, and recover the way of mutuality that the Lord has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to fully return to the way of meeting as ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even when the entire church comes together, we must practice mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Corinthians 14:26 indicates that when the whole church comes together, there should be the practice of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The matter of speaking in mutuality is clearly revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament there is no hint that only one or two persons should speak in a church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The meetings of the church should be open to all who attend so that all may function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let all things be done for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this verse the word has is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Paul, whenever we come together to meet, each of us has something.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul does not say shall have or should have ; he speaks in the present tense to emphasize the fact that each one of us has something.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, he does not say that just a few have, that many have, or that most have; he says each one has.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He then speaks of five things in the following sequence: a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This list is not all-inclusive, but it is illustrative.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Having a Psalm</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul first speaks of having a psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A psalm is somewhat equivalent to a hymn; it is for praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fact that Paul speaks first of a psalm indicates that in the church meetings praising the Lord is primary.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Having a Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After saying, Each one has a psalm, Paul goes on to speak of having a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A teaching must be according to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the church meetings we need a word of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This teaching should minister Christ with the church as His Body.</S>
