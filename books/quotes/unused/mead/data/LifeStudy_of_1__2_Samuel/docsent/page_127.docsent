   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S BUILDING THE MINGLING OF DIVINITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH OUR REDEEMED, RESURRECTED,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND UPLIFTED HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus declared, "I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How does Christ build His church?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He builds the church not merely by saving sinners and making them believers and members of Himself but by building Himself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we believed in Christ, He came into us and began the work of gradually building Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible there is the line concerning God's building Himself in Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This matter of building is therefore mentioned strongly and repeatedly in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the divine revelation in the Bible, God is building by working Himself in Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This involves the mingling of divinity with our redeemed, resurrected, and uplifted humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is working Himself in Christ into us to make a house not only for us but to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This house will be both God's house and our house, a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, the Triune God and redeemed humanity will be mingled, blended, and built up to be one entity, and this entity will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we see this, we will realize that all our problems today are due to one thing our shortage of having God in Christ built into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, our need today is not merely to be holy, spiritual, and overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our need is for God to carry out His building work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A SEED OF MAN BECOMING THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What a great light the Lord has shown us from 2 Samuel 7!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God revealed to David that his seed, a seed of man v. 12 , would become the Son of God v. 14 . How can this be? The answer is that a human seed is designated the Son of God Rom 1:3-4 . Humanity is designated in divinity, and divinity and humanity are blended as one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, we, seeds of humanity, are becoming sons of God in divinity through the process of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We praise the Lord that in His recovery on the earth today, we are undergoing the work of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is fulfilling His desire to build Himself in Christ into our being, and eventually the outcome of this building will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</S>
