This implies that they dare not acknowledge the humanity of Christ.</li>		<li>Some Christians do not believe that after His resurrection Christ is still a man through His ascension, coming back, reigning in the millennium, and being the heavenly ladder in eternity. Probably even a good number of Christian teachers make the same mistake unconsciously.</li>		</ol>	</ol></ol>
