   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE ORGAN FOR EATING THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov 20:27; Isa 57:15; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>36:26-27; John 3:6; 4:24; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22; John 6:63 I. THREE GREAT THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Zechariah 12:1 shows us that in the eyes of God there are three great things in this universe: the heavens, the earth, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the universe God pays attention to the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, do not despise yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You have a spirit within you, and your spirit is ranked with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God needs the heavens and the earth, and even more He needs your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we see how important our human spirit is, we will be very excited.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does God consider the human spirit as important as the heavens and the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is because the human spirit is a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The heavens are for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without the heavens, the earth could not survive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The things we enjoy on earth, such as sunshine and rain, come from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the earth is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Things brought forth by the earth, such as crops, are suitable to meet man s needs for his survival.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the most precious thing in man is his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The human spirit is for God; it is used to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>MAN HAVING A SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people, including even Christians, do not know that there is a spirit in them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must pay attention to the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To eat food, you cannot use your eyes, ears, or nose; you must use your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The mouth is the organ for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order for man to eat, God created the eating organ, the mouth, in a marvelous way: the lips for sucking, the teeth for grinding, the tongue for pushing, and the saliva for mixing; all are for eating food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this we see that God Himself is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then which organ do we use to eat the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The human spirit is the organ for us to eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God created a spirit for us that we may eat Him, enjoy Him, and receive Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have within us a stomach to contain physical food and a spirit to contain spiritual food, which is God Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>WHAT THE SPIRIT IS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Where is the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is hard to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is even difficult to know our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How many hearts do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have a biological heart and a psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only is God a mystery, but even you and I are mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some of the most precious things are very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, electricity, life, and atomic energy are mysterious and even invisible, yet they are real.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Within us the most mysterious thing is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What really is the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is hard for the mind to understand; we can know the spirit only by experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For instance, many times our mind reasons out a certain matter and our will is also in agreement, but deep within us there is something troubling us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That something is a mysterious thing, which is unexplainable, and that is the story of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Take another case: When a man is poor, all he needs is clothing, food, and shelter, and all he thinks about is how to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After he becomes rich and all these material necessities are fully supplied, then he feels the need for recreation and amusement, such as music and sports.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet after all these needs have been met, he still feels an emptiness deep within him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then one day he calls, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is then that he is satisfied within.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This deepest need is neither physical nor psychological but spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only God can satisfy this need.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This need is evidence that we have a spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>TWO KINDS OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now let us talk about prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are at least two kinds of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first kind is to pray with the intellect or the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The words of your prayer may be correct, but because you pray with the wrong organ, your prayer is not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you ask a professor of psychology to pray, he might pray and pray, going round and round in his mind; eventually he may even pray God away.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is because the human mind cannot contact God, just as a piece of wood cannot make electrical contact.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If one is willing to call, O Lord, then the Spirit will come, and he will touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, the second kind of prayer is to pray with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all must exercise to make our spirit strong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christianity teaches people to pray to an objective God, a God who is high above on the throne, begging Him to have pity on them and to do things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This kind of religious prayer by religious teaching is altogether in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>True prayer is to pray with your spirit in order to contact the subjective Lord, who is in you and with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today He is not only sitting high above on the throne, but He is also dwelling in your spirit in a lowly way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, when you pray to Him, you should not only make requests of Him, but you should touch and contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This kind of prayer for contacting Him is to pray not with the mind but with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord said that He is the bread of life and that we have to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How do we eat Him?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not by considering Him with our mind but by calling O Lord! with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Suppose your husband or your wife or a brother or a sister insults you, provoking you to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This will stir up your mind to think, How unreasonable this is!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How can he do this to me?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then your whole being will be usurped by the mind, and even though you pray, you will not be able to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, we must learn how to contact the Lord with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To contact Him, who is Spirit, we must use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He as the Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In our spirit there is a mutual fellowship and a mingling of the two spirits.</S>
