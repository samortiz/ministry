<h1 class="title">DYING TO LAW AND LIVING TO GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:19-20; Phil. 1:20-21; Rom. 7:4, 6</h1>
<p>In Galatians 2:19-20 Paul says, &ldquo;I through law have died to law that I might live to God. I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.&rdquo; These two verses cover God&rsquo;s redemption. In this chapter we will focus on verse 19, which speaks of dying to law and living to God. In order to experience God as life, a Christian must know what it is to die to law and what it is to live to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL INTENTION AND<br />
THE CREATION OF MAN</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal intention is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. This thought was in God&rsquo;s heart in eternity past, before He created the heavens and the earth. God in the Son and as the Spirit wants to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and to be mingled with man as one. He wants to be man&rsquo;s content, and He wants man to express Him. This is the intention that God ordained in eternity past.</p>
<p>Creation was the first step that God took in fulfilling His intention. God created the universe and all things in it, and then He created man as a vessel for His expression. His creation of man differs from His creation of other living creatures. He did two particular things when He created man. First, He made man in His own image and according to His own likeness (Gen. 1:26). He made man so that he would be suitable for His expression. If we want to make a vessel, we should first consider the purpose and the goal of the vessel before deciding on the shape of the vessel. Furthermore, we should consider whether the vessel would contain a solid or a liquid. This was how God created man. He made man in His image and according to His likeness so that man would be suitable to contain and express Him.</p>
<p>The second particular thing that God did was to form a human spirit within man (Zech. 12:1). This is the biggest difference between man and all other creatures. Eagles and monkeys are agile, but they do not have a spirit. Lions and tigers are fierce and powerful, but they do not have a spirit. Elephants and whales are much bigger than man, but they do not have a spirit. Man is special because he has a human spirit. Hence, man is the highest organism on the earth because he has a human spirit, not because he is more nimble, more powerful, bigger, or taller than other organisms.</p>
<p>The human spirit is a special organ entirely for contacting and receiving God. In order to contact something, we must use the appropriate organ. Just as God created man with a stomach in order for man to receive food, He also created man with a spirit in order for man to contact and receive Him. If we did not have a stomach, we would be unable to digest food. Similarly, God created us with a human spirit in order for us to receive Him.</p>
<p>Culture and education neglect the human spirit. Physical education deals with the physical body and is in the realm of the body. Intellectual education deals with the mind, and moral education largely deals with ethical choices related to our will. Both intellectual and moral education are in the realm of the soul. There is, however, no aspect of education that focuses on the human spirit. Even religion merely cultivates man&rsquo;s soul. Religion does not touch the human spirit. We must understand that our relationship with God is in our spirit. It is a relationship of the spirit. God created us with a human spirit so that by means of this spirit we may contact Him and receive Him.</p>
<p>Man possesses God&rsquo;s image and God&rsquo;s likeness, and he has the capacity to contain God for His expression. This is possible because God created a receiving organ in man so that man might receive Him. Thus, God is able to enter into man and to be expressed through man. These are the preparatory steps that God took when He created man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S CHOICE AND HIS FALL</h2>
<p>After creating man, God placed man in front of the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9). The tree of life signifies God coming to be life to man. God desired to enter into man, but instead of appearing to man as the glorious and great God, He presented Himself as the tree of life, having no display of honor or glory, as food in order to be eaten by man. Many people think that God always manifests Himself in a splendid and majestic manner. However, this is not the way that He presented Himself to man. He humbled Himself, presenting Himself as the tree of life in order to be food to man. The Lord Jesus came to the earth in the same way. He did not come in splendor or majesty; rather, He humbly said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven&rdquo; (John 6:51). He was so humble and accessible that even little children were not afraid to come to Him (Matt. 19:13-14). God placed man before the tree of life, showing that His intention was to be food for man in order to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>God also wanted to let man know that there was a problem in the universe. God had an adversary, an enemy, who was contending and struggling with Him. Everything that this enemy did was with the intention of destroying God&rsquo;s work. Hence, in addition to the tree of life, God caused the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to also grow (Gen. 2:9). God then warned man that the result of contacting this tree is death (v. 17; Rom. 5:12). The tree of the knowledge of good and evil refers to Satan. Satan can give man only the knowledge of good and evil. Satan is the tree of knowledge, which is related to good and evil. He is also the result of receiving mere knowledge; that is, he is the tree of death. On one side, there is the tree of life, which only involves life. On the other side, there is another tree, which involves the knowledge of good and evil and results in death. God presented Himself as food for man to eat, and Satan also wanted to enter into man. Satan imitates God in everything that He does. Sometimes Satan goes ahead of God to imitate what God will do. God has such an enemy. Hence, when God put the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden, He warned the man whom He had created, saying, &ldquo;Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:16-17). This word was not only a command but also a warning.</p>
<p>God gave man two choices in order to manifest that He is great. God does not want to force His will on man. The use of such force would not be pleasant. God was pleased to let the man, whom He had created, exercise his free will to choose God. It pleases God for man to choose Him according to his own will. This is also a great shame to Satan. If God had forced man to receive Him, Satan could have accused God, saying, &ldquo;You forced Yourself into man. That was not the voluntary choice of Your creature.&rdquo; By not forcing man to receive Him, God sealed Satan&rsquo;s mouth. God intended to show Satan that man has absolute freedom and self-will. Man can make choices according to his will. When God placed man between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, He gave man the opportunity to choose between Himself and Satan. Man had the opportunity to eat either of the tree of life or of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that is, to choose God or Satan. Furthermore, God told man that the result of choosing Satan was death.</p>
<p>God was willing to wait for man to choose Him, but Satan could not wait. Satan came in quickly to do something, to seduce, steal, and lure man away from God. Man was seduced by Satan to eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thus received Satan (3:1-6). As a result, man had three problems related to sin. First, he committed a sinful deed. Second, he now had a record of sin before God. Third, Satan&rsquo;s sinful nature entered into man; thus, man possesses the evil nature of Satan. This evil nature is called sin (singular), as in Romans 6 through 8. Within man there is something living called sin. Our outward behavior, our sins, come out of the inward nature of sin that was injected into us by Satan. Satan poisoned us by injecting sin into us. As a result, we have a sinful nature, which produces many sinful deeds.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
