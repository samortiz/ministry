<h2 class="head1">III. THE LORD JESUS ESTABLISHING<br />THE PATTERN OF SUBMISSION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Lord Jesus Being<br />the Perfect Submissive One</h2><p>When Jesus of Nazareth appeared, He was God's chosen One on earth. He said that He spoke only what He heard and that He could do nothing from Himself except what He saw the Father doing (John 5:19). He did not seek His own will but the will of the One who sent Him (v. 30). Here was a man who would not speak or act by Himself. He submitted fully to God's authority.</p><p>The Lord Jesus is God Himself. Yet He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself fully under God's authority. After His death on the cross, God raised Him from among the dead and highly exalted Him to be the Lord and Christ and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Phil. 2:5-11).</p><p>The Lord formed His church after His ascension. He did not establish His church in the way that men establish a society or an organization. The resurrected and ascended Lord is now the Head of the church. The church is His Body. In other words, He wants to manifest the submissive life which He lived on earth through the church today.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Gospel Being<br />a Commandment for Submission</h2><p>The gospel constitutes a commandment in the Bible. The Bible shows us that after one hears the gospel, he should believe. But at the time he believes the gospel, he should also submit to the gospel. The Holy Spirit is given to those who obey God (Acts 5:32). We are people who have obeyed from our hearts the word which was preached to us (Rom. 6:17). Please bear in mind that the receiving of the Lord Jesus and our faith and salvation in Him are related to obedience. This is God's commandment; He is charging men everywhere to believe in it. Therefore, to believe is to submit. A person should learn to submit to the Lord and to God's authority from the first day he enters the church.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Underlying Principle<br />of the Church Being Submission</h2><p>History throughout the ages shows that the whole world is in rebellion. The underlying principle of the world is an overthrow of either God's direct authority or His appointed authority. Today is the age when the Body of the Lord, that is, the church, is built on earth. The underlying principle of the church should be the principle of submission. God puts a high demand on the church; He wants to secure what He originally planned to secure in the world. Today in the church God puts a high stake on the woman; she must submit to the man. How difficult it is for God to secure such a thing in the world! If you ask a woman in the world today whether she is willing to submit to man, she will feel that such a demand makes no sense. Yet in the church today, God demands that the woman be submissive to the man, and the wife to the husband.</p><p>Ephesians and Colossians are lofty books, but what kind of commandments do we find in these Epistles? They tell us that wives should be subject to their husbands, children to their parents, and slaves to their masters. This is not something that can be found in the world; it can be found only in the church.</p><p>Ephesians and Colossians touch the highest things. They show us that we were once sons of disobedience. Just like the world, our former principle of life was rebellion. We were called sons of disobedience. Today God has given us a commandment: Wives should be subject to their husbands, children to their parents, and slaves to their masters. This is something different from the whole world. This shows us that submission is the basic principle of the church today.</p>
