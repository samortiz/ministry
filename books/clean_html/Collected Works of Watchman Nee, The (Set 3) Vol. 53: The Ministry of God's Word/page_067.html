<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />BURDEN AND THE OUTER WORDS</h2><p>Three necessary steps constitute the ministry of the word: light, thoughts, and word. There are two aspects of the word: the inner words and the outer words. In order to simplify things, we should say that there are four steps: light, thoughts, the inner words, and the outer words.</p><p>What are the outer words? What is the relationship between the inner words and the outer words? Their relationship is like the relationship between thoughts and light. These are all spiritual facts and can never be shaken. We have mentioned previously that the light will fly away once it shines within us if there is no thought to capture the light. It will run from our grasp and not be useful to us. Similarly, once we receive one or two inner words, we have to release them through outer words. The inner words consist of one or two sentences. These one or two sentences of God's speaking cannot be understood or accepted if they are released in isolation. They have to be complemented with many other words. In addition to one or two words from God, we must have many other words before we can serve as a minister. God grants us the light of His word, and God also transforms this light into inner words. But this is not enough; we also must have many outer words. An inner word that is without complement is in a form that cannot be accepted readily; it is too condensed. If we release this word in its primitive form, others will not be able to understand it. It will be too strong, too condensed, and too compact to be accepted by others. When the inner word is released, it must be accompanied by many other words. Only then will we be able to effectively express the inner word. Perhaps two thousand words are needed to convey one word from God. Perhaps five thousand or ten thousand words are needed to convey that one word. We have to employ our own words to convey God's word. This is the meaning of the ministry of the word.</p><p>Here we see the need of human elements. In capturing the light with our mind, the human element is involved. Some minds are not capable of this work, while other minds are sufficient. This is the first point at which the human element becomes involved. It is again involved later in the search for outer words. Some people are able to furnish suitable outer words to convey God's word. Others cannot find suitable words to properly convey God's word. Human elements account for a tremendous difference here.</p><h2 class="head2">Inner Words Must Be Released<br />by Means of Outer Words</h2><p>The inner words are in a very condensed form; no one can receive them into him. The outer words are more diluted and can be accepted more readily. Our responsibility is to take care of the outer words. The responsibility for the outer words lies with man, that is, with the minister. A minister's responsibility is to "dilute" God's condensed word and make it easier for others to accept. The inner words are cryptic and condensed, whereas the outer words are lengthy and diluted. Others cannot receive the inner words; they can only receive the outer words. We receive the one or two sentences from God when we receive the second revelation. But after we receive these sentences, we still need many other words to help us release them. Hence, a minister of the word must first receive a divine word from God and then release this word with his own words. Only as we understand this process can we understand the meaning of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The pure word that men receive from God does not vary much. Yet when this word was spoken through Peter, it carried Peter's flavor. When it was released through John, it carried John's flavor. When it was released through Paul, it carried Paul's flavor. If one can read the Greek New Testament, he can easily tell which books were written by Peter, which ones by John, and which ones by Paul, because, even though they all contain God's word, they were all written differently. Peter was one kind of person, John was another kind of person, and Paul was yet a third kind of person. When God's word was spoken through Peter, the teaching was God's, but the flavor was Peter's. When God's word was spoken through John, the teaching was God's, but the flavor was John's. When God's word was spoken through Paul, the teaching was God's, but the flavor was Paul's. Human elements are present in the ministry of God's word. God lays His hand upon men chosen by the Spirit and releases His word through them. He indeed is the One who gives the word, yet He wants men to release it in their own words. Those who have learned many lessons before the Lord will speak as those who have learned many lessons. Those who have learned few lessons before the Lord will speak as those who have learned few lessons. God's word is entrusted to man, and man is commissioned to release God's word.</p>
