This is too great a thing in the universe. Whether one considers it from the point of view of serving the Lord, or from the point of view of being a testimony for the Lord, the matter is not small. Both expressions are tremendous expressions.<p>We say that we are serving the Lord. But who is this Lord? This is not a small thing. If I could meet the head of a state face to face, I would feel quite extraordinary. But this is only to serve man. We have to see that the Lord is higher and more glorious than any man. We serve the Lord Christ. Many times we have spoken about the service of the Lord in too low a term and have considered it too lightly. Furthermore, to testify for the Lord is not a light matter either.<p>Our thoughts and concepts have to be delivered from frivolity and degradation. Whenever we talk about serving the Lord, we have to be serious. Whenever we mention service to the Lord, we have to consider it a tremendous matter. We are serving a God that is the Lord of heaven and earth and the One who is the highest of all. We can illustrate it in another way. If the President of our nation were going to see you this morning, perhaps your heart would have beaten much faster when you woke up in the morning. Perhaps in the night you would not sleep too well. There is nervousness, and there is fear. However, when we talk about serving the Lord today, often we are quite insensitive. We have to realize that we are serving the Lord of heaven and earth. If any man says that he is serving the Lord yet has no feeling whatsoever, it proves that such a person has degraded. We have to be watchful concerning this.<h2 class=head1>SERVING THE LORD REQUIRING A GLORIOUS VISION</h2><p>Following this, we have to see the glorious vision. Everyone who serves the Lord must have a glorious vision. It is not the seeing that is glorious; rather, it is the object which we see that is glorious. This in turn makes the seeing itself glorious. This is what we mean by a glorious vision.<p>The word vision means something extraordinary, unusual, uncommon, and strange. It also means a scene or a scenery. It is a kind of special seeing. One sees because a scenery is there. A few hundred of you are sitting here. This is a very beautiful scenery. If I had a camera, I would capture this on my film. Hence, a vision is a special kind of seeing. We have to know that to serve God is not an ordinary matter. This is because the Lord is not ordinary. If we do not have any feeling concerning serving the Lord and being a testimony for Him, we are those without a vision.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S SERVICE REQUIRING THE LORD&#8217;S CALLING</h2><p>From the whole Bible, we can see that every servant of the Lord begins by being called. This is like our taking up a job and receiving a letter of acceptance. Our calling is similar to this today. It is not the church which is calling you, nor is it the work of the gospel team which is calling you, it is the Lord Himself who has called you. When you are called, you receive the vision. The calling of the Lord is the appearing of the God of glory to you. He does not appear to you without reason. God&#8217;s appearing to you is His calling you. It makes you a called one.<h2 class=head2>The Calling of Abraham</h2><p>Abraham was the first called one in the Bible. Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, and Noah were before Abraham; but the Bible does not mention how these five were called. For example, in the case of Abel the book of Genesis only tells us that after he was born he experienced God under his parents&#8217; guidance.<p>Enosh knew God and served Him, and the Bible says that from that time on, man began to call on the name of Jehovah (Gen. 4:26). But the Bible does not say how he was called. The same is true with Enoch and Noah. It is not until we come to Abraham that a new thing is mentioned in the Old Testament, which is that God came to call Abraham. At that time, Abraham was in Ur of Chaldea (11:31). He was not there serving or worshipping God; rather, he was there worshipping idols. The land of Chaldea was a land of idolatry; it was full of idols. It was also where the tower of Babel was. Hence, the place was filled with idols. Under such a circumstance, the God of glory appeared to Abraham. He was the first called one in the Old Testament.<h2 class=head2>The Calling of the Apostle Paul</h2><p>In the New Testament, we can see that the Apostle Paul was also called by the Lord. His former name was Saul. While he was on his way to Damascus with the letter of the high priest to bind those who called on the name of the Lord, the glory of the Lord appeared to him (Acts 9:2-3). The appearing of the Lord is the glory of the Lord. This appearing captured Paul, and he was called. Abraham in the Old Testament was called while worshipping idols. Paul in the New Testament was called while on his way to bind men calling on the name of the Lord. This is indeed wonderful.<h2 class=head2>Our Calling</h2><p>According to our experience, once the Lord appears to us, we are not the same. From then on, we are being called. When the Bible mentions the calling of Abraham, the record was brief. It only says that Abraham was then living in Mesopotamia, and that the God of glory appeared to him. As far as God is concerned, it is an appearing. As far as we are concerned, it is a vision and a seeing-a very particular seeing, a seeing that we have never experienced before. We have seen mountains, rivers, birds, animals, flowers, and many other things before. But this is different. Suddenly such a One appears to us. This appearing is the calling of God. In other words, you are called. If you do not accept this calling, you are rejecting the vision of God.<p>However, the Bible shows us that when God appeared to man, no one could reject Him. The vision is too wonderful. Some of the idols Abraham was worshipping had faces of demons; others had faces of horses or were birds in a temple. These were the things Abraham worshipped. History tells us that every brick in the temple of Babel had an image on it. While Abraham was worshipping these idols, suddenly a scene appeared to him. This scene was absolutely different from all the idols. This scene was just God Himself. The God of glory appeared with such splendor and majesty that the vision captured Abraham. In this way he was called. It was in this condition of calling that God told Abraham, &#8220;Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father&#8217;s house, unto a land that I will show thee&#8221; (Gen. 12:1). From that time on, Abraham was called. He is the first called one in the Old Testament. In addition to this one, there were at least two others who were called. One was Isaiah, and the other was Ezekiel. Both became prophets as a result of their calling.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S CALLING BEING HIS PERSONAL REVELATION TO US</h2><p>How does God call us? He calls us by drawing us to Himself through opening Himself up to us. In some places in the world, there are night markets. The merchants there lay out their beautiful, bargain goods by bundles and cases before the customers. This gives people a strong impression. Many are attracted by these night markets and shop there. I hope that some among you will see God Himself in a similar way and will be captured by such a glorious vision.<p>I still remember the experience of the God of glory appearing to me for the first time. That was on the afternoon of the day I was saved. When I walked out of the meeting hall into the street, I felt that everything was different. I stopped by the road and prayed to God, &#8220;God! I don&#8217;t want anything else anymore. I only want Yourself.&#8221; This was the God of glory appearing to me. I hope that in principle, you would all have the same experience. Do not be like the Christian missionaries. They serve the Lord as a profession. I hope that every one serving the Lord in His recovery would have this glorious vision breaking and shining upon him at least once. This is not a matter of any outward seeing. Rather, it is a definite and glorious inward seeing.<h2 class=head1>A VISION THAT TURNS THE WHOLE BEING</h2><p>After we have this glorious seeing, our entire being will be changed in its concept, attitude, conversation, and thought. We will be thoroughly different. Although we still eat, drink, rest, and work, our whole person will be changed. This is a response to our seeing a vision. Whenever we see a vision we have a response. For example, when you go to the zoo and see a fierce tiger, you will surely have a response. The vision that you see will make you beside yourself. Your concepts will be changed, and your walk and living will become uncommon.<p>I still remember the condition I was in when I was called immediately after I was saved. Others began to feel differently about me. Not only did outsiders feel differently about me, even my own family felt that I was different. They thought that I was depressed or that I did not sleep well. They observed that I began to lose interest in everything. Although all of you may not be the same as I was, I do believe that a good number of brothers and sisters have had a similar experience. Others notice that we are different. Perhaps the change does not occur the day we are saved. But three days later, or three months, perhaps even three years later, there is a thorough change. Sooner or later, the appearing of God and our spiritual vision will make us different from others. The world can never explain this. They cannot understand it, because they have never seen anything like it.<p>Furthermore, we know that after seeing such a vision, our whole life-style is changed. For example, formerly I may have loved the world very much, but now I gladly relinquish it. Money becomes tasteless. Fashion becomes tasteless, and amusement becomes tasteless. Everything becomes tasteless. But this is not all. The wonderful thing is that, on the positive side, the word of the Lord becomes tasteful, and God becomes attractive. Those who do not understand this may think that we have a mental problem, because our reaction is too different and too extraordinary! However, we know that there is nothing wrong with us. The only thing that happened is that our whole being has had an inward turn. From that day on, for us the world changed its color. It was a genuine change. This world has become absolutely tasteless to us. On the positive side, our life becomes full of meaning, glory, and purpose because of the Lord. This proves that we have seen the glorious vision.<p>When this God of glory unveils Himself to us, our lives are changed. This can neither be imitated nor denied. For a while, you may become somewhat cold, or weak, or may be slightly backslidden, or depressed. But you cannot forget the vision. Even if you go back to the world and desire for the world, the feeling within you will not be the same. You will sense no taste for it. God will raise up an environment to turn you back. He will unveil His glory to you again and will make you consecrate yourself back to this God of glory.<h2 class=head1>THE VISION CONTROLLING THE GOSPEL OUTREACH</h2><p>This morning, I hope that every one who is going to participate in the gospel outreach is a man of vision. It must not be that some others are persuading you to join the gospel outreach. Persuasion will work for only three days. I am afraid that after three days, it will become useless. It has to be something that touches you within, which is the God of glory unveiling Himself to you and enlightening you, who will give you unspeakable strength for you to go on in serving the Lord step by step.<p>When I came back to Taiwan a few days ago, I received a call from one of the gospel teams. The brothers and sisters were very excited. They told me that within three weeks they had baptized eighty-two persons. The first Lord&#8217;s Day they had twenty-three new ones attending their bread-breaking meeting. This is indeed encouraging. But we have to see that such excitement will ebb quickly if there is not a vision as the underlying support. It is like the weather that we have been experiencing these few days. At times a cold front comes, and the temperature goes down and up erratically. But if you have seen the vision, whether there is a cold front or a warm front, you will not be affected. We have to realize that we have the outreach in the villages because we have seen an inward vision. This glorious vision controls us and gives us the boldness to go on.<h2 class=head1>THE VISION BRINGING IN THE SPEAKING OF GOD</h2><p>At present, we very much encourage the brothers and sisters to prophesy in the district meetings on the Lord&#8217;s Day. This is to speak for God. However, there is a basic qualification to speak for God which is that we must first see God. For you to describe my appearance to others without having first seen me is a rather difficult thing to do. Nor could you say much. But while you are sitting here this morning in this meeting, you see my every slightest move, and you will have a lot to say to others about me. Hence, if we want to prophesy and to speak for the Lord, we must first have fellowship with the Lord. We must see Him and know Him before we can speak Him forth.<p>We also must deeply realize that our outreach is not a kind of work. Rather, it is a going out in ecstasy. If we are not ecstatic, the gospel outreach will not be effective. If we see the vision, our going out for the work will be different. When Isaiah was called by God to speak for Him, he did not go forth to give predictions. Rather, he spoke words of rebuke to others.<p>The majority of the sixty-six chapters of Isaiah were a speaking for God. The reason Isaiah spoke was because God had granted him the vision. He saw the God of glory sitting on the throne, and he said, &#8220;Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts&#8221; (6:5). This is Isaiah&#8217;s message. In 1:9 he said, &#8220;Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.&#8221; He had truly seen the vision and had come forth to speak for the Lord.<p>I hope that every one of you who are going to participate in the outreach in the villages would also have such an inward vision. Whenever you see people, there is the burden within to speak, even to speak unceasingly like a &#8220;madman.&#8221; In the Old Testament, every prophet was a &#8220;madman.&#8221; In the New Testament, every apostle was also a &#8220;madman.&#8221; Every evangelist is all the more a &#8220;madman.&#8221; I have noticed that the brothers and sisters in the five teams that have gone out are a little bit crazy. I believe that more or less it is because they have been affected by the vision that they have received.<p>We can take a look again at the story of the calling of Peter, James, and John. While they were fishing, the Lord called them (Matt. 4:18-22). But that call did not affect them too much. One day the three of them followed the Lord Jesus to go up to the mountain. On the mountain the Lord suddenly was transfigured. His face shone like the sun, and His garment became white as the light (Matt. 17:2). Later Peter told us in his Epistle that he was an eyewitness of the Lord&#8217;s majesty on the mount of transfiguration. This is not merely a seeing of the glory of the Lord. It is a beholding of His majesty. Glory is comparatively common. But majesty brings people awe. Peter said that he made known the things to us because he became an eyewitness to the Lord&#8217;s majesty. What he made known to us was not cleverly devised myths, but was what he had seen with his own eyes (2 Pet. 1:16).<p>Now we know why Peter and John were so powerful when they preached the gospel and worked for the Lord. The reason is that they had all seen a vision. This vision was their calling. The majesty that they saw became the message that they preached. Hence, if we are to give ourselves to the move of the gospel outreach, we must first see the glorious vision.<h2 class=head1>A LIFETIME OF SERVING GOD ACCORDING TO THE VISION</h2><p>When the Apostle John was old, he was exiled to the island of Patmos. There he saw scene after scene of visions. The whole book of Revelation from the first chapter to the last is on visions. The last scene is the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22). Hence, you can see that what John spoke were the visions that he saw. He was not telling people stories; rather, he was speaking to others every aspect of what he saw. This is the book of Revelation. It is truly an unveiling.<p>I hope that when you go down to the villages for the outreach, you will speak to others about the vision that you have seen. That will become a revelation to others. This will not be merely some empty teachings. Instead, what you tell others will be a vision that you have seen. This will become others&#8217; revelation. By this they will also be able to see. This is what I mean by the glorious vision.<p>Second Peter 1:3 says that God &#8220;has called us to His own glory and virtue.&#8221; In the New Testament, every saved person should be one who has received God&#8217;s glorious calling. We have all seen His glory, have been attracted by Him, and are under His influence. We can no longer be the same as we were, common worldly persons. We are a special people, because the Lord has called us. We do not care about heaven or earth. This glory that we have seen is the meaning of our life. It has also become our goal, our commission, and our burden. We do not care what the circumstance is nor what others think of us. There is something within us which we cannot deny or disobey. It is the glorious vision. We have to serve God according to this vision throughout our whole life.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on March 7, 1989)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE GLORIOUS VISION AND THE WAY OF THE CROSS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:24-26; Luke 9:57-62; Phil. 3:10; Rev. 1:9; Acts 20:24; 2 Tim. 4:7-8; 1 Cor. 9:27; Heb. 12:1-3</h1><p>In the previous chapter we covered the glorious vision. In this chapter we move on to talk about the way of the cross. Where there is a vision, there is a way. The glorious vision always leads us onto a way. If we have the seeing, there must also be the walking. This walk is the way of the cross.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF THE CROSS PRIMARILY BEING &#8220;NO MORE I&#8221;</h2><p>Many people equate the cross with suffering. Actually, the cross is not primarily a matter of suffering. During the fifteenth century, Thomas &#224; Kempis wrote the book The Imitation of Christ. In China, this book was soon translated into Chinese by the Catholics. There was a thorough discussion of the cross in this book. However, the whole subject was distorted in that it considered the cross a kind of suffering. Even Madame Guyon was under this book&#8217;s influence.<p>We know that in the New Testament, the primary meaning of the cross is not to suffer but to be killed. When a person is nailed on the cross, there is not merely the suffering but also execution. The very person is removed. The New Testament shows us that the first one to be crucified was the Lord Jesus. When men crucified Him on the cross, not only did He suffer, He was being done away with. Hymns, #622 says:<p class=hbody>If we take up the cross, will we but suffer pain? Nay, if we bear the cross, be sure that we will die! The meaning of the cross is that we may be slain; The cross experienced the self will crucify.<p>Once we have seen the vision, the vision will surely send us on the way of the cross. The emphasis of such a way is not suffering but being &#8220;no more I.&#8221; The way of the cross is the way of being no more I. Those who are on this way have all put themselves aside. There is only Christ, and there is only God.<h2 class=head1>TO DENY THE SELF BEING TO ALLOW THE LORD TO BE THE PERSON</h2><p>Many of you are married. Marriage makes the living of two persons one. Before you are married, you can make whatever suggestions you want. But after you are married, you cannot do so as easily. Marriage life requires the cross. The husband needs to die, and the wife also needs to die. If so, then who will live? Christ lives and God lives. All over the world, it is difficult to find a couple which really lives as one. The wonderful thing about us who believe in the Lord is that after we have received the Lord as our life, there are now two persons in our being. We ourselves are one person, and the Lord is another person. Who then has the say? I want to impress you that the meaning of the cross is the putting aside of you. By the cross, your whole being and your whole life is being put aside.<p>In the New Testament, the self is frequently mentioned and the soul is also. If we compare Luke 9 with Matthew 16, we can see that the self and the soul both point to the same thing. In Matthew the soul is mentioned (16:26), whereas in Luke the self is mentioned (9:25). Therefore, the soul is the self, and the self is the soul. We have a hymn concerning denying the self, and we also have a hymn concerning denying the soul. More than twenty years ago, there was a brother who objected to one of the hymns I had written. He said that it was wrong to deny the soul. According to this brother, the soul is the person. Once you deny the soul, there will be no more you, that is, you will no longer live. He did not know that to deny the soul in the Bible is not to deny the functions of the soul, that is, the mind, emotion, and will. Rather, it is to deny the person of the soul and the life of the self. It does not mean that you will not function anymore. Rather, it means that it is no longer you who live.<p>This is mysterious. On the one hand, the New Testament tells you to deny your soul and your person. But on the other hand, you still need to act. However, your acting is different from before. Previously when you acted, you yourself were the master. It was you who was the person. Now this person of yours is hung on the cross. It is no longer you as the person but the Lord as the person. &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). To be crucified on the cross is to be brought to the end. Now it is no longer I who live but Christ living in me. Although the person and the life of my soul has been denied, the function of my soul still remains. I still have the mind, the emotion, and the will. It is only the master who controls all these functions who has changed. It is no longer I but Christ who lives.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR THE MEMBERS TO BE COORDINATED</h2><p>Today, you young ones have put yourselves into the Lord&#8217;s hands for the preaching of the gospel in the villages. Is this something that you can do by yourselves? Certainly you cannot do this alone. Do not say that you have the Lord. Just to have the Lord is not enough. You need companions. You need to coordinate with others who are the members of the Body. On the one hand, you are brothers and sisters. On the other hand, you are members one of another.<p>Members cannot be dislocated. Members must be joined together. The joining together is for the coordination. In serving the Lord, not only are we unable to do anything apart from the Lord, but neither can we do anything apart from the members. You need to know that once you are separated from the members, you are separated from the Body. For example, if my hand is separated from my arm, it is separated not only from the arm but from the whole body as well. You only need to be separated from one member, and you are separated from the whole Body. Therefore, your working for the Lord has to be different from that of the worldly ones. They can do things individualistically. But we cannot serve the Lord in an individualistic way. This is because our serving the Lord is the move of the whole Body. We are all members of the Body, and we need to coordinate one with another.<h2 class=head1>THE SECRET OF COORDINATION BEING TO STAY ON THE CROSS AND TO BE WITHOUT OPINIONS</h2><p>What is the secret of coordination? Coordination must be a matter of &#8220;no more I.&#8221; There must no longer be you or I. Once there is you and I, there is no coordination. On the day the gospel teams were sent out, I made an overseas telephone call to talk to them. Since then, although I have not been there with them, news reached me. Praise and thank the Lord! There was much good news. But there was some news that was not as good. Team members have found out that it is not an easy thing to coordinate together. Everyone has opinions. You may argue that man cannot survive without opinion. Yet the strange thing is that the Bible requires us to have no opinion.<p>In Philippians 2:2 Paul says, &#8220;Make my joy full...think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing.&#8221; In other words, to make Paul&#8217;s joy full, the Philippians must not have opinions. However, it is not easy to be without opinions. This morning I will tell you a secret. The best way is to stay on the cross. The best way for two people to work together without any argument, opinion, or long face, is to crucify both on the cross. Thank the Lord. He has already crucified us on the cross!<p>Let me tell you one thing. It is my experience during the last few decades of being involved in the Lord&#8217;s work that both in His work and in His church, there is always a gopher undermining everything. This gopher is ambition. Ambition is the desire to be somebody, to occupy a high position, and to gain a high name. It is the desire for others to say something good about me, for others to consider me as somebody, and for me to take the lead wherever I go. From youth, man loves to compete. He loves to strive to be somebody and to be the first. Often, &#8220;number two&#8221; is jealous of &#8220;number one.&#8221; Even though &#8220;number two&#8221; may be younger in age, he still wants to be somebody and is always aspiring to be the head. I have been observing this matter for more than sixty years. I saw this in mainland China time after time. Since I came overseas, not only have I seen this again, I personally have been in the middle of it as well. I even became the target because of it. I have studied the darts that were thrown at me. To put it simply, all of them have to do with the desire to be somebody, to take the lead, and to occupy a high position. Of course, those who are ambitious would never say it this way. They use very nice speeches and words to cover themselves up. Strictly speaking, they are not trying to attack me. They are only trying to be somebody.<p>What is opinion? Frankly speaking, opinion is just the desire to be somebody. Before the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He was leading a group of disciples, especially Peter, James, John, and Andrew. For three and a half years, they followed the Lord Jesus day after day. If the Lord Jesus went to Galilee, they also went to Galilee. If the Lord Jesus went on the boat, they also went on the boat. Wherever the Lord Jesus went, they went along with Him. If you read the four Gospels, you will discover that they surely had opinions. One time when they went with the Lord Jesus to Jerusalem, He told them clearly on the way that He was going to Jerusalem and that the scribes and the Pharisees would crucify Him on the cross, but that He would resurrect after three days. The Lord repeated this three times, but the disciples did not understand it a bit. Immediately after the Lord Jesus spoke, they began arguing about who should be the first. Today in the Lord&#8217;s work in the church and among the gospel teams, one must remember that there are always problems ahead.<p>When I was young, whenever a brother and a sister were married, they always expected me to say a few words at their wedding. At first, I would always say something nice. After I was forty years old, I did not say anything nice anymore. Although my words were no longer nice, they were true. I still do not believe that it is possible for a couple to have a sweet honeymoon without any argument for more than thirty days. Recently, I heard directly from a brother that he and his wife argued on the third day of their honeymoon. Often when a couple argues, the ultimate contention is whether the woman or the man should have more power. Whose word counts, his or hers? Which one of them should make the decision? I live together with Sister Lee. I like to eat Chinese rolls, but she likes to feed me rice. Whenever rice is served at the table, my eyebrows are raised. But there is no way for me not to eat it. You may ask me what I can do. I can do nothing. There is only the cross. The cross is the way.<h2 class=head1>HAVING NO CONSIDERATION AND KNOWING ONLY TO WORK</h2><p>For example, there may be two jobs in the Lord&#8217;s work that need to be taken care of. One of them is regarded as a great work and the other as small. Do you want to choose the one regarded highly or the one considered lowly? Every one of us should learn not to consider if a work is great or small. We should only take care of the work itself. If you consider, &#8220;Is this work great, or is it small? If I choose the great work, people will think that I am not bearing the cross. I should take the small one instead!&#8221; If you act this way, you are not bearing the cross. You are instead playing politics. Of course, it is not good for you to choose the great work. But if you choose the small one with any motive, the result is just as bad. It is not good for you to have such considerations. You should have no consideration at all.<p>Some people come to me saying, &#8220;Brother Lee, Brother So-and-So is working with us. But he only likes to tell others what to do.&#8221; Let me tell you that the one who likes to tell others what to do has violated the principle of the cross. If he is on the cross, he will not be telling others what to do. However, the one who complains is also not on the cross. If everyone is on the cross, there is no need to tell others what to do. Everyone will just be working. If I do not understand something, you will tell me how to do it. If you do not understand something, I will tell you how to do it. If your intention is to tell others what to do, you are not on the cross. On the other hand, if I complain that you are telling me what to do, I am not on the cross either. If we are on the cross, you may be telling me what to do, and I may be listening to what you say, but neither of us has the feeling that we are bearing the cross. There will be no such thing as telling or not telling others what to do, and there will be no such thing as listening or not listening to what others have to say. Everyone will just know to work.<p>By the Lord&#8217;s mercy, since I entered the Lord&#8217;s work in 1935, I have only known how to work. Spontaneously I was on the cross. It did not mean that there were no problems. It only means that spontaneously there were fewer problems. In the church, in the work, and in our spiritual walk, it is all the same. How can problems be solved? They are solved through the cross. In the family, the husband has to die, and the wife also has to die. If there is no death, there is no life. If there is no death after marriage, there will be arguments every day. There will not be a marriage life. Today, in following the Lord and in working for Him, the secret is nothing less than for you to put yourself on the cross and to remain there.<h2 class=head1>NO PREFERENCE, ONLY OBEDIENCE</h2><p>May the Lord cover me with His blood. The Lord can be my witness. When I was in mainland China, I never tried to start any work anywhere. To me, everywhere was the same. I only received orders. Wherever there was the need, I was sent there. Moreover, wherever there was a place which was hard to work on, I was surely charged to go. I had no preference. After mainland China fell to the Communists, the work assigned me to come to Taiwan. I spoke the northern dialect, but a southern dialect was spoken on the island of Taiwan. Because of this, another brother who knew the southern dialect was assigned to come help me. Three to four months after I arrived, this brother also arrived. After he took a look, he left, saying that he would not come to Taiwan because it was too backward; the roads were all pebbled, and the people all clattered around on wooden clogs.<p>The brothers and sisters who are Taiwan natives have to excuse me for saying this. When we came to Taiwan more than forty years ago, Taipei had but a few roads paved with even blacktop. Most roads were pebbled. It looked very underdeveloped. Even though I was willing to take the cross, sometimes I would lie in the house, staring at the ceiling, wondering why I had come here and what could be done here. Thank and praise the Lord, now I am very happy. To me, the best place to work on the whole earth today is Taiwan.<p>My point is that you must learn to put the &#8220;I&#8221; aside in the Lord&#8217;s work. In other words, you have to be without &#8220;I.&#8221; You should only know to work, to minister, to pray, and to touch the Lord. You should not do anything else. You should not clean the washrooms just for the sake of eventually gaining a name for yourself and for being known as the one who always cleans the washroom. To others this may seem spiritual. But eventually this kind of so-called &#8220;spirituality&#8221; is vanity. When you come, you should do whatever is needed. When the washrooms need cleaning, you clean them. When the podium needs tidying up, you tidy it up. There should not be any preference or special feelings. You should neither strive to speak, nor strive not to speak. When there is the need to speak, you speak. When there is not the need to speak, you do not speak. This is the way of the cross. If the Lord supplies you more, you simply enjoy the Lord&#8217;s provision and remember the needy ones. If the Lord supplies you less, even to the point that you experience poverty, do not murmur. On the whole earth, no servant of the Lord has ever starved to death. No situation should ever bother you, and you should always be without the self. This is the way of the cross.<h2 class=head1>NO AMBITION OR CONSIDERATION BUT ONLY THE CROSS AND RESURRECTION</h2><p>The Chinese say, &#8220;The strength of a horse is tested by the length of the journey, while the heart of man is tested by the passing of time.&#8221; I have been co-working with some brothers for forty to fifty years. There are some others with whom I have worked for twenty to thirty years. Recently, things have happened that made me feel very sorrowful. Among us there has been much talk about the cross. There also has been much talk about resurrection. But when the real situation comes, there is not much of the cross with some of these brothers, and there is not much evidence of resurrection. I hope that with this generation, others may see more of the cross and resurrection, both in our walk and work, as well as in our marriage life. Let me repeat that the way of the cross is the way of putting aside the &#8220;I.&#8221; Hence, in the work there is no ambition. Among us there is no degree, no position, and no name. There is nothing to gain and to covet. Even so, I must say to you that in the work there are still some who have the self. In the work, we should not consider whether or not others treat us well. We should not have such a consideration. I only know how to walk according to the Spirit. Toward everyone, I should be humble, kind, and loving. Toward the work, I only know to be busy and to labor. If others are taking the lead, whatever the arrangements are, I carry them out. There is no feeling, preference, or consideration. This is the way of the cross.<p>The difficulty of the outward circumstances is not worth our mentioning. If there are sufferings, let there be sufferings. Do not have considerations. What does consideration mean? It means that there is ambition. It also means that I must stay on top; I must have it better. To consider is to highly regard the self. I must be number one, number two, number three, and even the last number. Everything is I. What is it to take the way of the cross? It means number one is not I. Number two and number three are not I. Even the last number is not I. Nothing is I. This is to die. If there is no you at all, everything will be well. There will be no problem in suffering. There will be no problems if other brothers and sisters mistreat you or misunderstand you. You will neither mind or consider. This is to take the way of the cross. If you would learn this lesson well and continue on the way of the cross, your work will be effective and full of blessing. This is all I will say this morning. My point can be summarized in one phrase-no more I. For you to go to the villages for the outreach, wherever you may be, let there be only Christ, and no more you. It is now no longer I that live, but Christ who lives.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on March 7, 1989)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE HUMANITY OF ONE WHO SERVES THE LORD</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26; Gal. 2:20; Matt. 5:44; Luke 23:34</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>To be like God-through divinity.</li><li>To be like man-through humanity.</li><li>To have the highest virtues:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Extraordinary love.</li>	<li>Boundless forbearance.</li>	<li>Unparalleled faithfulness.</li>	<li>Absolute humility.</li>	<li>Utmost purity.</li>	<li>Supreme holiness and righteousness.</li>	<li>Brightness and uprightness.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head1>THE HISTORY OF THE LORD&#8217;S LEADING AMONG US</h2><p>This time as I was preparing to come back to Taiwan, I had a deep and strong feeling within me. Based on my experience over the past sixty years in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, I have put a question mark on the matter of a Christian&#8217;s humanity.<p>From the day I was saved, I have not known any worldly friend. Even my relatives are not that frequently in touch with me. For the past sixty years, I have been in contact with only one kind of people, Christians. Furthermore, most of those with whom I have had contact are Christians who love the Lord. But during the course of my contact with them during the past sixty years, what I have seen and experienced has put a question mark in me concerning a Christian&#8217;s humanity.<p>In 1922 I was saved in a little city in northern China. I was also raised up by the Lord there to practice the church life. At that time, I began to learn to speak for the Lord. Later, the Lord led me step by step to move to Shanghai. I was brought into contact with people of all nationalities. All these experiences opened my eyes more and more.<p>In 1949 I came to Taiwan. In 1956 I went to the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia. In 1960 I went further to the West, to the United States and Canada. In the end, I chose the uttermost part of the earth, Los Angeles, as the base of my work. In the years subsequent to that, I passed through Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, London, Denmark, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, India, Thailand, Japan, Guam, Hong Kong, Hawaii, and many other lands and countries. There are now over one thousand churches with about a hundred and fifty thousand saints all over the world. All kinds of peoples are here. I have contacted all types of people, and I have encountered all kinds of situations.<p>Because of this, by the Lord&#8217;s mercy and according to the history of His leading in the past, I feel that I can say something to you concerning the humanity of those who serve the Lord. All the people with whom I have contact are Christians. Many of them are even seeking, loving, and world-forsaking Christians. But among all these people with whom I have contact, many are wrong in their humanity. There is a problem and this bothers me very much. I was therefore brought to further consider two great items of truth: regeneration and transformation.<p>Although there are many Christian groups, I have not heard of any which emphasize regeneration and transformation more than we do. In 1962 when the Lord led me to begin working in America, prayer and the spirit were the first items to which we paid attention. This was how we began. After that, we released many truths concerning transformation and also put out some publications. All this happened twenty years ago. However, in my observation and contact during all these years, a question has been raised within me. How is it that some can be regenerated and transformed and yet still have a problem with their humanity? How is it possible that such a thing could ever happen in the Lord&#8217;s recovery?<h2 class=head1>THE STAGES OF THE LITERATURE WORK IN THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY</h2><p>Up to now, the publication work in the Lord&#8217;s recovery can be divided into two stages. The first stage was during the time of Brother Nee, which was from 1922 to 1952. The second stage began from the publication of the magazine The Ministry of the Word in 1952 until now. During this time, publications of my writings began to appear more and more. Prior to 1952, all the literature work was done by Brother Nee.<p>In 1928 Brother Nee discontinued the publication of his first magazine, The Christian. By 1934 it was resumed. At its resumption I was entrusted with the editorial work. He took up editorship of another magazine of a deeper nature, The Present Testimony. The first few years that I edited The Christian, I spent all the time working on Brother Nee&#8217;s messages. After I was done with most of them, I also put out some of my messages concerning the kingdom.<p>We have to know that the literature work among us was absolutely a personal ministry of Brother Nee. It could not even be considered a work of us co-workers. At that time, I only took a part in the service of it by editing the resumed The Christian magazine. The scope was not wide. Besides me, there was another brother, Brother Yu, who had a part. He paid much attention to the inner life, promoted the writings of the mystics, and did some translations. But on the whole, the Gospel Bookroom then was the literature ministry of Brother Nee.<p>By 1948 there was a great revival among us. The ministry of Brother Nee was recovered. He made fresh arrangements with the literature work of the Gospel Bookroom. Four magazines were simultaneously put out. The deepest of them was The Present Testimony; it was taken up by Brother Nee himself. A simpler one was The Way, in nature quite similar to The Christian, which Brother Nee asked me to take charge of. Other than these two, there were a gospel magazine and another one called The Ministers. This latter one was equivalent to The News of the Churches. I was one of the editors of this magazine also. By then, the scope of the literature work was expanded a little. But within a year&#8217;s time, the Communists took over mainland China, and the literature work was interrupted. I then left the mainland to come to Taiwan.<p>Hence, 1952 was a watershed. The first thirty years were mainly Brother Nee&#8217;s writings. Since 1952 I continued in this ministry with the publication of The Ministry of the Word. By 1963 when I went to the United States, I put out The Stream magazine in America and established the Living Stream Ministry. By 1974 I began to put out the Life-study Messages. Both the number of messages as well as the number of copies printed were big. This is a short history of the literature work.<h2 class=head1>THE DIFFICULTIES AMONG US COMING MAINLY FROM CHRISTIANS</h2><p>I mention the history because for all these years I have contacted mostly co-workers and elders. What bothers me within and gives me difficulty is the humanity of some of them. During the past years, and especially during the first thirty years, I saw this bothering happen to Brother Nee.<p>In 1922 the first church in the Lord&#8217;s recovery was raised up in Brother Nee&#8217;s hometown of Foochow. It was the actual beginning of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. During the subsequent twenty or more years, Brother Nee encountered many sufferings. There were hard times, criticisms, judgments, and attacks. I have seen them coming wave after wave. The few of us co-workers who were close to Brother Nee always felt that he did not seem to have a single day of peace. The storms came one after another. Most of the difficulties came from the Christians and not a few from co-workers and elders.<p>From 1950 on, I began to work overseas. In the beginning I was in Taiwan. Later I moved from Taiwan, passing through East and Southeast Asia and eventually reaching the West. During the past thirty years, I also have encountered many difficulties, and most of them have been from Christians.<p>Brother Nee was not welcomed at that time in mainland China by Christianity. This is because the light that he saw, the way that he took, and the ground that he stood on was not welcomed by Christianity. Hence, some difficulties in the mainland came from Christianity. We are not too concerned about these oppositions. What concerns us is the oppositions that have arisen from among the elders and co-workers in the Lord&#8217;s recovery during the past sixty years.<p>One time fifty years ago, Brother Nee came to me and said, &#8220;Brother Witness, look how even Christians can lie!&#8221; At that time I was quite surprised also. It was hard for me to believe. That was the first alarm I received. Furthermore, the Christian who Brother Nee referred to was not an ordinary Christian. He was a seeking, pursuing Christian. Yet he lied. Since then, the difficulties I encountered were one upon another. They caused great turmoil within me.<h2 class=head1>STUDYING HUMANITY</h2><p>During the past sixty years, I have been observing the Christian humanity. The humanity I am talking about today is not that of an ordinary person but that of a servant of the Lord. It is the humanity of those who are very seeking among us, who have forsaken the world and who love the Lord dearly.<p>The question of humanity touches a deep and wide area. According to my knowledge, the book which speaks about humanity the most is the New Testament. In the New Testament, the person who speaks about humanity the most is Paul. In Paul&#8217;s Epistles, there are many places which speak concerning humanity.<p>Other than this, many countries in the world have philosophies that study humanity. The Chinese Confucianists are considered the best and highest in the study of humanity. The Confucian teaching is so high because of the fact that it takes human ethics as its center. Human ethics can be considered the central thought of humanity. It deals with human relationships such as those between parents and children, brothers, sisters, and friends. Chinese Confucianism is very close to the Bible when it comes to matters of ethics. The only difference is that when the Bible talks about ethics, it has to do with the life of God, while the ethics that the Confucianists talk about have nothing to do with God; there is only a development of humanity. There is no divinity involved. The difference here is very great.<h2 class=head1>MAN HAVING BEEN CREATED ACCORDING TO WHAT GOD IS- LIGHT, LOVE,  HOLINESS, AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Man was created by God. Moreover, when man was created, he was created according to God&#8217;s own image (Gen. 1:26), that is, according to what God is. According to the Bible, the Ten Commandments are a description of God. All laws are descriptions of the lawmakers. The Ten Commandments are the laws made by God. These ten commandments can be represented by four words-light, love, holiness, and righteousness. These are the essence and nature of the Ten Commandments. They are also what the image of God is.<p>The law in the Old Testament is a testimony and a description. When man was created, he was created according to what God is in all these aspects. God is light. Hence, the man whom He created is also light. Although we have been degraded and corrupted, we still desire light. Even a robber aspires to things that are forthright and upright. If he has robbed a bank, he would not like others to know about it. This proves that there is still the element of light in his nature. Furthermore, in our nature there is also love. No one teaches us from youth how we ought to love our brothers and sisters. But we can all love, and we all aspire to love. This love is created by God. This is not all. What God is also includes holiness and righteousness. The Chinese use expressions such as &#8220;brightness and uprightness&#8221; and &#8220;supreme holiness and righteousness&#8221; to describe humanity. All these are revealed in the man whom God created according to what He is.<h2 class=head1>THE HUMANITY OF ONE WHO SERVES THE LORD BEING LIKE GOD-THROUGH DIVINITY</h2><p>The Chinese Confucianists say that &#8220;the way of the Great Learning is in the development of the bright virtue.&#8221; This bright virtue refers to the source of our goodness. It is the function of our conscience. Wang Yang-ming, a philosopher of the &#8220;Li-shue&#8221; school in the Ming Dynasty, expanded the teaching of the &#8220;bright virtue&#8221; to that of the &#8220;function of the conscience.&#8221; To develop and cultivate the function of the conscience is to develop the bright virtue. Although these philosophies are good, they are good only in the human sense; no outside power is added into them. For example, one can push a tram with his own hands. But if electricity is applied to it, the tram will move differently; it will instead be powered by electricity.<p>After much studying, we have to agree with the same words that Paul spoke, &#8220;For to will is present with me, but to do the good is not&#8221; (Rom. 7:18b). We all know that to know is one thing but to do is another. John 3 gives a record of a Pharisee named Nicodemus. He addressed the Lord Jesus as Rabbi, and said to Him, &#8220;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God&#8221; (v. 2). Perhaps he thought that he needed better teachings to improve himself. But the Lord answered him, &#8220;Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&#8221; (v. 3). It seems as if the Lord was telling Nicodemus that after man was created, he had only the image of God. He did not have the life of God, nor did he have the power to do good. Hence, Nicodemus needed to be born anew, that is, he needed to be born of water and the Spirit before he could enter into the kingdom of God (v. 5b). However, Nicodemus still did not understand, and the Lord had to say to him again, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life&#8221; (vv. 14-15). When the Son of Man was crucified on the cross to bear and take away our sins, we were regenerated and received the eternal life. It is the very God who entered into us and mingled with us who produced all the virtues of humanity.<p>True Christian humanity not only comprises the divine attributes that fill us within; it also comprises the attributes that we received at creation. At the time man was created, he had only the image of God&#8217;s attributes; he did not have the content and reality of these attributes. This is why we all have to receive this God of creation into us to be our content. When He fills us, we can truly love Him. This is not to live ourselves but to live Him. It comes out of divinity and is expressed through humanity. This is the humanity a Christian should have.<p>However, many times, we do not see ourselves or others living the proper humanity. On the contrary, sometimes there appears to be a deep degradation. I have been bothered before by this. The answer I have is the illustration of the grafting of a tree. After a branch is grafted, what comes forth from the original tree are still the original fruits. Only those which come out of the grafted branch are the desired fruits. If there is no divinity in our humanity, what is lived out will only be our oldness. Hence, we have to know that as Christians we do not live a life of one attribute. Rather we must live a &#8220;double&#8221; life of two attributes. There must be the divine attribute, and there must be the human attribute. Only this will guarantee us a proper kind of humanity.<p>In the New Testament, Paul said, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). It is true that Christ is living today; but we have to know that He lives within us. He is living Himself out from within us. This is what the Gospel of Luke reveals to us. The divine attributes of God are expressed through the human virtues of man. The divine nature is mingled with the human nature. The divine nature is the source and the content, and the human nature is the expression and the form. This is what we mean by humanity. We can also call it morality or virtue. It is a kind of character of a Christian and is something that every servant of the Lord should have.<h2 class=head1>THE HUMANITY OF ONE WHO SERVES THE LORD BEING HUMAN-THROUGH THE PROPER HUMAN NATURE</h2><p>To be human is to take the proper way of a man. It is to have the proper moral ethic. The humanity of one who serves the Lord must be: 1) a coming forth of God and 2) fully human, that is, it must have the proper human flavor. If there is no human flavor, at best it will be like an angel, and at worst, it will be like a demon. For us to serve the Lord, we must not be like angels or demons. We have to be human, we must be like a man. If we go to the villages for the gospel outreach, and we give others the impression that we are like angels, I am afraid no one would dare to come close to us. Hence, we need to be human. This also is a part of our humanity.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR THE EXCELLENT VIRTUES IN SERVING THE LORD</h2><p>The highest morality is one in which divinity is added to our humanity. This is the divine attributes of God expressed in the created virtues of man. It is also the most excellent virtue. According to our understanding of the Bible and our personal experience, there are seven items of these excellent virtues.<h2 class=head2>Extraordinary Love</h2><p>Love is the first item of these excellent virtues. This love is extraordinary. We can love to an extent that we even love our enemies (Matt. 5:44).<h2 class=head2>Boundless Forbearance</h2><p>To forbear is to forgive. When we forgive, our hearts have to be boundless. A narrow person cannot forgive. Hence, we need to have a boundless forbearance. We have to forbear to an extent that we can forgive our enemies and those who hate us.<p>According to our experience, it is easier to love our enemies than to forgive them. Sometimes we can love others but cannot forgive them. For example, I can love you, but I may not be able to forget that you have offended me. Because I love you, even though you are my enemy, I can give you a Bible. But it is very difficult for me to forget the offense that you have done to me. Hence, it is not easy to forgive. For this reason, the Lord set a good example for us in the Gospels. Although men reviled Him unceasingly while He was on earth, His last act on earth before He died was a prayer for man, &#8220;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing&#8221; (Luke 23:34a). This is boundless forbearance.<h2 class=head2>    Unparalleled Faithfulness</h2><p>We have to deal with others with consistency and in faithfulness. We should not betray others or the Lord. There must be unparalleled faithfulness.<h2 class=head2>Absolute Humility</h2><p>Our humility has to be absolute. Not only do we have to be humble. We have to be in humiliation. To be humble is to be low, but to be humiliated is to be made small. To serve the Lord we need an absolute humility.<h2 class=head2>Utmost Purity</h2><p>Not only do we have to be clean. We have to be pure as well. And this purity must be to the utmost.<h2 class=head2>Supreme Holiness and Righteousness</h2><p>Towards God we have to be supremely holy, and towards man we have to be supremely righteous. Towards God we have to be fully separated, and toward man, we have to be fully proper, with no fault whatsoever. This is supreme holiness and righteousness.<h2 class=head2>Brightness and Uprightness</h2><p>The first item is love, and the last item is light. The brightness to which we refer here is different from the brightness the world talks about. Here we mean light. We have to walk in light. Everything we do must be in the light and must not be in darkness. We must be thoroughly upright and forthright, and must not be narrow-minded or suspicious in any way.<p>All the seven items combined give a proper humanity for a servant of the Lord.<p>In conclusion, the Christian humanity is a life lived out through the mingling of the divine attributes and the created human morality. May the Lord preserve us to serve Him all the days of our life, without turning back or deviating. May we all live out the proper humanity of one who serves the Lord. The Lord be merciful to us all.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on March 14, 1989)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE HUMANITY OF ONE WHO SERVES THE LORD</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:9; 4:8, 9, 11-13</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>To be like God-through divinity.</li><li>To be like man-through humanity.</li><li>To have the highest virtues:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Extraordinary love.</li>	<li>Boundless forbearance.</li>	<li>Unparalleled faithfulness.</li>	<li>Absolute humility.</li>	<li>Utmost purity.</li>	<li>Supreme holiness and righteousness.</li>	<li>Brightness and uprightness.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Lord Jesus, we love You, and we treasure Your word. Lead us into Your word. Let us meet, touch, enjoy, and gain You in it. Be with us again this morning in this meeting. We pray that You will open Yourself to us so that every day we can pick up what You want us to learn here. We want to be like Paul who said that he had learned the secret. O Lord, remember us, and remember these young brothers and sisters that they would learn this secret from their youth, which is to be able to do everything in Him who empowers us. May all that is spoken in Philippians 4 be lived out in us. O Lord, build us up! Build up our character and our humanity, which is just Yourself. We pray that Your blood will cleanse and cover us again. Amen!<h2 class=head1>EXPLANATION OF HUMANITY</h2><p>We have to consider again the humanity of one who serves the Lord. The word ren-ger in Chinese, which we translate as humanity, is a word that is hard to define. The definitions vary according to different dictionaries and lexicons; there are different explanations of the word. According to what I know, there is even a legal definition of the word; it refers to a man&#8217;s position and rights. Legally speaking, to lose one&#8217;s ren-ger, or humanity, is to lose his position and rights as a human being. Of course, this is a very serious matter.<p>According to my experience and observation, humanity refers to what a person is. This intrinsic being of a person eventually becomes a form that expresses itself before men. It is not easy to find an equivalent word for ren-ger in English. The closest word may be personality. But this word only refers to the character of a person. This is still somewhat different from what a person is. Humanity emphasizes the outward expression; &#8220;personality&#8221; emphasizes the inward nature. Usually, whatever is within a man is expressed outwardly in a certain way or form. Therefore these two aspects are very close. One is inward and the other is outward. Inwardly it is the personality and outwardly it is the humanity.<h2 class=head1>THE HUMANITY OF ONE WHO SERVES THE LORD BEING FOUND BY OTHERS TO BE IN CHRIST</h2><p>Philippians 3:9 says, &#8220;And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law.&#8221; The Chinese Union Version renders the first part of this verse, &#8220;And being in Him.&#8221; There is a big difference between being found in Him and being in Him. To be &#8220;in Him&#8221; does not involve the matter of humanity; it only expresses a fact and a hope. The proper translation is to &#8220;be found in Him.&#8221; To &#8220;be found in Him&#8221; has to do with our humanity.<p>Our humanity should be Christ. Christ should be my form as a man. Others should see a form in me. This form is Christ. Christ should be my humanity.<p>In Philippians 1 Paul said, &#8220;As always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&#8221; (v. 20b). Paul did not care for life or death. He always magnified Christ in his body. This magnification is a form. This form can be likened to the squares in the exercise book which we used for practicing Chinese penmanship when we were young. The teacher would write the characters properly in the top squares first. The students would then copy the words in the other squares. There was a form there; one could not write randomly. Today, we also have a square around us, which is Christ.<h2 class=head1>BEING IN CHRIST AND MAGNIFYING CHRIST AS ALWAYS</h2><p>The humanity that we are speaking of here is different from the humanity taught by the Chinese Confucianists. We both speak concerning humanity, but the elements of the two speakings are different and the natures are not the same. The Confucianists&#8217; nature at best is but bronze. But our nature is gold. Take a pocket watch as an example. We may all have a pocket watch, but your watch is bronze or steel while mine is gold. They are all watches, but they are not the same kind of watch. The difference is in their nature and element. We have to see this.<p>The Christian humanity does not refer to our natural virtues; rather, it is the Christ who lives in us and out of us. According to Philippians, we are people in Christ. From the day we were saved, we have been transferred from Adam into Christ. According to the parable of the sower in Matthew 13, the Lord sowed Himself into us. However, 1 Corinthians 3 considers our salvation as a kind of planting (v. 6); we have been planted into Christ. On the one hand, it is Christ growing in us. Our hearts are like the soil; they are for growing Christ. On the other hand, it is of God that we are in Christ Jesus (1:30). It is God who has translated us from Adam into Christ. Today our position is in Christ. However, we have to attain to a condition in which we are found in Christ. Moreover, whether by life or death, Christ should be magnified in our body as always. This is the Christian humanity.<h2 class=head1>OUR OLD CREATION CAUSING PROBLEMS TO OUR HUMANITY</h2><p>Over the past sixty years, I have seen much that has happened. In the first thirty years, I saw things happening to Brother Nee personally. In the second thirty years, I experienced them myself. We both realized that though some Christians did love the Lord and eventually, became co-workers and elders, after a period of time they changed, and their humanity became a problem. One could no longer see any love, forgiveness, or faithfulness. There was no humility and purity. On the contrary, we saw lying. This is an undeniable fact. More than twenty years ago, a co-worker wrote a letter to me which was filled with good words and was totally positive. But after three days, another letter was sent to me from Manila; it was a copy of a letter which this same brother had written. The content of that letter was totally negative. May the Lord&#8217;s blood cover me in saying this. This matter has affected me very much and has rendered me great help.<p>In 1962 when I first arrived in the United States, the messages released during the first one or two years were all on transformation. Transformation is a kind of metabolism. When you add one element to another, the substance will be transformed. Before we were saved, we only had improvements. Once we are saved, the heavenly chemical element, which is the Lord Jesus, is added into us. From that time on, we have another constituent in us, and we begin gradually to be transformed.<p>We are transformed from being in Christ to being found in Christ. This is like what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12, that he was then only a man in Christ (v. 2). But in Philippians 3 he said that he would like to be found in Christ (v. 9). When we were saved, we had the Lord&#8217;s mercy and grace to consecrate ourselves fully to the Lord and to love Him in a pure way. At that time, surely we were in Christ, living out Christ, and found by others to be in Christ. But after many years, due to positions, private interests, and other situations, we became disturbed; as such, we could no longer live in Christ and were no longer magnifying Christ.<p>We have to see that it is only when the Lord returns and our bodies are redeemed that we can be totally free from the old creation. Otherwise, a certain part of our being still remains in the old creation. This is the part of the old creation that gives problems to our humanity.<h2 class=head1>THE BETTER BRANCH GRAFTED TO THE POOR TREE PRODUCING TWO KINDS OF FRUITS</h2><p>We can describe the relationship between the Lord and us by grafting. Hymns, #482, verse 3, says,<p class=hbody>This the secret nature hideth, Harvest grows from buried grain; A poor tree with better grafted, Richer, sweeter life doth gain.<p>Grafting in the Bible is the grafting of a better branch to a poor tree. Christ is the better Branch and we are the poor tree. This poor tree grows up to the spot where the grafting occurred; the life element of the better Branch comes in; and whatever grows from the better Branch is good. However, whatever grows from parts other than the better Branch is still poor.<p>We can illustrate this by the life of a married couple. Early in the morning, the husband rises up to touch the Lord, to pray, and to read the Bible. He is bearing good fruits now. He comes out of his study and it is past breakfast time. He sees that his wife is unhappy and her countenance has changed. This disturbance takes away all of the husband&#8217;s revivals of the morning, and he also begins to speak with a changed countenance. Five minutes ago, he was in the heavens. But now, five minutes later, he has fallen down to the earth. This kind of experience happens to us all the time.<p>We have to see that the two trees in the garden of Eden are both in us. One is the tree of life and the other is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When the husband touches the Lord in the morning and is revived, he is eating of the tree of life. At breakfast time, when he loses his temper with his wife, he switches from the tree of life to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. At the office during lunch time, the husband calms himself down and considers. He begins to regret the manner in which he spoke to his wife, and determines not to do the same thing next time. He will be patient and will not lose his temper anymore. This is neither the evil aspect of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, nor the tree of life; he is but striving to improve himself in the good aspect of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. All these speak of our real condition.<p>Therefore, if we want to have the proper humanity, we have to allow the better Branch, Christ, to be grafted to us, the poor tree, so that we can grow up and produce good fruits through the joint of grafting.<h2 class=head1>EXAMPLES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class=head2>Demas Having Loved the Present Age and Forsaken Paul</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 4, Paul mentioned the names of two brothers. The first one was Demas. He said, &#8220;Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age, and has gone to Thessalonica&#8221; (v. 10). Demas was a co-worker of Paul. Paul would not have chosen a co-worker easily. Demas was chosen to be a co-worker, but he changed afterwards. We believe that this change was caused by Paul&#8217;s circumstance. At the beginning, Demas had also loved the Lord and consecrated himself to Him. He worked with Paul and was like the poor tree yielding good fruits. But after he saw Paul being attacked, arrested, sent off to Rome, judged by Caesar, and jailed for over a year or two without release, he could not overcome this pitiful situation and began to love the age. By then he was the poor tree yielding poor fruits again. He was affected by the outward circumstances.<h2 class=head2>Alexander Doing Many Evil Things to Paul</h2><p>Besides this, there was another name, Alexander. Paul mentioned in 2 Timothy 4 that &#8220;Alexander...did many evil things to me&#8221; (v. 14). If he did many evil things to Paul, this proves that he had been in touch with Paul. If Alexander had not known Paul and had had no dealings with Paul, he would not have persecuted Paul. This is like two persons who if they are never married will never have a divorce. A husband and a wife can divorce each other because they are married. Alexander may have been saved and may have been a brother, but he did evil things to persecute the Lord&#8217;s servant. Not only are such things recorded in the Bible, I have also seen similar things happening among the brothers.<p>Today you are all being trained in the Full-time Training Center. Daily you exercise your spirit and live a heavenly life. But if one day a brother or a sister offends you and wrongly accuses you, are you going to leave the Training Center? We have to see that today we still have the corrupted nature of the old creation within us; we are not yet totally free from it. This is like a beautiful butterfly which has changed from a hairy caterpillar. The beautiful butterfly will never revert back to the ugly movements of the caterpillar. However, while it is still the hairy caterpillar, ugly movements can still be seen. All these illustrations warn us that the old creation is still with us. If we are not in Christ, we are in the old creation, and our old creation will cause problems to our humanity.<h2 class=head1>GOD REGULATING MAN THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY AND THE INWARD CONSCIENCE</h2><p>We have to know that the old creation and the natural life within us can do many things. If there were no laws in the country, we could even rob banks. Today, God sovereignly puts nations and rulers on earth. Romans 13 says, &#8220;Let every person be subject to the authorities over them. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are appointed by God&#8221; (v. 1). All rulers govern for God to maintain the world situation. If there were no law courts, governments, or police stations on earth, we would not be able to live and work peacefully.<p>In addition, God has created a conscience within man. The conscience controls our walk and conduct. Moreover, we the saved ones have God added to our conscience. The conscience forms a part of man&#8217;s spirit. Since God lives in our spirit, He lives in our conscience. However, God does not use brute force to rule over this part of us. Rather, He draws us with His love. We see this in the Lord&#8217;s question to Peter, &#8220;Do you love Me?&#8221; Peter answered, &#8220;Yes, Lord, You know that I love You.&#8221; The Lord said to him, &#8220;Shepherd My sheep&#8221; (John 21:16). This is His drawing us with His love. If we do not love the Lord, we lose the restraint that comes from this kind of attraction and are liable to do anything and everything.<h2 class=head1>HUMANITY BEING SAFEGUARDED THROUGH LOVING THE LORD</h2><p>For a Christian to serve the Lord, he must have the humanity of a servant of the Lord. We do not have to wait for the government, the law court, or the policeman to regulate us. Neither should we merely be regulated by our conscience. Our humanity comes from our loving of our God. We have been planted in Him. Now we are willing to live in Him and are willing to be found by others to be a person in Him. Furthermore, what we live out is just Christ. We always allow Christ to be magnified in our body. No matter what kind of circumstance, whether it be poverty, riches, suffering, enjoyment, peace, danger, or even death, I magnify Him. In this way, He becomes my humanity.<p>However, such a high humanity can be lost. One can degenerate from a noble humanity to a base one, giving up one&#8217;s position and rights as a man. It is possible for Christians to degrade to such an extent. This is like Alexander; he did not have a proper humanity. He would even do many evil things to a servant of the Lord who loved and served Him. Likewise, Demas loved the present age and forsook Paul.<p>Today, we should be those who are willing to remain in Christ and be found in Him. In this way, we can do all things in Him who empowers us (Phil. 4:13). Every one of the six virtues-that which is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of (v. 8)-is hard to achieve from man&#8217;s point of view. But we can do all these in Him who empowers us. In this way, we live out godliness and the proper humanity, which is just Christ manifested in our bodies and lived out through us.<p>Hence, we should not think that as Christians our humanity is safeguarded. Whether our humanity will be safeguarded or not depends on whether or not we continue to love the Lord and consecrate ourselves. This is why the new way is helping us to be revived every morning and to overcome every day. Such a living will keep us in the proper condition. Otherwise, it will be impossible for us to live out the normal, proper humanity.<p>In February of this year I visited the churches near San Francisco. A brother there asked me if I, as one having been in the Lord for so many years and with such a vast area and heavy burden in the work, had ever had any trouble. I replied that certainly there are many troubles. The brother then asked me if I have peace within. I replied that though troubles are many, the peace is even more. This is because the work is not my business but the Lord&#8217;s business. It is the same with the preaching of the gospel. It is the Lord&#8217;s business whether a person will be saved or not. It is our duty to preach the gospel. If others accept it, they will receive grace. If they reject it, they will miss the grace. For me, I am not troubled at all. This is something that we need to know.<h2 class=head1>STANDING FIRM IN CHRIST AND NOT FEARING THE WAVES</h2><p>We have to see today that first we have to be equipped with such a humanity. Only then are we qualified to serve the Lord. Once we lose this humanity, we do not have the position and the right to serve the Lord. Second, I know that you are still young. I am at least sixty years ahead of you. I am very familiar with this way, but you have a long way yet to go. There are many difficulties along the way. &#8220;God hath not promised skies always blue, Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through&#8221; (Hymns, #720). For this reason, by grace you have to stand firm in Christ, maintaining this life through holding Christ as the humanity. When you see a storm, do not listen to rumors and do not be affected by those who have changed. Do not ask why. When a man is changed, he is changed, and that is all. We have to look to the Lord&#8217;s mercy today to keep us unchanged and to preserve us all the way to the end.<p>Mark 4 describes the Lord Jesus sitting in the boat with His disciples as they crossed over to the other side. Suddenly a great windstorm came, and the waves beat into the boat so that the boat was filling up. The disciples were very afraid, but Jesus was sleeping on the cushion in the stern (vv. 37, 38). The stern of a small boat is the part that is most easily swayed. Although the swaying was severe, the Lord still had a peaceful sleep.<p>May the Lord&#8217;s blood cover me. I have the same sensation today. There may be windstorms. But I can still sleep in the stern. I hope that you also can be like this. You should know that even with such a short trip as the journey across the Sea of Galilee, there were still frequent windstorms and high waves.<p>Paul said in 2 Timothy 1 that all those in Asia had turned away from him (v. 15). Chapter four also shows us that Demas had forsaken Paul (v. 10). Moreover, Alexander did many evil things to Paul (v. 14). It seems that there was no one there who was one with Paul. But thank the Lord, there was still Timothy who was one with him. That is why in 2 Timothy Paul did not show any discouragement. Rather, he was singing the victory song. He said, &#8220;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; henceforth, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved His appearing&#8221; (vv. 7-8). If we love His appearing, we will be kept in the realm of having Christ as our humanity. When He returns, we shall surely be rewarded.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on March 16, 1989)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE POWER OF RESURRECTION AND THE CONFORMATION TO THE CROSS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19; 2:12-16; 3:9-10; 4:8, 12-13</h1><p>In this message we will look specifically at the power of resurrection and the conformation to the cross. We all know that Philippians is a book that speaks specifically about the experience of Christ. As such, it is a book of experience. The truths contained in it are very deep, but these truths are expressed to us in experience. This book has four chapters, and we have quoted some verses from every chapter. These verses are the very essence of this book. It is only after we get into these verses that we can say we know the book of Philippians.<h2 class=head1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT FOR OUR MAGNIFYING OF CHRIST</h2><p>Philippians 1:19 says, &#8220;This shall turn out to salvation through...the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&#8221; Salvation here does not refer to the deliverance from God&#8217;s punishment or from future perdition. Salvation here refers to that which was spoken of in verses 20 and 21. We are to be saved to the extent that &#8220;Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.&#8221; Hence, the salvation in Philippians is not just a matter of living out Christ, but a matter of magnifying Christ in our bodies.<p>In His humanity, Christ passed through the experiences of incarnation and human living, eventually being crucified on the cross. All these processes are very insignificant in man&#8217;s eyes. Even today, while the gospel is preached throughout the whole earth, man still feels the same way. When Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was imprisoned in Rome (Phil. 1:13) during the reign of the Roman Caesar. The people then, especially those in the house of Caesar, thought very little of Jesus. Although Paul as a prisoner suffered much and experienced great difficulties, even to the point that he could have been executed the very next day, he was bold to experience Christ and to magnify Christ by life or by death before Caesar and all those around him. As a result, Paul&#8217;s magnifying of Christ brought even some in the household of Caesar to salvation through believing into Christ.<p>Had Paul not magnified Christ while he was being interrogated and persecuted in prison, it would have meant that he was not saved in that circumstance. It is not an easy matter to be saved in your environment when you are in prison. This can never be achieved by yourself. How can you be saved? It is by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that you can magnify Christ whether through life or through death.<p>We can see from history and from biographies that when martyrs die, they receive a special power from on high. I can never forget a story I heard fifty years ago. One day, in northern China where my hometown was, I met a brother. He was formerly a merchant. Later he gave up his career to become a traveling evangelist. I asked him on that day how he was saved. He told me the following story.<p>At the end of the Ching Dynasty, there was the Boxer Rebellion in China. Eight nations joined forces to wage war on Peking. Many Christians were persecuted and even died for the Lord during the riots. At that time, this man was an apprentice in a shop in Peking. One day, the Boxers were parading on the streets, sending Christians to the execution ground. They shouted and cried with their swords in their hands. The scene was frightening. All the households, including the shops, were closed. Out of curiosity he peeped out of the crack between the closed door. He saw that among the parading line, there was a very young Christian girl about twenty years old. She was on her way to be executed. Although the Boxers around her were very fierce, this sister was able to sing and praise with overflowing joy on the cart bound for the execution ground. This not only shocked him, but touched him to the uttermost. He was determined to investigate thoroughly the Christian religion as soon as the Boxer rebellion was over, to find out from where the girl derived her strength. Not long after his search, he believed in the Lord and decided to no longer be in business. He became instead an evangelist. This was the result of the girl&#8217;s magnifying of Christ in the face of execution.<p>In the province of Kiangsi at the time of the Communist turmoil, many Christians also were martyred. One Western missionary was caught and spoke one famous sentence as he was about to die: &#8220;The face of every martyr shines like the face of an angel.&#8221; This shows us that the Christ experienced in Philippians brings us to the point that we can become a martyr. We know that there is no suffering more severe than to be martyred. This is the most difficult thing for anyone to do. This is why Paul said that it was through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that he could magnify Christ whether through life or through death.<h2 class=head1>SUBMITTING TO GOD TO TAKE THE NARROW WAY OF THE CROSS</h2><p>In Philippians 2 Paul mentions submission many times. To be submissive is to agree with whatever God says. In the chorus of #481 in Hymns, Brother A. B. Simpson wrote &#8220;All the way to Calvary.&#8221; This is the Lord&#8217;s ordination and commandment for us. Since the Lord died on the cross, we also should take the narrow way of the cross. The Christian life is, on the one hand, to live daily. On the other hand, it is to die daily. The life between a husband and a wife is a &#8220;martyr&#8217;s&#8221; life. Daily the wife slaughters the husband, and the husband the wife. If you have been living wholly and proudly without having others slaughter you, you are a defeated Christian. You must be a &#8220;martyred&#8221; Christian not just before the Roman Caesar, but before your husband or your wife. In other words, let your husband or wife slaughter you and terminate you.<p>Today, you are living in the Training Center. Every dormitory room is a slaughterhouse. We know that in the Old Testament, the first step in the offering of a burnt offering is the killing of the sacrifice. Then there has to be the skinning, the cutting to pieces, and finally, the laying of the sacrifice on the altar to be burnt to ashes. Only then will the sacrifice be accepted, and only then will the sacrifice be considered complete. The result of the burnt offering is a pile of ashes. Today when I come to your dormitory, and I do not see ashes, it means that you are not yet &#8220;martyred,&#8221; that you have not been &#8220;slaughtered,&#8221; and that you have not been burnt to ashes. You have not yet taken the narrow way of the cross.<p>In Philippians 2:17 Paul said, &#8220;But if even I am poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice together with you all.&#8221; Paul added to the faith of the Philippians the drink offering. This was to encourage the Philippians that though they had difficulties and sufferings for the sake of believing in the Lord, Paul&#8217;s suffering in his prison was even more than theirs. It was as if they were the burnt offerings, and he was the drink offering on top of the burnt offerings. This is what it means to be martyred. Actually, before Paul was martyred, he had been martyred already. In his feeling, he was daily slaughtered, he was daily martyred.<p>However, we must see that this kind of martyrdom is salvation. If the ones who are living together among you always win and never are slaughtered, then you are all failures. If you are continually being slaughtered, it seems that you are being dealt with and terminated by others. It seems that you are defeated. But actually you are being saved.<p>Today, the divorce rate in the United States is quite high. Many people remarry, even two or three times, or even more. We have to realize that husbands and wives separate from each other because neither one would sacrifice. The word sacrifice in Chinese is very meaningful. It has as its root the word bull. This shows that it is a bull or a goat that is being used as a sacrifice. When the animal is put to death, the result is a sacrifice. This is the way of the cross.<h2 class=head1>OBEDIENT UNTO DEATH FOR THE WORKING OUT OF OUR SALVATION</h2><p>Today, our marriage life, family life, and church life are all a &#8220;slaughtering&#8221; life. Not only do we have to be saved through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, but we have to obey God as well and to learn to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. Paul said in Philippians 2, &#8220;So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only as in my presence, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&#8221; (v. 12). The word &#8220;salvation&#8221; here is the same as the one used in chapter one. In the original language, the word &#8220;work out&#8221; has the meaning of living out. In other words, Paul hoped that the Philippians would live out their salvation.<p>We have to see that today our living is our working. When you live out your salvation, you are working out your salvation. When the Lord Jesus is in you, He is your salvation. But He has not been lived out as your outward salvation. For example, while you are having your dinner at the Training Center, a sister at the same table may have said something that hurt you very much. You may not have tried to explain anything. You may have forced yourself to be patient and to finish your meal. But after the meal, you would go to a place where no one could see you and then you would cry yourself out. After you cry, you may still act ostensibly as if nothing has happened. This shows that you have not lived out your salvation. Instead you live out your &#8220;hypocrisy.&#8221;<p>Hence, living out our salvation, that is, working out our salvation, is a great spiritual work. In the hymn by Simpson, he said that we are &#8220;to His death conformed to be&#8221; (Hymns, #481). This is the condition for working out our salvation. To work out our salvation, we have to be obedient unto death and remain in death. We have to be obedient to the portion that God has given us. This is to die. If we do not die, we are not being obedient. When a difficult situation arises, we have to say, &#8220;Praise the Lord!&#8221; We have to realize that it is prepared for us by the Lord. We have to work out our salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<p>In 2:13 Paul continued on to say, &#8220;For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&#8221; The God mentioned here is the Spirit of Jesus Christ in chapter one. He is also the Spirit with the bountiful supply, operating within us that we would accomplish His good pleasure, which is to live out our salvation. Today we are not saved by work. We are saved by the Spirit who operates within us. It is by the bountiful supply of our God that we can obey God&#8217;s ordination.<p>God&#8217;s ordination for us today and His measure for us in all the environments is death. This is true in our marriage life. It is also true in our bearing and raising up of children. The more our self dies, the more we overcome and are spiritual, and can work out our salvation.<h2 class=head1>WITHOUT MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS, HOLDING FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE</h2><p>In Philippians 2:14 Paul said, &#8220;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.&#8221; Although murmurings and reasonings are two small things, they are two real problems. There is hardly a couple which has no murmuring or reasoning between them. We have also seen that murmuring is from the emotion and comes mostly from the sisters. Reasoning is from the mind and comes mostly from the brothers. Problems in our family life arise frequently from the sisters opening up their mouths first. Once they open their mouths, murmurings come out. When the brothers answer, they often get into reasonings. Perhaps your life in the Training Center is not much different. But whenever we have murmurings and reasonings, we have not worked out our salvation.<p>Hence, Paul said in verses 15 and 16, &#8220;You shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.&#8221; We the saved ones are the luminaries. We are qualified to reflect the divine light of Christ and to hold forth and demonstrate to others the word of life. To hold forth the word of God&#8217;s life is also a part of our salvation.<p>Philippians 1 tells us that to be saved is to magnify Christ. In chapter two, to be saved is to live out salvation and to hold forth the word of life. In chapter three, to be saved is to be found in Christ (v. 9). If we murmur or reason, others will not find us in Christ. We have to realize that the way God ordains for Christians is the way of salvation which is also the way of expressing and magnifying Christ. The key to all these experiences is the death of our self. When that happens, others will see that we are a person in Christ. The righteousness in us will not be the result of our keeping the law. Rather, it will be through faith and based on God&#8217;s righteousness (v. 9). This is to be saved. This is also to magnify Christ and to live out salvation.<h2 class=head1>THE POWER OF RESURRECTION AND THE CONFORMATION TO THE CROSS</h2><p>In Philippians 3:10 Paul continued on to say, &#8220;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&#8221; In this passage, we see further the secret to experiencing Christ. One of the secrets is the power of resurrection. The other is the conformation to His death, which is the conformation to His cross. Stanza one of #631 in Hymns says, &#8220;If I&#8217;d know Christ&#8217;s risen power, I must ever love the Cross.&#8221; The power of resurrection is our riches. If you are a rich man, you will spend your money gladly. To be conformed to the cross is the way our riches are spent. This passage tells us the experience of Paul. It shows us that if we do not know the power of resurrection and do not live in resurrection, there is no way for us to die by ourselves. It is the power of resurrection that bears us on to death and that takes us on the way of the cross.<p>Today the reality of Christ&#8217;s resurrection is the Holy Spirit. When you live in the Spirit, you live in the reality of resurrection. The last stanza of #631 in Hymns says, &#8220;If God thru th&#8217; Eternal Spirit nail me ever with the Lord.&#8221; It is the Spirit who nails you. Hence, it is not your colleagues or your husband or wife who is dealing with you. Rather, it is the Holy Spirit in you who is taking you on in the experience of the Lord&#8217;s death, so that you can be conformed to His death. Therefore, the conformation to the cross comes about through the power of resurrection.<p>This is why we must learn to exercise our spirit, experience the Spirit, and receive the killing of the cross. If we would not receive the cross, but would only exercise our spirit, this experience of the spirit would not be reliable. The result of a true exercise of the spirit will surely cause us to die and to be crucified. The cross and the Holy Spirit go together. The two also follow one another. On the one hand, we must receive the cross before the Holy Spirit will fill us up. On the other hand, we must be full of the power of the Holy Spirit before we can receive the cross. The two complement each other. From Philippians 3:10 we see that the power of resurrection is the Spirit, and the conformation to the cross is death. This is the secret to our experience of Christ.<h2 class=head1>LIVING AN UPLIFTED HUMANITY IN THE ONE WHO EMPOWERS ME</h2><p>By the end of Philippians, Paul was full of wisdom and mentioned six virtues: &#8220;Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of&#8221; (4:8). These six items are the proper humanity of a Christian. But all of these virtues can be achieved only through the cross. Hence, Paul went on to say, &#8220;In everything and in all things I have learned the secret... I can do all things in Him who empowers me&#8221; (vv. 12-13). The secret here is the experience of death and resurrection. We are conformed to the cross by the power of resurrection. We live out salvation by the God who operates within, and we live out the likeness of His death, that is, we magnify Christ, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit.<p>We have to see that this kind of experience of Christ is totally different from the cultivation [of the bright virtue] taught by the Chinese Confucianist. No matter how much the Confucianists improve themselves, they have no resurrection power within, which is the Spirit with the bountiful supply. They can only develop the conscience that is within them by nature. However, this is quite limited. For us, we are obeying the God who operates within us. Our conscience and inner sensation is the Spirit with the bountiful supply. When we experience the Spirit day by day, we live out a life with an uplifted humanity.<p>Paul used the highest and topmost expressions within this short Epistle to the Philippians: the bountiful supply of the Spirit, the God who operates, the power of resurrection, and the Christ who empowers us. They are used to show the Philippians how to experience Christ. A servant of the Lord must be familiar with these truths. At the same time, we have to see that this is the humanity we who serve the Lord should have. Our humanity is the expression of the work of the Triune God in us. As far as the Spirit is concerned, He is the bountiful supply. As far as the Father is concerned, He is the operating God. As far as the Son is concerned, He is the One who empowers me. In the end, the Triune God becomes my power within in resurrection. I am being conformed to His death through this power.<p>This operating God, bountifully supplying Spirit, and empowering Christ work in me continually. In the end, the Triune God becomes in me the resurrected One, supplying me daily with the resurrection power. If I live by this power, I will surely love the conformation to the cross. In the end, salvation is lived out, and Christ is magnified in me. I will have the highest humanity, and whatever is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of will be found in me.<p>Although the book of Philippians is a short book, I hope that you would fellowship about it in depth. Not only should you learn these truths, you have to get into the light revealed in these truths, so that from your youth, you would build up a proper humanity and would even be able to possess the highest humanity.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on March 21, 1989)</body></html>
