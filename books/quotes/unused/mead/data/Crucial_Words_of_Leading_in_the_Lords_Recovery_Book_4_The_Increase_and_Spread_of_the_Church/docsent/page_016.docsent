   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STUDYING TO IMPROVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ORDER TO HAVE REMAINING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Over the last sixty years, it has been our practice for the Lord s table to be a joint meeting on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we must study how to conduct the Lord s table meeting in order to keep the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s table meeting is the most important meeting of the church, and it is highly regarded by all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some saints truly feel sorry when they cannot attend the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, it is worthwhile to study how we should meet in order to break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consider a sister who has not been to a meeting for a long time but still longs for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every time she passes the meeting hall, she feels comforted, but she is hesitant to go in because of time constraints, the condition of her health, or responsibilities related to her children or job.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must empathize with her situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Breaking bread once a week on the Lord s Day in a joint meeting at the meeting hall is not required by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In fact, Acts 2:46 shows that the believers in the early days broke bread day by day...from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the grammar of this verse, the breaking of bread was not in the temple but rather in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Going to the temple was like going to a big meeting, and gathering in homes was like a small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A big joint meeting is not possible in homes, because no home can accommodate all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the early church the believers broke bread in small group gatherings, and they broke bread daily.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, the bread-breaking meeting does not necessarily have to be held jointly at a meeting hall on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It would probably not be easy to change immediately, but we can gradually make a change by meeting every other week at the meeting hall and in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some saints will gain more supply when the breaking of bread is in the homes and at other times, especially if they are unable to come to a meeting on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of fellowship is a suggestion, not a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a need for more fellowship and study, but we should not be inflexible, confining ourselves to an old way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Over twenty-eight years ago, there were three thousand people meeting regularly in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must study why forty thousand people have been baptized over the past twenty-eight years, but only five thousand meet regularly today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This cannot be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if all forty thousand believers were still with us, our current situation would still be lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A twenty percent annual increase from a starting number of three thousand should have produced four hundred ninety thousand believers, but we have baptized only forty thousand, less than one-tenth of the number based on a twenty percent increase.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we must consider our statistics and study how to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though we are branches in the vine and there is the law of life within us, we must cooperate in our living and in our environment; otherwise, it will be very difficult to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without cooperation, the law of life will be hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all know that if a tree is planted in a place where water flows and the sun shines, it will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, if the same tree or plant is moved to a place where there is little water and insufficient sunshine, it will not grow well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though the tree has life, it will not grow if the outward environment does not match its needs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are some plants that do not grow well in direct sunlight, and they must be planted in cool, shady places.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some Christians are like these special plants; that is, if there is too much sun, they will die easily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must help these ones by starting their growth in the shade.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Other Christians are like plants that easily die from being overwatered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When they get less water and less sunshine, they grow well and bloom beautifully.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be sensitive to the needs of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to supply them, or else they will die.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if we supply them too much, they will die as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we must supply them according to a proper measure.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not visit them, they will not be enlivened, but if we visit them every day, they will die as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some may need to be visited once every two or three months, but each time we should give them a tasty supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not need to force them to come to the meetings, because our constant urgings may damage their desire to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must give them the liberty to come as the Lord leads and take no offense if they do not come.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, we will see the growth of life in them, and we will be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe that many of us have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the past we were fervent, and we tried to drag people to every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our dragging was like pulling on a plant to help it grow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Outwardly, it seemed that this was helpful, but actually we inhibited their growth, and they eventually died because of our overzealousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not have to drag people to meetings or regard them as anything less for not coming to meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must allow these special plants to grow slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not forget them but visit them from time to time to give them a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way they will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Taking care of a church is more difficult than taking care of a garden or a factory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The saints are on different levels and in different conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The saints come in all varieties.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we must coordinate with their environment so that the life within them can grow.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once this life grows, they will bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we do not need to be too stiff or rigid by insisting on a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must consider how to nourish the saints and meet the need of every situation so that they can grow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Being rigid cuts the saints off.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should always consider their situation and their convenience so that they can grow gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even though the annual rate of increase of the church in Taipei is not sufficient, we cannot have a uniform method for everything.</S>
