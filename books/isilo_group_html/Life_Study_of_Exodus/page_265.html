THE BLOOD OF CHRIST OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2><p>The blood of the sacrifices in the Old Testament typifies the blood of Christ. The blood of Christ is the blood of the new covenant (Matt. 26:28). This blood has done many wonderful things for us.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Redeeming the Believers</h2><p>The blood of Christ has redeemed us. First Peter 1:18 and 19 say that we have been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Bringing the Believers to the Tree of Life</h2><p>After man fell, the way to the tree of life was closed. Genesis 3:24 says that God placed &ldquo;at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.&rdquo; Hallelujah, the blood of Christ brings us back to the tree of life! Revelation 22:14 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.&rdquo; This refers to the enjoyment of Christ in eternity. But we can share in this enjoyment even today. Through the blood of Christ, we may enjoy the tree of life, which is God Himself as life to us.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Leading the Believers to the Waters of Life</h2><p>The blood of Christ also leads the believers to the waters of life. In John 7:37 the Lord Jesus said that all those who thirst may come to Him and drink. Eventually, out of our innermost being will flow rivers of living water. We all have experienced drinking the water of life through the blood of Christ. Day by day, because of His blood, we may eat of the tree of life and drink of the water of life. According to Revelation 7:14, those who have &ldquo;washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb&rdquo; will be guided by the Lamb to &ldquo;springs of waters of life&rdquo;(v. 17). This indicates that for eternity we shall enjoy the living water through the blood of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Ushering the Believers into the Holy of Holies</h2><p>Hebrews 10:19 and 20 say, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; This word is a fulfillment of Leviticus 16:11-16. In Leviticus 16 we have the type, but in Hebrews 10 we have the reality, the fulfillment of the type. From Hebrews 10:19 and 20 we see that the blood of Jesus opens the way for us to come into the Holy of Holies. Because the Lord has opened the way and brings us in, we may enjoy God in the Holy of Holies and daily be infused with Him.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Enabling the Believers<br />to Serve the Living God</h2><p>Hebrews 9:14 says, &ldquo;How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.&rdquo; The blood of Christ makes it possible for us to serve the living God. How could we serve God if we were still dead? There is no way for lifeless people to serve the living God. Praise Him that through the redeeming blood we have life and have been brought into His presence to serve Him!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_264.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_266.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Exodus &nbsp; pg 265</div><br></body></html>
