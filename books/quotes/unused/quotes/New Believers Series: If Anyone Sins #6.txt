John 5 records the incident of the Lord Jesus healing one who had been sick for thirty-eight years near the pool in Bethesda
Since a Christian should not sin and should not continue in sins, is it then possible for a Christian not to sin?
Paul said, 'To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord'
If a Christian sins and does not deal with it properly in this age, he will have to deal with it in the coming age
Besides these two terrible consequences, there is another immediate result of sin the breaking down of fellowship with God
Formerly, he treasured the church meetings very much; when he missed one meeting, he felt that he had suffered a great loss
On the day we believed in the Lord, under God's light we only saw the sins that we had committed before we had believed
A man can only be conscious of the sins which God shines His light upon; he cannot feel the sins which he has not yet committed
In saying that the Lord had taken your sins away, you meant that the Lord had dealt with your one thousand sins
If you were saved at sixty-four years of age, you would have said the same thing: 'O Lord, You have borne all my sins'
The criminal on the cross did not believe in the Lord until just before he died, but the Lord took away all his sins
Male signifies everything related to the testimony of the truth, while female signifies everything related to the experience of life
Throughout the Bible the church is symbolized by females, because the church is subjective, being related to the Lord's work in man
A heifer is used here instead of a bull because it represents another aspect of the Lord's work His work toward man
It was slaughtered, and its blood was taken and sprinkled seven times directly in front of the tent of meeting
The heifer's blood was sprinkled seven times in front of the tent of meeting, signifying that it was for God and for the redemption of sin
The sins for which man feels the need of forgiveness, as well as the sins for which man does not feel the need of forgiveness, were there
After the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet were burned with the heifer, the ashes were gathered up and kept in a clean place
When an Israelite brought a bull or a lamb to the Lord and offered it up as a sin offering, he did it because of some known sin
The burning of the red heifer was not for known sins which had been committed in the past, but for future uncleanness
Whenever a man becomes unclean or has touched some unclean things, he does not need to kill another red heifer and offer it to God
He only needs to take the ashes of the red heifer that was offered once and mix them with water and sprinkle them on the body
If a Christian touches something unclean by accident and there is uncleanness in him, he does not have to ask the Lord to die for him again
In other words, the ashes of the red heifer tell us that the past work of the cross is applicable for our use today
John 1:9 says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
Proverbs 28:13 says, 'He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:/but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy'
Only those who walk in the light and who have deep feelings and a repulsion for sin can have genuine confession
If we confess our sins this way, God 'is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
When we sin and when we know our sin and acknowledge it as sin, God will forgive us our sin and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
He is also 'righteous,' which means He must be satisfied with His Son's redemptive work on the cross and must recognize it
When He says every sin, He means every sin, not just every sin committed before we believed or every sin committed in the past
Now we have an Advocate with the Father, who is Jesus Christ the Righteous; 'He Himself is the propitiation for our sins'
Through the Lord Jesus' death and by His becoming the propitiation for our sins, He has become our Advocate with the Father
If we confess our sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
When a child of God sins and does not confess his sin but instead remains in his sin, he loses his fellowship with God
When a child who has done something wrong comes home, he will feel that something is not right because his father will not speak to him
Once we confess this way, we will immediately recover our fellowship with God, and the joy and peace that were lost will come back
