   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was Peter s thought.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was as if he were saying, Don t you realize that the Spirit is here?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have the reaching, the presence, of the Spirit of the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>OF WHOM JESUS WAS BORN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>AND WITH WHOM JESUS WAS FILLED</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament reveals that Jesus was born of the essential Spirit and filled with the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Luke 1 and Matthew 1 unveil to us that Jesus was born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit was the very essence of the person of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, this Spirit is the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From the birth of Jesus, this essential Spirit never left Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, the essential Spirit could not leave Him because this Spirit was His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The essence is the very intrinsic matter of a substance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A piece of wood, for example, is a substance, and in this substance there is an essence.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jesus was born of the essential Spirit and filled with the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then when He came out to start His ministry at the age of thirty, He needed another aspect of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was the economical aspect of power for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The essential aspect of the Spirit is for the intrinsic nature within.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The economical aspect of the Spirit is for the power without.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He needed both aspects for His living and for His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jesus was born of the essential Spirit and filled with the essential Spirit, but when He went out to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He needed the power.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without, Jesus was anointed and empowered with the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, He was a person wrapped up with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit within Him was essential, and the Spirit outside of Him was economical.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The essential Spirit is for life and nature, and the economical Spirit is for power to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jesus was wrapped up with the Spirit of God in these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today we need the same two aspects of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit of God is God reaching us to be life and nature to us and also to be power to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must be filled with the essential Spirit and anointed with the economical Spirit.</S>
