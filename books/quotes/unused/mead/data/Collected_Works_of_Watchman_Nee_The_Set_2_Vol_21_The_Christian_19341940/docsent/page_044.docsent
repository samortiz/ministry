   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us consider some of the dangers a Christian can face.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the apostle, the greatest dangers are to drift and to leak.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us take this first warning as our reminder.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone can leak, and everyone can drift.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can lose everything that God has given to us by leaking, and we can miss everything that God will give to us by drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Pararrhueo means to slide past or miss.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may want to board a big ship moored in the middle of the Whampoa River.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When your little boat tries to come close to the ship, the current will be too strong, and you will not be able to resist the current.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It will be impossible to fight the current, and you will slide past the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what the apostle meant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You follow the tide and do not resist the power of the current.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, you miss your target.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we have to find out where our leakage is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we continue to drift, we will miss our mark.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our present danger lies in our leaking and drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why the apostle told us to give heed and not to be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A careless man cannot be a government official.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A careless woman cannot be a good mother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A careless person cannot be a good child or a good teacher, and a careless person cannot be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No careless person can be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All careless people fail to see the danger of drifting and leaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only the people who give heed will have the eyes to see, and only they will grow spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not give heed enough, and we are too careless concerning spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why we often slide back gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason, the apostle exhorted us to give heed more abundantly to the things that have been heard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul said that we have to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling Phil 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to work out our own salvation by cultivating a fear for our own weakness and a fear for God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians are fearful of nothing today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In spiritual matters, fear is one thing that is very necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we live in jesting and laughter every day and if we are careless in everything, without seeing the need of fearing God, and if we do not have any feeling for anything, but are nonchalant and unconcerned about spiritual matters and ignorant of their value to us, we have not seen our need and have not realized our danger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is the result of such dangers?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The following verses tell us where we will drift to and what we will lose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may think that to drift and to leak are not serious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the apostle warned us soberly concerning what we will lose by drifting and leaking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What did the apostle say?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 3 says, "How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sin is present.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How shall we escape?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What are we neglecting?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are neglecting so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a minute we will see what this great salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps we can touch upon it briefly now.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many sinners perish because they would not let go of one meal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many others perish because they refuse to let go of a little sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are many instances like these.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sometimes a gospel meeting starts at six, and a sinner needs to eat at half past six.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because of his meal, he perishes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has neglected so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes a gospel meeting starts at eight, but a person needs to go to sleep early.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result he misses his opportunity again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But many Christians are negligent also.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They have allowed the gospel which they have heard and the things of Christ which they have heard to leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They do not care if these things have leaked away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The result is that they miss so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the salvation spoken of in the book of Hebrews?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I dare not say anything about the salvation mentioned in the other books.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the salvation spoken of in the book of Hebrews is a salvation that saves us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jesus lives forever and will save us to the uttermost 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is an uttermost salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is this salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This salvation is not just the forgiveness of sin through the blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross, and it is not just deliverance from hell into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Of course, the salvation in Hebrews includes the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But it has to do particularly with us becoming a fully saved person while living on earth, and with our receiving the glory together with Christ in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Let me ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose a brother has done something which is not very proper.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His family may say, "Would one who believes in Jesus do such a thing also?"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although this person is not going to perish again, and although he will not become unsaved, one does not find him different from other men; there is no distinction in him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is standing on the ground of an unsaved person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Suppose you have a bad temper, and you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have heard about the Lord Jesus being your overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yet this matter has slipped away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because you have drifted, you do not have the experience of it, and you lose your temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What will your classmates and colleagues think of you?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They will think that you are the same as they are, and that you lose your temper just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The unbelievers will say that such a believer still loses his temper, and is no different from anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In this way, you have neglected so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You have not allowed the Lord to save you out of the sin of your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You have not distinguished yourself from the unbelievers, and have missed so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Suppose there are many clerks working in a shop.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is a small thing in the world to receive a little bribe.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But suppose you are one of the clerks.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you are the same as the others and are not separated from them, you have neglected so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When unbelievers take a taxi, they often argue with the drivers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But if you do the same thing, others will say that you are the same as everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They will not sense your difference among them, and you will miss your great salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You have not shown your distinction among them in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Among us there are many who are children to their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Last night I heard someone say that he did not agree with his mother because she was not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The worst thing for a mother to find is that her children complain that she is not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Before a mother is saved, her children can say such a thing about her.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But what happens now that she is saved?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If her children still say the same thing about her, and if she has not changed at all, she has missed so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Sometimes people say, "Your children are the same as my children.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There is not much difference."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When this happens, you have lost your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Many times, we would rather be ridiculed than lose our distinction before our family.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They can be wrong, but we must not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Our difference and our contrast with others is our strongest testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I know of one mother who is much opposed by her children, only because she wants them to be different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But she insisted that her children be different from the time they were very young.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is the proper way for children in Christian families to be; they are different from the whole world around them.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>That mother has been a real Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>She has not neglected so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>She is distinct, and she maintains her testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have to be afraid of not being distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We have to be different from the world in the way we dress, in the way we handle affairs, and in the way we use our money and our time.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>You have to be different from the world even in the way you use your towel.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Please remember that we should never drift or slip with respect to God's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We have to preserve ourselves from drifting away from so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>God's salvation not only includes our life in this age, but it includes the kingdom and being in glory with the Lord in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Salvation is not just for this age; it is for the coming kingdom as well.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In order for us to have so great a salvation, and share in the glory of the kingdom, we have to preserve our distinctiveness and should not drift or slip.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Finally, let us consider this whole passage briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We will read from verse 1 on.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>"Therefore we ought to give heed more abundantly to the things which have been heard..."</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We have to give heed to the things which have been heard, which are the things concerning Christ, lest we drift away, lose, or leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We must not leak away or drift away, because there is "the word spoken through angels," which is the Old Testament law.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The law was ordained through angels Acts 7:53; Gal 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Such a word through the angels should not be transgressed against or disobeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>To transgress is on the positive side, while to disobey is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>"Every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense."</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>How much more serious will it be if we neglect so great a salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This salvation is different from anything else in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>It was not preached by men, but by the Son of God; it was conveyed to us by the glorious Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We cannot escape, because this salvation had its beginning in being spoken by the Lord, which is different from the law described in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If the law was spoken through the angels, and those who transgressed against it suffered great punishment, "how shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation, which, having had its beginning in being spoken by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who heard, God bearing witness with them both by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by distributions of the Holy Spirit according to His will"?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This is the apostle's warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>He exhorts us not to drift or leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This is the Lord's own word to us, and it is testified to by God and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>May the Lord be gracious to us, that we not be careless in the things which we have heard from God.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Never think that only those who have committed gross sins have backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We should not drift, and we should not leak away!</S>
