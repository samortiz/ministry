<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(c) Submissive</H2><P>Rebekah was also submissive (vv. 64-65). When she saw Isaac and realized who he was, "she took a veil, and covered herself." Sisters, do not put a piece of cloth on your head as a decoration or ornament. It must be a sign of your submission. Once you are married, you are no longer your own head. Your husband is your head, and your head must be covered. This is the true meaning of marriage.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(4) Laban and Bethuel</H2><P>Laban and Bethuel were in the fear of the Lord (vv. 29-31). They were also very hospitable (vv. 31-33). Hospitality often brings in the greatest blessing. For Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel and the sister of Laban, to become Isaac's wife was a great blessing. That blessing was secured by their being hospitable. If they had not been hospitable but rather had rejected Abraham's servant, that wonderful marriage would never have taken place. Furthermore, they accepted the Lord's sovereignty, saying, "The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good" (vv. 50-51, 55-60). Laban and Bethuel recognized that this was the Lord's doing and that they had no right to say anything about it. Here we see the atmosphere of their life, a life in oneness with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(5) Isaac</H2><P>Isaac was not a man of activity, for he did not do anything. He simply dwelt by a well, by a place of living water. Verse 63 says, "Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide." Translators of the Bible are bothered about the rendering of the Hebrew in this verse. Some versions interpret it as meaning that Isaac went to the field to pray, and others say that he went to the field to worship. It might have been that Isaac was meditating in the presence of the Lord, possibly considering his marriage. He had lost his mother, did not have a wife, and the most trustworthy servant had gone on a journey. Isaac did not know if the servant would ever come back. The family had no safety or security, and he was in a desperate situation. Hence, he went out to the field to seek the Lord and meditate before God. While he was meditating, Rebekah came. After the servant had told Isaac all that had happened, Isaac took what his father had done for him and married Rebekah (vv. 66-67). His marriage was an inheritance, not a strife. He did not strive for a wife; he inherited what his father had done for him. He did not do a thing to get a wife. He only took what the father had secured for him. Acting in this way, he was one with the Lord that the purpose of God might be fulfilled in him. He had a real and solid marriage without a wedding ceremony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(6) Fulfilling the Purpose of God</H2><P>Isaac's marriage eventually fulfilled the purpose of God (21:12b; 22:17-18). The life of those in this chapter was not merely for their own human living; it was a life that issued in the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, a life which brought forth Christ and produced the kingdom of God for God's economy.</P>
