   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 19:13 says, "Keep Your servant from presumptuous sins;/Do not let them have dominion over me;/Then I will be blameless and cleared/Of great transgression."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This tells us that God's servants have two kinds of sins before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One is the sin of rebellion, and the other is the sin of presumptuousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you do not do what God wants you to do, this is the sin of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all know that this is a sin, and we are all willing to remove this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>None of us wants to commit this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But brothers and sisters, please remember that not only is rebellion a sin; presumptuousness is also a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do what God has not commanded us to do, we are committing the sin of presumptuousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rebellion is to refuse to do what God commands us to do, whereas presumptuousness is to do what God has not commanded us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Any activity outside of God is presumption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God says that one should not commit fornication or steal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a man transgresses in any of these things, he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is something we know.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we also think that we can do what God has not commanded us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not realize that this is sin also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God has not commanded you to do something, yet you do it according to your own will, you have committed a sin before God even though you may think that you have done a most wonderful work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>David's prayer was excellent; he prayed that God would keep him from the sin of presumptuousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God knows what He wants, and He reveals what He wants through the Bible or through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Spiritual work is not a matter of quantity but a matter of being according to God's use and will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The most important thing for a servant of Christ is to know what God wants from him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A characteristic of the new covenant is that man can know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A servant of Christ can receive the revelation of the Holy Spirit within himself; he can know clearly God's requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of knowledge is real; it does not come from one's imagination or from others' persuasion or instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of knowledge cannot be learned from the letter of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These commandments from God are revealed by the Holy Spirit to a person's spirit, in the deepest part of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How many today truly understand spiritual revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How many can truly say, "I have seen it"?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people have replaced God's own work with things they consider to be good and spiritual, things that they zealously pursue after, and things that they consider to be beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are more volunteers in God's work than called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people can only say, "I have come"; they cannot say, "I am sent."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why many of the so-called works of God are filled with deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many works are not approved by God; they are merely the result of man's zeal for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man does them because he thinks that God needs them, and he calls them the works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, in this kind of work the element of God is almost nonexistent; there is almost nothing that is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Genuine spiritual work is not initiated by us, but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our only responsibility is to discern God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Any work that has any genuine spiritual value finds its source in the heart of God; we work only when the Holy Spirit puts a revelation in us and gives us the understanding of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In spite of the vast differences in outward appearance and results, there are only two kinds of service to God that which has its source in God and that which has its source in man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One is what God wants, and the other is what man thinks God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Dear brothers and sisters, what kind of work are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is unfortunate that many servants of Christ do not pay attention to the sin of presumptuousness, or shall we say, are not thoroughly clear about the nature of presumptuous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have not allowed the Holy Spirit to bring them to the point where they deeply judge themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have not yet realized that God is the only Master and that there is no place for them to propose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need the conviction of the Holy Spirit to show us the sin of presumptuousness and God's hatred toward such sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should realize that it is a sin for us to not do what He has commanded, and equally a sin for us to do what He has not commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not say, "Since God has not stopped me, why can't I do it?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, we should say, "How can I possibly do what God has not commanded me to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who do not know the Lord deeply will think that they can do what the Bible has not forbidden them to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But those who know the Lord deeply realize that even though the Bible does not forbid them to do many things, they are committing a presumptuous sin if they do anything without God's explicit command.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers and sisters, God will bring us to a deeper place one day, and we will realize that it is not enough to refrain from rebellion against God; it is not enough to refrain from doing what He forbids us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We also have to refrain from doing what He has not commanded us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we can stop our self-will from doing what God has not commanded, we will be perfected, and God can use us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A perfect man is one who will not work when he has not received God's command; he is one who does not commit the sin of presumptuousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If God has not told us to do anything, we should stand still and not move.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God can use only this kind of people; only this kind of person can work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In God's work we see many people working according to their self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man does not care for God's will, God's timing, and God's method, even the best work will be just the zealous activity of the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must realize that the flesh not only opposes God, but it also tries to help God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our soulish fleshly life may have much natural merit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The soulish life can become zealous for God, thinking of this and that way to revive the church of God, coming up with this and that way to increase the kingdom of God, or laboring this and that way to save many sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Soulish believers have good intentions and motives, but they do not realize that the fleshly life is bringing about all their zeal, planning, design, and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They do not realize that only what God has commanded is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They think that nothing can be better than engaging oneself in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They do not know that the fleshly life, even if it comes with good motives, wonderful goals, or laudable results, is not pleasing to the Lord, because it is not according to God's will and not suitable for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They also do not realize that God will not lend His strength to any work that is not done according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They think that the zeal, noise, emotion, energy, and tears of their work are being supplemented by God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Little do they realize that they are drawing from the power of their natural life to supply a work that issues from their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What is the reason for such presumptuousness?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is nothing other than a desire for the expression of the self-life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many people obey God's command when they know of it, yet in their heart, they do not have a desire for His will; they still prefer their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, when God is silent and does not speak, they become presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brothers and sisters, if we do not judge the flesh and take up our cross to deal with the self-life, we may obey reluctantly when God's command comes, but when we have no command from Him, we will act according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In God's work, those who are presumptuous do not necessarily have a bad motive.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before we turned to God, our self-life did not have any desire to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But after we turned to Him, we began to have a desire to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the most dangerous period.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the past we had absolutely no desire to serve God, but now we want to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, we want to serve according to our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But God demands that we not only serve Him but also serve Him according to the way He approves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Man frequently makes the mistake of thinking that God only wants our service and that we can choose the way to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have to realize that God does not approve of any service that is not done according to His direction.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, not only must our work be ordained by God, but also the method, timing, and procedure of the work must be determined by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No matter how good man's motives are, these motives cannot replace God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No matter how successful man's work is, no success can replace God's approval.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Too many works are done solely for "meeting the needs of the circumstances," for "edifying the spiritual life of the believers," or for "saving sinners' souls"; they are not done out of obedience to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We cannot say for sure that these works have not produced any result.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But these works and these workers are of no use in the sight of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our primary concern should not be the outward needs of the sinners and believers but God's need of the hour.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our work should first meet God's needs, not the needs of the sinners or the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are God's servants, and although He has entrusted the responsibility of the work to us, He reserves the authority to direct the work for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Although the Holy Spirit summoned God's servants to their work, Paul and Barnabas could not go to Asia according to their self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The matter depended on whether or not God had a need at that time in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Acts of the Apostles wonderfully shows that the One who gives the power for work and the One who dictates the direction of the work is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The responsibility in our work is to meet God's need in this hour.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Bible shows us that we are not hired but bought by God with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God has the absolute, sovereign right over us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Therefore, we cannot do anything according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>God has not entrusted things to us so that we can make proposals according to our own view.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He does not do things this way.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>God has specific instructions for us concerning every work of His.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we act presumptuously without waiting for His command, we will not be approved, and He will not use us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Our work will not stand the fire and will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Bible shows us that God wants to manifest His work not only in big things but also in small things.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Therefore, we have to allow Him to have preeminence in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We must acknowledge God not only as the Lord of big things but also as the Lord of small things.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He is through all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If our work is not according to His will, we may win man's praise, but God will not be able to use us.</S>
