<p>The Lord Jesus not only died for us; He also resurrected for us. His death solved our problems on the negative side, resulting in our redemption. His resurrection also accomplished many positive things, resulting in our salvation.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Raised for our justification&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 4:25; see also John 16:10).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection proves that His death satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements. Since His death satisfied God, God raised Him from the dead. His death paid our debt to God&rsquo;s righteousness. Although the debt was paid, the proof of His payment required a &ldquo;receipt.&rdquo; Although the Lord died to pay our debt, we would have no proof of His payment without His resurrection. Thus, we would not know whether His death satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement as well as God Himself. His resurrection was a &ldquo;receipt&rdquo; issued by God according to His righteousness upon payment of the debt. His resurrection declares that His death satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement; thus, God can justify us according to His righteousness. When we see the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension, we are clear that our debt before God has been paid and that a &ldquo;receipt&rdquo; was issued. We no longer have any problems before God; God has justified us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead released His life and imparted His life into us by means of the Holy Spirit so that we could be regenerated. Therefore, His resurrection not only resulted in our justification objectively but also gave us a life that works out righteousness subjectively.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;If Christ has not been raised...you are still in your sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:17).</p>
<p>If Christ had not been raised, we would still be in our sins, because without His resurrection, we could not have received the life that delivers us from sin. Since Christ&rsquo;s resurrection caused us to obtain the life of deliverance, it has delivered us from sin. We have Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life; thus, we can have a sinless living in this sinful world.</p>
<p>A man who sold Bibles from village to village told people that if they would read the Bible, they would be able to refrain from sin. A scholar who heard him asked, &ldquo;How can man not sin in this world of sin?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It is possible! A fish can live in the sea without being salty.&rdquo; A person who possesses Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life can live in this sinful world without being contaminated by sin.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;In Christ all will be made alive&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:22, see also vv. 17-18, 20-21; John 11:25-26).</p>
<p>The death of Christ dealt with our sins. The resurrection of Christ delivered us from death, because Christ&rsquo;s resurrection gave us a life that cannot be held by death (Acts 2:24), a life that overcomes death and breaks the power of death. Those who believe in Christ and have His life &ldquo;shall by no means die forever&rdquo; (John 11:26); even if we should die, we shall live (v. 25).</p>
<p>We were dead in Adam, but through the resurrection of Christ we obtained His life. Christ&rsquo;s life swallowed death; thus, we can be delivered from death in Adam and live forever. Even if we die, we will be raised. Just as Christ&rsquo;s death eliminated the dread of sin and solved the problem of sin, His resurrection eliminated the fear of death and solved the problem of death.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Made us alive together with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:5-6; see also Rom. 6:5; Col. 2:12).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way of salvation included not only our dying with Christ but also our being made alive together with Him. We died with Him; we were also made alive with Him. Dying with Him, on the negative side, delivered us from the old creation and everything apart from God. Being made alive with Him, on the positive side, brought us into the new creation and everything that is in God. His death delivered us from everything outside of God; His resurrection brought us into everything that is in God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:19).</p>
<p>We were made alive with Christ, and His resurrection life entered into us and is living in us. Because He lives, we also live. His resurrection and resurrection life cause us to live with Him. We live with Him by and through His resurrection life.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;It is Christ who lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>We were raised with Christ and live with Him, and He also lives in us by His resurrection life. Christ not only died for us but also lives in us. He died for us on the cross, and in resurrection He lives in us. He died on the cross once for all according to God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, but He is always living in us so that we may live a holy life. His death on the cross satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement; His living in us causes us to live a life of holiness. He died for us that we might be justified; He lives in us that we may be sanctified. He lives in us to be our holiness, life, power, and everything.</p>
<p>God has not given us a dead salvation but a living salvation. Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection are the main elements of God&rsquo;s salvation. The death of Christ is related to the negative aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation, whereas the resurrection of Christ is related to the positive aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation. These two aspects show God&rsquo;s full salvation. God&rsquo;s salvation would be incomplete if either of these were missing. God could not solve our problems on the negative side without Christ&rsquo;s death, and God could not bring us into His riches on the positive side without Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Praise and thank the Lord that Christ died and resurrected! God&rsquo;s salvation includes Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
