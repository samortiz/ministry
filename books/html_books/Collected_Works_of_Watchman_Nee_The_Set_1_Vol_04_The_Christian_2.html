INTRODUCTION (VERSES 1-3)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse One</H2><P>Verse 1: "The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John."</P><P>"Revelation" is the opposite of concealing. It means to open a curtain. Revelation is God opening the curtain of the future to reveal to men the truth behind it. This really convicts many people! God points out the subject in order to encourage those who read and hear. Yet, how men despise this book! Revelation means unveiling. After all, is a revelation an unveiling or a concealing? Can the things which God reveals as a guide for our daily living and for our keeping (v. 3) leave room for any doubt, that we may not know how to follow them? If you do not read Revelation, there is really no excuse!</P><P>Many people make the mistake of taking the "revelation of Jesus Christ" to be the coming again of our beloved Lord. Indeed, many times the Bible considers His revelation (His manifestation) as His coming again. Here, however, it clearly refers to this book because it is the "revelation...which God gave to Him to show to His slaves." This book, Revelation, is not only inspired of God (2 Tim. 3:16), but is also revealed by God. There is a difference between revelation and inspiration. Revelation is what God gives to men directly, without which no one has the ability to know the truth within it. Inspiration is God keeping men from making mistakes and causing what they write to be absolutely true and dependable that others may gain benefit and blessing. The revelation here is the same as "revelation" in 1 Corinthians 14:26. It is what God reveals; it is not concerning the coming again of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>"The revelation of Jesus Christ"! This revelation is of our Lord. When we hear His name, are not our hearts burning like fire? This book speaks forth the special value of our Lord. It reveals our Lord, and without it we cannot know Him. This is the revelation "which God gave to Him." Those Christians with spiritual knowledge can see the peculiarity of this word. Even though this revelation is of Him, God gave it to Him. He Himself did not have it! This book comes from God as God. It is not God as the heavenly Father revealing this revelation of His Son in His house. Here our Lord is not acting as the only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, enjoying an intimate Father-Son relationship. Rather, it is God on the seat of the universal government instructing His slave Jesus Christ. The sense here is the same as that which is mentioned in Mark 13:32: "But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father." In the Gospel of Mark, He is the Son of God to be a slave. The slave does not know what the master will do; he only knows what the master has told him. In this book, the position of God is neither the Father of the Lord Jesus nor the Father of Christians. In this book the Lord Jesus is a man and a slave of God exalted by God. He did not exalt Himself. This is really an example for all His slaves! He orders them to walk the path He walked. It is only there that they can have fellowship with Him. It is even more remarkable that there is no other inspired writer in the New Testament who exalted the incomparably great divine glory of the Lord Jesus higher than John did in his Gospel. Yet, it is also John who in Revelation described in detail His glory as a man, having, of course, not concealed His deity.</P><P>Revelation is also what the Lord Jesus showed unto "His slaves." This book is a book for slaves. He did not show Himself as the Head of the Body to His disciples or as their friend to disclose to them what was in His heart. Rather, as their Master He shows His slaves the things which "must quickly take place." How different this is from John 15:15: "No longer do I call you slaves." In the Gospel of John, the sole purpose of the Holy Spirit is to point out that those who believe in the Lord Jesus are children of God. John 1:12 says: "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name." After the Lord resurrected from the dead, He said, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (20:17). Here, however, we stand on a different ground. What is said here is not in the relationship of an individual with the family of God, but the responsibility of an individual in the administration of God. Although this book mentions God's wonderful redemption, the Holy Spirit does not refer to God as the Father, except in five places where it refers to Him as the Father of the Lamb.</P><P>There is a big difference between a son and a slave. The saints are not slaves first, then sons. We do not become His sons by serving Him but by believing in His only begotten Son. This does not, however, annul our responsibility of serving God. After we become His sons, we should consider Him as our Master and should obey Him in everything. This is God's arrangement. The meaning of slave here is the acknowledgment of the legal right of the Lord. In the original text this word should be translated "slave." Paul (Rom. 1:1), Peter (2 Pet. 1:1), James (James 1:1), and Jude (Jude 1) all called themselves slaves. If we are not slaves of the Lord, we are not free men! We were sold to the Lord because He purchased us with His precious blood. Therefore, according to legal right, we belong to Him forever and are His slaves. We should pay attention to one thing: our salvation is accomplished completely by the Lord Jesus. As soon as we believe in Him, we are forever saved. However, this is not the end. It does not mean that once we are saved and become the children of God, that is the end. On the contrary, it is the beginning of our life. From the day we were saved, we have been the children of God positionally, and this position will never change. At the same time, we are His slaves to serve Him in works. The children of God who sincerely obey Him are His slaves. Much serving in works without obedience will not touch God's heart. Obedience will be a test before the judgment seat.</P><P>Let me say a further word here. To serve God and to work for Him is indeed the responsibility of every child of God. However, is there not much self-righteousness and disobedience in man's works? Perhaps many works will completely disappear before God's light! Many people may be able to say, "Behold, so many years I have been slaving for you and have never neglected a command of yours" (Luke 15:29), but they are outsiders to the sound of joy in their Father's house! Many people can pray, "I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get" (Luke 18:12). Our loving Lord, however, said that the sinner who smote upon his breasts saying, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner" (Luke 18:13) is more justified by God than they are. Let us serve the Lord, not because of duty, nor because of the praise of men, but because of our love to Him. The service of a slave should be based on one's position as a son. "He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised" (2 Cor. 5:15). How different are those who serve due to fear of future chastisement, from those who labor due to love of the present Lord! Though labors of love require in many instances the denial and humbling of ourselves, we do not murmur or complain. There is only rejoicing; there is nothing else. The book of Revelation is for such persons. "Show to His slaves." Only when we stand in the position of slaves is there a possibility for us to understand this book. Therefore, if we are not worthy of such a title, we cannot expect God to show it unto us.</P><P>The word slaves means all the slaves. Some are very lowly; others are very noble. Some are very manifest; others are very hidden. Apart from the eyes of the Lord, no one can see them. Thank the Lord, if we are faithful to serve Him, He is pleased to accept us no matter where we are. He does not care for our position. He only cares how we are in our position. Lowliness and seclusion cannot prevent us from having fellowship with God and His Son. Exaltation and manifestation, on the other hand, without real experience to match them before the Lord, is very dangerous. Mere outward glory without inward dying with the Lord will cause spiritual bankruptcy. No matter where we are or what we do, we should all receive encouragement and reminding from Revelation. Since the Lord is so loving as to show this book to His slaves, may the Lord cause us not to neglect His gift.</P><P>After reading the phrase, the things which "must quickly take place," we must not think that since the word spoken then was to "quickly take place," it should have been fulfilled by now. God's wisdom is clearly seen here, because if God told His slaves that there would be twenty more centuries before Christ would come back, it would cause people to slumber. It was possible that Christ could have come back then. According to the God of patience, one thousand years are just as one day. The prophecy here has just such a spirit. The word "shortly" in Romans 16:20 is the same as the words "must quickly take place" here. The promise in Romans 16, like that in Revelation, is also yet to be fulfilled. When we read on, we will see that there are indeed many things which have already been fulfilled (cf. chapters two and three). At that time the church age was still unsettled. That is why the Lord Jesus Himself said, "Behold, I come quickly." Accordingly, His saints should have their loins girded, their lamps burning, and they themselves like men waiting for their own master (Luke 12:35-36). May we be prepared for the Lord's coming today!</P><P>According to the spirit and nature of this book, we can see that this book is not the Lord's direct instruction to His slaves. Neither is it the Lord's direct instruction to John. Rather, "He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John." Here, John was not the disciple who was "reclining on Jesus' bosom" "whom Jesus loved" (John 13:23). Rather, he was His "slave." What a responsibility this is! Stephen said that the law Israel received was by the ordinances of angels (Acts 7:53). The book of Hebrews makes a contrast between "the word spoken through angels" and that which was "spoken to us in the Son" (the Lord Jesus) (2:2; 1:2). Here, the Lord Jesus also spoke to John by His angel. By this we know that this book goes back to the realm of the children of Israel in the Old Testament. This book shows how the Lord deals with the worldly people and how He takes care of Israel, His people. This book does not speak of the particular rights of the church. It only speaks of her responsibility to Christ. She is a branch grafted onto the true olive tree; if no fruit is borne, she will be hewn down. If one does not understand this characteristic, it will be difficult to understand Revelation.</P><P>The angel who spoke to John was clearly mentioned again in chapter twenty-two: "And I John am he who hears and sees these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. And he said to me, Do not do that! I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers the prophets and of those who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God" (vv. 8-9). He was not jealous of the worship of men! He was a "fellow slave." A true slave of God must be like this slave. To be jealous for men's praise is to rob God of His glory. How good it would be to cause someone to worship God while keeping oneself hidden.</P><P>We should pay attention to one more point: What the angel signified to John was the things which "must quickly take place." The words "quickly take place" mean "to be accomplished in a short time." Hence, in this book whatever was signified by the angel was to be fulfilled in a short time. Anything else was not to be fulfilled shortly. Chapters one through three cover what the Lord Himself said. Therefore, they were not fulfilled in a short time. What the angel signified are the words after chapter four. To make "known by signs" means to point out clearly. Compare John 21:18-19 and Acts 11:28 and 25:27. To "signify" also carries the sense of "to perform." God "performed" the coming acts to John through the many visions.</P><P>Since this book is given by God, sent out by Christ, signified by the angel, and written by John, we should receive it. How wise the Lord is! He solemnly proclaimed to us the importance of this book beforehand in order that we would receive it attentively. What a pity that though it is so solemn, there are still many who despise this book! How different are their thoughts from God's!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Two</H2><P>Verse 2: "Who testified the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, even all that he saw."</P><P>What John saw was "the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ." Here we have only the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. John did not see a third thing. He did not testify something besides the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. He only wrote what he saw. "All" includes the word of God and the testimony of Jesus, which are the things John saw. The "word of God" is the revelation given by God to Jesus Christ; it is the many visions the angel signified unto John. The "testimony of Jesus Christ" is the testimony He (Christ) testifies to the churches of the "word of God." Here we see the whole book of Revelation. Here it does not say "the testimony on behalf of Jesus Christ." Rather, it is He Himself who testifies of the word of God. God gave the revelation, and He testifies of this revelation. Therefore, 22:16 says, "I Jesus...testify to you (the churches) these things." Verse 18 says, "I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll." This is God's view of this book! This is the thought of the Lord Jesus toward this book!</P><P>What a difference there is between the revelation of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ in this book and what is recorded in the Gospel of John! There the Lord Jesus is the Word of God, who is full of grace, and He testifies of the Father. Here, in Revelation, "the word of God" is "the revelation of Jesus Christ." When He is clearly called "the Word of God," there is no reference to grace. "And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God" (19:13). Here, what He testifies is not the Father because the name of the Father seldom appears. (The Father mentioned in 1:6; 2:27; 3:5; 3:21; and 14:1 all refer to the Father of the Lord Jesus.) Rather, He testifies of the God of judgment and of the power of His kingdom.</P><P>John bore witness of what he had heard and seen. Here the Holy Spirit of God did not speak His thoughts to the churches. Rather, He entrusted the revelation of the prophecy to John. This prophecy concerned the churches in the world; it also concerns the world itself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Three</H2><P>Verse 3: "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and keep the things written in it, for the time is near."</P><P>After reading this word, who can say that this book is not profitable? One who does not read it because it is hard to understand, or one who understands it but thinks it has nothing to do with spirituality, cannot help but suffer loss. It seems the Lord foreknew that His slaves would forget this book, so at its beginning He especially extols it. What a pity that many people do not even see such a praise. It is not only so at the beginning of the book, but also at the end of the book, where the Lord also said, "These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place. And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this scroll" (Rev. 22:6-7). The Lord tried His best here to encourage all those who contact this book. Not only the one who reads is blessed, but also those who hear and keep the words are blessed. The one who reads is singular; the ones who hear are plural. This is to encourage those believers who are illiterate! Those who hear are also blessed because there is also an opportunity to keep this prophecy. We should take note of the difference between the blessing at the end of the book (22:7) and the one at the beginning of the book. At the end of the book there is the omission of the one who reads and of the ones who hear, because at the time of the end of the book, the one who reads already has read and the ones who hear already have heard. Now the problem is the keeping. Those who have opportunity to keep the prophecy of this book will have the blessing of keeping it, which is the blessing for those who read and hear. The Holy Spirit knew this book would be neglected by people, so He gives special blessing to those few who are willing to read and to hear. In 22:19 the Lord Jesus prohibited man from taking away from the words of this book, but some even take away the entire book!</P><P>This book is for practicing. It is not merely for people to ponder and consider. We can see this from the word "keep." He who keeps is blessed. Prophecy can be kept. Many people think to study prophecy is not important. Of course, prophecy is not related to our salvation, but after we are saved, are we not to please God? Can we stop at merely getting saved? May God save us from being so selfish! In addition, the judgment at the coming back of the Lord Jesus Christ often causes unbelievers to fear and thus turn to the Lord. To us it is the hope of blessing; to them it is the inevitable judgment. To study prophecy is not to stir up the curiosity of the unbelievers, but to cause them to be fearful and trembling before the Lord. Not only so, to study prophecy will make us desirous of the glory of Christ and of the joy and blessing of the future. To look down upon prophecy is to look down upon His glory and grace and to lose the motivation for our good works. This word "keep" means to obey and follow this book until our daily walk is fully governed by this book. We should "buy" it, pay the price. People in the world will see it as a useless sacrifice. If we really want to gain it, we should "count the cost." All truth requires this of us. Obedience is the first important thing. We should not put restrictions on the word of the Lord and fix the limit in which we will obey. How deeply such a heart is hidden within! We should not invent a kind of evil explanation to cover our nakedness because we are not willing to obey the truth. If we really want to understand this book, our spiritual condition before the Lord must be without fault. Wholehearted obedience of the truth and unconditional obedience will cause us to be completely prepared, waiting for that day.</P><P>The book of Revelation really demands us to keep its words. It is not vain to keep them. Rather, it is a blessing. This book demands a great deal, but the blessings it bestows are also great. Although it sometimes seems very difficult to keep according to the flesh, is not the yoke of the Lord easy? Is not the burden of the Lord light? (Matt. 11:30). He who knows the Lord will not consider the Lord a "hard man" (Matt. 25:24), much less the "taskmasters" of Egypt (Exo. 1:11). Our sacrifice now will be for our eternal benefit. The loss at the present time is for a real gain. The more we lose, the greater our joy will be. He is worthy of our obedience. Therefore, in order to please His heart and in order for us to gain the blessing, we must examine the hidden parts deep in our hearts to see if our love and goal are solely for Christ. Are there, perhaps, still many things you would "spare" (1 Sam. 15:9)? Blessed are those who can say as the psalmist, "Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way" (Psa. 119:128)!</P><P>Now let us look briefly into why those who read and hear this book have special blessings. If we read the words of God with a heart for them, then to read the words of God is a blessed thing. There is, however, only this one book in the Bible in which God explicitly promises blessings to the readers. Why? Let us expound a little. When we see how the Lamb suffered and endured in the world, our hearts are drawn toward Him in love. This book shows us His glory so that we come to realize the greatness of the Lamb's glory which He obtained through His humiliation. Not only does it speak of the Lamb's glory, but the glory of those who follow the Lamb as well. This turns our dark and cloudy sky into sunshine. What a hardship there is now for those who really love the Lord! They are impeded in everything, and for the Lord's sake they tolerate and even suffer silently. However, this book tells us that the Lord will wipe away their every tear and satisfy their hearts with the Lord. What a blessing this is! Knowing this will strengthen the power of our endurance. Moreover, this book clearly tells us things that are going to take place in the future. Everyone likes to know about the future so that they will know the way to prepare themselves and the principle to follow in their daily walk. Worldly people, however, have no way to find out about the future, but our God has not kept the future in the dark. In Revelation He tells us of future events in order for us to walk now in the light of the future so that we will not err or work in vain. He tells us the coming end of all worldly things so that we would come to realize that "the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever" (1 John 2:17). In this way we will not build our hope on this temporary world. Furthermore, this book tells us the hope of Christ's coming again so that "everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure" (1 John 3:3). The coming again of the Lord is the greatest motivation for the believers' sanctification. The truth of the coming again should govern us in our conduct. Those who do not know the power of God's word think that the knowledge of the Lord's soon coming makes people lazy, but no clear understanding of the truth will lead men to do things that displease God. First John 3:3-4 shuts up man's vain mouth. Thank the Lord that there is such a blessing for those who read Revelation!</P><P>Many people admit that the epistles sent to the seven churches are very useful, but they look down on the other portions on prophecy. The Lord, however, blesses particularly what man despises-"this prophecy." Although the Lord did not speak to the churches directly in the portion on prophecy, His will is that the churches would benefit from the entire book. The Lord's intention is to use this book, while it is yet a prophecy and before it has become history, to open our understanding and to stir up our love. While the time is near but has not yet come, we should all the more listen to, read, and consider this book. Revelation is a timely book for the present! However, since Revelation is a book of blessing to its readers and hearers, man begins to cultivate a selfish heart in thinking that everything in the book, including the seals, trumpets, bowls, and so forth, refers to the church! Still, the word of the Holy Spirit is very clear! We should pay attention to this book, not because we are within the sphere of this prophecy, nor because these things have already come to pass, but because "the time is near." It is not yet, but it is near. We should remember that the church is standing on grace. We should not move the foundation of the church of Christ away into the fearful sphere of this book. God gave this book to us for the purpose that we may escape all these things. It is only when we do not receive its warnings that there exists the possibility of being caught in the tribulation. To go through the tribulation is not a blessing; to escape the tribulation is indeed a blessing. We should not consider all the prophecy in this book to be the history of the church. If the saints at the apostolic age, who were not in the tribulation, could benefit from this book, surely it can also benefit us. The Bible does not teach us that we will benefit from a prophecy after its fulfillment, that is, after the prophecy is over. Rather, it says "Blessed...for the time is near."</P><P>What time is at hand? If we compare verses 6 and 7 in chapter twenty-two with verse 3 which we just read, we will see they are almost the same. "I come quickly" seems to have the same meaning there as "the time is near" here. Because the Lord is coming soon, those who read, hear, and keep the prophecy are blessed. Because the Lord is coming quickly, the things related to Him will also come quickly. Those who do not read this book will find that they will miss something while caught in other things. The "hour of trial" is near (3:10); we should "watch and pray" that we will not be caught in it. The time of "harvest" is come (Mark 4:29); the ripe ones will be gathered into the barn, and the green ones will be left on earth. The time of "judgment" is come (1 Pet. 4:17); will we gain the prize or will we suffer loss? The time of "restoration" is come (Acts 3:21); the promises given by God through the prophets are soon to be fulfilled. Can we go in with the Lord to be kings together with Him? May we have only one goal, which is to please the heart of the Lord, so that we will not suffer loss in that day.</P><P>"The time is near." Was the time near even twenty centuries ago? It seems that God did not set a definite time for the coming again of His Christ. The reason why He still has not come even until today is not His delaying, but His long-suffering (2 Pet. 3:8-9). Notwithstanding, this "time" is still "near." He intended that all the saints, from the ancient times until now, watch and be ready while they are alive for the coming of His Son. Paul was such a one at his time. It is very strange that Satan will cause people to think that since the Lord did not come back, He will never come back again, or that we will have to wait for ten million years before He will come back! Is this not absolutely contrary to the Lord's words: "I come quickly"? When we look at the situation now-the situation of the church and of the world-we cannot help but repeat the words, "The time is near." We should know that the Lord Jesus could have come back at the time of John. He did not have to wait for these twenty centuries to pass by and for any other prophecies to be fulfilled. As we have said before, it is the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to select seven churches that existed simultaneously at that time to show that there was actually no need to wait and that the Lord could have come back even then. After this, however, the Lord delayed, and these seven churches became effectively a picture of the history of the churches throughout the generations. This is similar to the Lord's word to Peter concerning John, "I want him to remain until I come" (John 21:22). Oh, how I hope that I could be like Simeon: "And it had been divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ" (Luke 2:26). How I long to see His face!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>B. GREETING AND BLESSING (VERSES 4-5)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verses Four and Five</H2><P>Verses 4-5a: "John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne. And from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth."</P><P>After we have read the previous three verses, we are clear about the special characteristics of this book. Now we come to the book itself. The style of the book is a letter from the dear apostle "to the seven churches which are in Asia." The Asia here is not the continent of Asia but a Roman province in Asia Minor. We should distinguish what is said here, "John to the seven churches which are in Asia," as different from the seven letters in chapters two and three. What is in chapters two and three is what the Lord instructed John to write in seven letters to the seven churches in seven localities. Each church received only the letter which was sent to herself. The letter here "to the seven churches which are in Asia" is not merely chapters two and three, but the whole book. The whole book was a letter from John to these seven churches. What is in chapters two and three was the Lord's own letter to the seven individual churches. What each received was different from the other. Here it was John's letter to the seven churches; it includes the whole book, which also includes chapters two and three.</P><P>These seven churches were "in" the province of Asia. John did not call them the "the church of Asia." All those in Asia did not become one church. There is absolutely no such thing as the people of a whole country being incorporated into one church. The church is in a sinful world, but she is not of the world. Asia does not have a church. However, there are churches in Asia.</P><P>Furthermore, here it does not say "the church which is in Asia," but "the seven churches which are in Asia." There is no "Associated Church" or "United Church" in the Bible. The individual churches in Asia did not unite to become one large church in Asia. They were still individual. They administrated on their own according to their localities. They bore their own responsibility directly to the Lord. Although they were all in Asia, the Bible distinguishes them and calls them the church "in Ephesus," "in Smyrna," and so forth. Perhaps they were willing to labor together and to confer with one another in those days. In spite of this, John only knew them as individual churches. Here we can see the error in uniting many churches together and calling it "The Church of Christ in China." Moreover, when we read verse 11, we see no names for any of these seven churches. Ephesus, Smyrna, and so forth are the names of localities. The Holy Spirit says only the church in a certain locality; He does not say a certain church in a certain locality. From the Lord's viewpoint His children cannot be divided because of the names of a church. The Lord uses a locality, such as Ephesus and Smyrna, as the unit of a church. Nowadays there are many churches in one locality. This actually is not the Lord's intention.</P><P>Brothers, if we know the truth, yet our conscience is not touched, the result will be dryness in our spiritual life. Every truth is for us to put into practice. Many people want some truth, but they are afraid of all the truth. If we obey the Lord in all things but rebel against Him in one thing, His heart will not be pleased. To violate one is to violate all. Concerning the church, all of God's children know that it is wrong to have denominations. Nevertheless, how many have left the denominations because of this? Truly, how easy it is to accept the truth on our lips! It is vain to hope that the whole church will obey the Lord and be changed. If a sinner were to wait until the whole world believes in the Lord before he would believe, I am afraid there would be no time for him to believe. Why are we the same way? Now, at the end times, every day the church and the world forsake the Lord yet more and more. We should not hope for them to change because the Bible tells us they will not change. They will become worse day after day. Now man has all kinds of problems concerning the church, but if we were willing to obey the Lord in a simple way, where would all the problems be? The most pitiful thing is that men are not willing to listen to the Lord, but plan and organize many groups to substitute the simple way the Lord has set up in the Bible. We know deeply that confusion will increase in the future, but may the Lord strengthen the ones that really belong to Him so that they may be bold to obey the Lord and not be deluded. If we are willing to submit to the Lord and seek Him with a humble heart, the Lord will surely show us what we should do. May the Lord's word not fall upon stony places!</P><P>Now we come back to the main subject. These churches in Asia had lost the Christian faith and the spiritual power. We will come back to this point later. Paul said in 2 Timothy, "This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me" (1:15). From this we know that the churches in Asia had already forsaken the "apostles' teaching" and were far away from the situation of Pentecost! Since this was the condition of the churches, this book was not written with the purpose of building up the church, nor does it say much about God's mercy toward men. Here we see God judging evil in the church and in the world. "It is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God" (1 Pet. 4:17). Therefore, the Lord talks first about the judgment of the church, then about that of the world.</P><P>The name of our God here also matches this point. "Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth." Here we see that grace and peace are from the Triune God. How different is this book from the Epistles! Here it is still "Grace to you and peace." However, it is no more "Grace to you and peace from God our Father," nor is it "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ." (Please compare the first chapter of each Epistle.) Now grace and peace are from Jehovah who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ. We may notice that it is different from the other Epistles not only in tone; the names are addressed in a very different way. Let us look at this in detail.</P><P>God's name is "Him who is and who was and who is coming." This is the "Jehovah" in the Old Testament-the "I am that I am." "Him who is" is the name of Jehovah. Hence, it is spoken first. "Who was" declares how He dealt with the earth, with men, with Abraham, and with Moses. "Who is coming" indicates that He will still be administrating in the coming eternal age. He incorporates into His name the eternal past and the eternal future. This is the covenanted name of the God of Israel. In the Gospels and the Epistles, He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now He does not use that name, but He returns to the name that He used to establish the covenant with the Israelites in the Old Testament. Does this not shame the ones who think that they are more loving than God? They think that the concept of God in the Old Testament is incomplete because the Old Testament says that God is a righteous God and is the God of Israel. Here they are reprimanded by the word of God. God is now in the New Testament using the Old Testament name! This God has never changed. He combines two eternities in Himself. After all, the New Testament does not create another God for us, nor does it remake the old God of Israel! What the New Testament exalts is the One who never changes. Thank God, He exists from the beginning to the end. He does not change amidst all changes. His kingdom is eternal. This is what we rest our faith on! Now God returns to grace Israel. Therefore, even when He speaks to the church, He uses the Old Testament name. Before He returns to Israel, He should judge those who call themselves His church. After He gives up the church that exists in name only, He will give grace-not law-to the tribes of Israel. Because of the substitutional death of the Son of God, God's grace flowed to the Israelites. The use of this name is to prove this fact. Although this is so, now is still the time of His patience, and grace and peace are still coming to us from Him. May we be faithful!</P><P>Grace and peace not only come from that eternal One, but also from "the seven Spirits who are before His throne." We know this indicates various kinds of works of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, chapter four verse 5 uses the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne to represent Him: "which [lamps] are the seven Spirits of God." Again, chapter five verse 6 uses the seven eyes of the Lamb to represent Him: "which [eyes] are the seven Spirits of God." Here it says "seven Spirits." It does not mean that there are seven Holy Spirits. Paul in Ephesians clearly says that there is "one Spirit." There, the church before the Lord is also "one Body" (Eph. 4:4). However, here we see that the Lord uses the seven churches to represent the whole church. Likewise, the Lord says "the seven Spirits" to indicate one Holy Spirit. Ephesians indicates the oneness of His person in the heavens. Revelation indicates the diversity of His works on the earth. "The seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth" (5:6). Moreover, when we read Isaiah 11 we clearly see how He is related to Christ in the future kingdom. There it also speaks of His seven kinds of power. The seven Spirits are before the throne of God. The throne is the place where God administrates His government. We see how the Holy Spirit here is connected to God's government and is not for building up the church. To be before the throne is to work for the throne. In addition, grace and peace come from Him! All of God's administration on the earth is to give us grace and peace. If we believe this, how restful and bold we will be!</P><P>Usually, grace and peace are from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ to the church. Here not only the style of the writing is different, but the order is also different. Grace and peace come first from Jehovah, then from the seven Spirits, and then from Jesus Christ. I believe the reason for this is that in this book, Christ is not expressing His own glory in the Godhead nor His own relationship with the church. In this book Christ is the God-man exalted by God. That is why He is mentioned after the Holy Spirit. The reason the Epistles only mention God the Father and Christ in reference to grace and peace without mentioning the Holy Spirit is that in the age of grace the Holy Spirit is from the Father and testifies for the Son; He does not speak anything of Himself (John 16:13).</P><P>Now let us come to our Lord Jesus Christ. Here it says He is: (1) the faithful Witness, (2) the Firstborn of the dead, and (3) the Ruler of the kings of the earth. Here it speaks of Him as the Son of Man and not as the Son of God. At least, the latter is not mentioned. Here it does not mention His incarnation, which shows His status as a God-man, nor does it mention His ascension and Headship over the church, which indicate His divine power. Here it mentions only His past works on earth and His future glory on earth.</P><P>Our Lord is "the faithful Witness." Isaiah 55:4 says that God has "given him as a witness to the peoples." When our Lord was judged, He Himself also said, "I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth" (John 18:37). Later, Paul spoke to Timothy concerning this matter: "I charge you before...Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, that you keep the commandment spotless" (1 Tim. 6:13-14). Since the Lord witnessed a good confession, we should follow His example. Many people who witness for God have failed in varying degrees, but our Lord is faithful. "Who was faithful to Him who constituted Him" (Heb. 3:2). The Holy Spirit mentions specifically the word "faithful" here to alarm the unfaithful and the disloyal churches. God does not speak of His success but of His faithfulness. Oh, how the church differs from the Lord! Nowadays, most people pay attention to the outward success and despise or even forget the inward faithfulness! God says that the Lord Jesus is the witness because He witnesses faithfully. If our hearts are not faithful to the things of the Lord, though we may have many successes, the Lord is not concerned. We should search our hearts lest we vainly toil and labor. This will be a great help to those who think they are a failure. Because they have failed, many people have been tempted to give up the Lord's pattern. On the one hand, we should remember that we are not the master but the slaves, and we are not free to do whatever we want. On the other hand, the Lord we serve is faithful, and all He asks is that our hearts be pure, single, and faithful. He is not concerned about our success. Our Lord faithfully witnessed unto death. From the world's view, Calvary was His failure. Actually it was not Him who failed, but the prince of the world. Indeed, the outward death is easy, but the inward death is very difficult. Without the inward death, what we witness will not be from the heart; it will not be true. We should die witnessing and witness dying. The Lord was very willing to be defeated outwardly in order to gain the victory in reality. If this is the way of the cross, the victory of victories, then what about our works?</P><P>Our Lord is the victorious One after all. He never failed, and He will never fail. Although He died, He was "the Firstborn of the dead." He was the first One who, though dead, did not allow corruption to touch Him. There is no one like Him. Therefore, He is not only "the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep" (1 Cor. 15:20), but also the One who has "the first place in all things" (Col. 1:18). Because He had faithfully witnessed, He became the Firstborn of the dead. Because He is the Firstborn of the dead, He obtains all things as His inheritance and is the Lord of both the dead and the living. This is His victory.</P><P>When the time comes, He will come again and be "the Ruler of the kings of the earth." This resembles the word in Philippians 2. The Lord Jesus as a man humbled Himself unto death. Therefore, God has highly exalted Him. These are all related to the person of the Lord Jesus as a man. Because He was so perfect as a man, He obtained all the promises and gifts that God gives to man. Not only is our Lord like this; He desires that we also be like Him in these three things: we are to be His witnesses, our hope is to attain unto the out-resurrection (Phil. 3:11), and we are to desire after the reigning together with Him as kings in the future. The future things have not yet come. What will be in the future all depends on what is now. If we do not witness faithfully, though we will not lose our salvation, we will lose the glory of reigning with the Lord in the future. May the joy in the future attract us now, so that wherever we are, we will witness faithfully for the Lord in words and deeds-faithful in purpose and also in means.</P><P>"Grace to you and peace," from the faithful Witness, the One who has overcome death, the future Ruler of the kings, unto us! May we all not look down on this. There is one passage in the Old Testament that speaks of these three names of our King: "His throne...as a faithful witness in heaven...Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth" (Psa. 89:36, 37, 27). We see that this prophecy of the Son of David is fulfilled in our Lord. Glory be to Him!</P><P>"Grace and peace!" We should not forget what these are. Grace is first, then peace. Peace is according to grace. It is ignorance to try to have peace with God without first obtaining the grace of God! While the world was in enmity with God and had lost its peace, God graced it in sending His Son to die on the cross in its stead, shedding His precious blood, thus making peace. Now, whoever is willing to accept God's grace will obtain it and have peace with God. Grace and peace are not given to us once for all when we first believe. Rather, they are an unceasing supply. The Triune God's grace and peace are always unto us. The grace here is in opposition to the coming law, and the peace is in opposition to the future battle. When God actually forsakes the church, which up until now is only planned but not realized, grace and peace will cease. He will again execute His law and will declare war with the world. This is the word of the apostle John's greeting and blessing. How kind and loving it is! In man's eyes, though He is the loftiest One, He still does not forget the tender and kind word. There is no place for coarseness in godliness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>C. EXULTATION (VERSES 5-7)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verses Five through Six</H2><P>Verses 5b-6: "To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen."</P><P>Such is the way we have received God's grace, enjoyed God's peace, and are prepared for the works set before us! We are in the presence of the everlasting and omnipresent God. We are supplied by the Holy Spirit with the power we need. We are encouraged by the Lord. We see the victory that is sure! Now, we cannot help but be impressed by how much He has accomplished for us! Now, our hearts cannot help responding to Him! If our hearts are not in tune with that of the Lord, the result will be shame on the battlefield. In ancient times there were psalmists singing before Jehoshaphat's army. Now, there should be the same in the Lord's camp. In this way we will definitely be victorious (cf. 2 Chron. 20:21-22). When a person who is intimately related to the Lord hears about the glory of the Lord, he will surely be reminded of his relationship with the Lord. When the saints hear about the Lord Jesus' testimony, resurrection, and reigning, they cannot remain silent. If they do, even the stones will raise their voices. Thus, at this point they burst into singing:</P><P CLASS="indent1">To Him who loves us<br>And has released us from our sins by His blood,<br>And made us a kingdom,<br>Priests to His God and Father,<br>To Him be the glory and the might<br>Forever and ever. Amen.</P><P>This hymn of praise of the faithful saints suddenly broke out from John's mouth. It is our confession of His name and of our indebtedness to His redemption. Confessing Him in this way will cause us to be separated from the world which has rejected Him. This will also join us unto Him and make us His disciples and His testimony. "Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name" (Heb. 13:15). To confess His name and to praise the Lord are the most excellent works of the saints. Even though what is described here is not the intimate relationship between the Lord Jesus and the church but rather His glory as the Judge, nevertheless, those who really love the Lord cannot but raise their voices to praise Him. This is because we are not afraid of judgment. We know that He "loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood."</P><P>He "loves us!" Yes, He loves us. In the original text "love" is in the present tense, meaning that He now loves us. "Released" in the original text is in the past tense, meaning that He has released us from our sins. How do we know that He loves us now? We know because He has washed away our sins by His own blood. His present love is measured by His past work-the shedding of blood and the washing away of sins. We all have to measure in this way! Any other method is not dependable! Do not use your changing feelings and experiences to measure the love of the Lord! We know that He loves us now, for no reason other than that in the past He has shed His own precious blood to wash away our sins. Who can comprehend all the worth of the precious blood of the Lord? We have to remember this always. If one is "idle" and "unfruitful," it is because he has "forgotten the cleansing of his past sins" (2 Pet. 1:8-9). Remembering the grace we have obtained when we were saved enables us to grow in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. May the Lord cause us to realize this: all that we have are but sins. Yet, He loves us and He cleansed us. Thank God for the washing in the past and the unceasing love in the present! We thank the Lord because He loves, because He shed His blood, and because He loved us unto the shedding of His blood!</P><P>We can see His love not only through the shedding of His blood and the washing away of our sins, but also because He "made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father." Formerly, God promised the Israelites, "And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests" (Exo. 19:6). This promise, however, had a condition. If they were obedient, then they would be such. However, they failed. Therefore, only the Levites became the priests. Yet, even their priestly service could not pass the veil. The grace of God now enables us to be joined together as one kingdom, a kingdom of priests. It enables us to enter into the Holy of Holies to have fellowship with God. The Lord Jesus, who expresses God, has already put us before Him-a place of joy, praise, and intercession. This is our present position. Every one of us is a priest of God. We give praise to God, intercede for other people, and rejoice in ourselves. It is very pitiful, however, that even though we have this kind of position, many of us do not have the experience of being God's priests now. If we are asked to take care of some business, we might be able to handle it, but if we are asked to serve the Lord, we become helpless. However, those who cannot serve the Lord within the veil will never suffer without the camp.</P><P>Why did He make us "a kingdom, priests"? This refers to the future. In the coming kingdom, the Lord will make us a kingdom of priests. At that time we shall not only be priests individually, but we shall be joined together to be a priesthood, as a kingdom. This means we shall all be priests. We are "a royal priesthood," "to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 2:9, 5). "Royal" means kingly. When the kingdom comes, we shall not only be priests, but we shall also be kings and priests. We shall be kings. This, however, refers to the future and not to the present. In the future, we shall reign with the Lord and receive the incomparably great glory. This will be realized in the kingdom. As for now, we are joined together with God's High Priest to be priests in the Holy of Holies. We ought to serve the Lord with all of our heart and forget about the gain and loss in the world. We should not seek after the transient world. Our hope is in the future. May the Lord discipline us so that we will discipline ourselves not to covet or to envy the vanity under the sun. Let people look down on us, ridicule us, hate us, and ill-treat us! We have the brightest future! Now we are hidden by the veil; we are small and unnoticed. The day will come soon, however, when we shall have the authority to rule, whose sphere will be the whole earth, and whose duration will be eternity. May we receive more grace to be the priests to serve God and the kings to carry out God's will on the earth. May we be absolute for God.</P><P>Here, we ought to pay attention to one thing. Our being kings and priests is based on the precious blood of the Lord Jesus. Because of the shedding of His blood, our sins are forgiven. It is because of the shedding of His blood that we can be kings. Why did He shed His blood? Because He loves us. Our being kings is based completely on His love and grace. If this is the case, does it mean that all the saints will be kings in the millennial kingdom? There are many places in the Scripture which answer, "No." If to be kings is a matter of grace, why cannot all believers be kings? We have to realize one thing: God's grace has prepared salvation for all men, but are all the people on the earth saved? No. Why is this so? It is because some of them do not believe. They do not accept God's grace by faith. In the same way, God's grace has prepared a glory, that is, a kingship, for the entire church. Yet, because the saints do not have the act of faith to receive God's grace, they cannot all be kings. Not all men on earth are saved; not all saints are granted to be kings. Therefore, we all need to be very careful. We should not go to extremes. It is fully the Lord's grace that believers are made kings. We have no merit in this at all. Yet it does not mean that because of the Lord's grace the responsibility of the saints is annulled. Our responsibility is to receive this grace by the act of faith. If we believe that we shall obtain glory in the future, can we still covet the present glory? If we believe that we shall be kings in the millennial kingdom, can we still admire the great men of this world? Therefore, our being kings is by grace and is also by works. Without suffering we cannot be kings. Our suffering is the means through which we receive the glory. For the sake of the glory to be manifested in the future, may we once again guard our hearts from being attracted by the world!</P><P>"To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever!" When the saints hear the name of the Lord Jesus, they are reminded of His works. It is when we consider how He loves us and how in love He shed His blood for us that we may receive the glory, that we cannot refrain from raising our voices in singing: "To him be the glory and the might forever and ever!" Our praising the Lord is not because we have strong feelings or special experiences. We praise because of His unchanging love. Our voice of praise should not be uttered according to our wavering feelings and poor experiences. We should praise the Lord because of the Lord Himself. We should see how He has saved us in the past, how He will glorify us in the future, and how He loves us now. We should consider Him, His works, His person, and Himself. This will make us able and willing to praise Him regardless of our condition, and in this way we will certainly give all the glory and might to Him. Even in eternity this will be the way we praise Him.</P><P>Here, the "Amen" is added so that our individual voice can echo with the churches' voice. It is indeed a blessing to be able to share a place among the innumerable multitude, having the same theme and the same joy. Yet it is equally a blessing if we can utter with our own voice and express our own joy individually. The apostle said He "loved me and gave Himself for me." Is there not a difference between this and He "loved us and gave Himself for us?" Our individual voice should not be lost in the multitude. Each one of us should have things which we can praise the Lord for. A particular experience results in a particular song. May we all have our own "Amen" to harmonize with the joyful noise of the multitude. When one's heart responds to the love of the Lord, he is ready to testify for the Lord. When one receives grace, he sings praise, and after he sings the praises, he should tell the world of what he has. If one is with Christ, he will want to bear witness for Him in the world. One who has the same kind of life as Enoch's will undoubtedly have the same testimony as Enoch's. "And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him" (Gen. 5:24). This is he that testified, "Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints." The saints of God living in this world should be like Enoch, walking with God and witnessing for God. If we read the following verse, we will see how the faithful saints raised their voices for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Seven</H2><P>Verse 7: "Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him. Yes, amen." </P><P>Although verses 5 through 7 are all exultations of the saints, verses 5 and 6 are their praises while verse 7 is their testimony toward the world following their praising of the Lord.</P><P>Here we see two matters: first, the fellowship between the saints and the Lord; second, the testimony of the saints toward the world. The most joyful thing in a Christian's life is to have fellowship with the Lord. It is through seeing Christ and through realizing the blessings we have in Him that we are drawn to fellowship with Him and to worship Him. Because of this union with God, the saints are brought to a knowledge of the future of the world. This is a part of our testimony; it is not something we pursue after day and night. If a man studies prophecy, surely he will discover many wonderful and interesting matters, but he will hardly have a heart to fellowship with the Lord. Prophecy has its place, but to pay too much attention to it will nourish one's mind and starve one's spirit. No matter how capable a man is in interpretation and analysis, only God's grace is able to lead us to have fellowship with Him. Only when we consider the cross of the Lord and recall how He expresses His love, washes away our sins, and puts us in a high position are we able to have a sense of gratitude which results in worship and a worship which results in fellowship with the Lord. It is of course wrong for one to look down on prophecy. This will surely put one into snares. However, if the believers pay attention only to the key passages of the prophecies without touching the love of the Lord, they will not be able to worship the Lord. Furthermore, they cannot lead people to forsake the world. True godliness is borne out of worship. One should first have the fellowship in the heavens before he is able to give effective testimony on the earth. It seems, however, that fellowship, worship, and praise are lost skills among Christians today! If our hearts rest in Christ and if we see in prophecy the Lord whom we love, then prophecy will provide a background to enhance our worship.</P><P>"Behold, He comes with the clouds." Do we have this kind of testimony? Those who know the Lord's coming judgment on the world will definitely make those who drift along with the world very uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the saints will rejoice because the time of their glorification is at hand. The saints, because of their own joy and the world's sorrow, cry out, "Behold, He comes with the clouds." Because of his earnestness in longing for our Lord Jesus Christ's glorification, John seemed to have seen the advent of the Lord already. For this reason he cried out, "Behold!" May the coming again of the Lord be as real in our hearts as this.</P><P>"He comes." The word "He" deserves emphasis. This is no one else but He Himself. "This Jesus" was taken up into heaven, and later He "will come." This is the testimony of the Bible (Acts 1:11). The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is neither the coming of the Holy Spirit, nor the destruction of Jerusalem, nor the death of Christians. Even more, it is not the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ now. "He comes" means He Himself shall come. The Son of Man shall come. The Lord they love shall come. Anything else cannot be counted as His coming.</P><P>"He comes." This is neither His receiving of the overcoming saints before the seven years of tribulation nor His receiving of the saints to the air who have gone through the tribulation or who have been resurrected from death at His coming at the closing of the seven years of tribulation. This is the coming of the Lord to the earth with His saints after the seven years of tribulation and before the millennium. We know the overcoming believers shall be raptured to the heavens before the start of the seven years of tribulation. Just before the seven years of tribulation end, the Lord Himself shall come from the heavens to the air to receive all the saints who will be resurrected from death or who will still be living on the earth. Afterward, He will bring all the saints to the earth. If we want to understand prophecy, we need to differentiate these three events and not mix them together.</P><P>The Lord's rapture of the overcoming saints to the heavens is a special matter. It is according to the Lord's promises in Luke 21:36 and Revelation 3:10. Not all the regenerated and saved saints shall escape the tribulation on the earth unless they watch and pray always, setting their minds in the heavens while having their bodies on earth. The saints should not only have life, that is, be saved, but should also have the sanctified life, that is, they should overcome. To many saints rapture is too strange a thing. It involves too much of a change from their present living! This is not right. The will of the Lord is that we would possess the life of ascension now. He wants us to have the real experience of our life being hidden with Christ in God now (Col. 3:3). It is nothing strange for us to have our spirit first taken up to the heavens, then our body raptured. (Of course, in reality there will be many changes.) Our ascension in life is based on the accomplishment of the Lord Jesus on the cross: He joined us to Himself in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension. All these are related to the spiritual aspects. His rapturing of the saints is an ascension in their bodies as well as in their spirits. Our spiritual problems are dealt with at the cross. The rapture to the heavens is just a redemption of the body and not the perfection of the spiritual life. Therefore, those saints who are not joined to the Lord in the experience of His death, resurrection, and ascension will be left behind on the earth to suffer the tribulation. They will not be raptured. We will speak more about this point later.</P><P>Why does the Lord allow them to go through the great tribulation and to suffer? He wants to use the suffering to discipline them. The Lord rebukes and chastens them because He wants them to "partake of His holiness" (Heb. 12:10). If God does not receive His children's response when He calls them with love in grace, He will have no other course but to refine them with rebukes in grace. Unripe wheat cannot be gathered into the barn. Likewise, immature saints cannot be raptured! If the love of the Lord cannot draw their spirits to the heavens, He will, for their benefit, use suffering to turn their spirits to the heavens. This is why so many saints will have to enter the great tribulation. When they are ready, the Lord Himself will come to the air to receive them. At that time, 1 Thessalonians 4 and 1 Corinthians 15 will be fulfilled. Therefore, may the Lord grant us grace and make us willing now to allow His Holy Spirit to work the cross deeply into us through the constraint of Christ's love, so that we will have the genuine experience of being crucified, resurrected, and ascended with the Lord, and that we will gain His pleasure and be raptured.</P><P>After all the saints are raptured and right before the beginning of the millennial kingdom, the Lord will come with the clouds from the air to appear together with the saints. Here, we see the complete union of Christ and the Christians: having died together, resurrected together, ascended together, and appearing together. "When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory" (Col. 3:4). This appearing is the coming to earth for the judgment of the Gentile nations that are still alive on earth.</P><P>In our study of prophecy we should carefully differentiate these three points: the special rapture of the overcoming saints, the coming of the Lord to the air to receive all of the saints, and the coming of the Lord with the saints to the earth. The verse presented here is not a confession by the church of her expectation, but an announcement by the saints of the judgment on all men. It is their testimony to all men. Therefore, this verse speaks about the Lord Jesus coming to the earth. This is in complete agreement with the scenes that follow.</P><P>The Lord Jesus will come "with the clouds." This agrees with the words of the prophet Daniel, when he said he "watched in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven, One like a Son of Man was coming" (7:13). This is also the same as the testimony in Acts: the Lord Jesus "was lifted up, and a cloud took Him away from their sight...Behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them, who also said,...This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven" (1:9-11). The same way He went up with the clouds, He shall come with the clouds. This also agrees with what Jesus said to Caiaphas, "I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" (Matt. 26:64). "Every eye will see Him." How different this is compared with His ascension! This will be the time for Him to receive authority and power. Whether dead or alive, Gentiles or Jews, one day all shall see His face! This is not the Lord's coming to receive His saints! At that time no one can see Him except the saints. The coming again at this time is with form and body. Therefore, "every eye will see Him." Not only so, "even those who pierced Him" will also see Him. The one who pierced the Lord Jesus was a Roman soldier (John 19:34). In reality, however, it was the Jews who pierced Him (John 19:37; Zech. 12:10). Therefore, "even those who pierced Him," although referring to the Jews, includes not only the Jews but also the Gentiles. The word "every" in "every eye" denotes both the Jews and the Gentiles.</P><P>"And all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him." In the original text "the land" can refer to Palestine. Those who shall wail are the Israelites. Zechariah records that the Israelites shall mourn after looking upon the pierced Lord. Please read chapter twelve, verses 12-14. There, only the tribe of Judah (the houses of David and Nathan) and the tribe of Levi (Shimei, Num. 3:18) are mentioned. Perhaps there will only be those two tribes in Jerusalem at that time. Perhaps they were singled out because those two tribes are the tribes of kings and priests. However, "the land" can also mean the whole earth and "all the tribes" can denote all races. Therefore, here it not only speaks of the wailing of the Israelites, but of the wailing of all men. The wailing in Zechariah denotes only the repentance of sins. The wailing here, in the case of the remnant of the Israelites, is for repentance, and in the case of all others, for disappointment and fear. "And at that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" (Matt. 24:30). At that time, the age of grace having completely passed away, God shall favor the Israelites according to His righteousness, and He shall also judge the nations according to righteousness. Rather than wailing at that day, why not wail today! Sinners of the world, why not come to the cross of the Lord today to mourn for your sins? Accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior, and ask God to forgive your sins. Do not wait for that day. On that day, you, a Gentile, shall wail, but it will be too late! Come now quickly!</P><P>Now let me say some more concerning the Lord's coming again and the order of events here. We should read Zechariah. At the end of the seven years all the nations shall gather together to fight against Jerusalem (Zech. 14:2), at which time the Jews shall flee to the Mount of Olives (v. 5). The Lord Jesus shall come with His saints in the clouds and in the glory. The Lord's feet shall stand upon the Mount of Olives (v. 4), fulfilling the prophecy spoken by the two men in white clothing (Acts 1:11). The mount will be split at its middle, and there shall be a very great valley. The Israelites shall flee to the valley of the mountains (Zech. 14:4-5). Afterward, they shall look upon the Lord Jesus whom they pierced (12:10). Someone will ask the Lord what these wounds in His hands are, and the Lord will answer, "Those with which I was wounded in the house of those who love me" (13:6). Then the Israelites shall know that Jesus whom they despised is the Christ. Then they shall mourn and repent (12:10) and shall accept the salvation accomplished for them on the cross by the Lord Jesus (13:1). On the other hand, the Lord Jesus shall judge all the Gentile nations on the earth. At that time, those who treated the Jews kindly in the tribulation will be sheep and shall become the citizens in the millennial kingdom and shall enter into eternal life. Those who ill-treated the Jews will be the goats and shall enter into eternal fire. After these things, the millennial kingdom will begin.</P><P>Let us come back to the text. "Yes, amen." According to the Greek text, the expression "yes" is only one word. The meaning of this one word is exactly the same as "Amen." The only difference is that this one word is Greek, whereas "Amen" is Hebrew. Here the apostle had only one meaning in mind but used two different languages to repeat it. What is the reason? What is recorded in this verse was the testimony of the saints to the world. The apostle ends the verse with these two words, indicating: (1) the church is looking forward to the coming of the Lord "wholeheartedly"; (2) the church testifies to the Gentiles-Greeks; and (3) to the Jews-Hebrews. These two words are the response concerning the Lord's coming again by the saints who love the Lord's appearing. In the Epistles the apostles of the Lord expressed the coming again of the Lord Jesus as the blessed hope of the saints. All those who truly love the Lord long for the appearing of the Lord. Therefore, after testifying to the world that the Lord will come, the apostle spoke these two wholehearted expectations in order to express his earnest desire for the Lord's coming. Although the Lord's coming is to judge all men, to cause all men to wail and to suffer, the apostle said, "Amen." He would not delay the Lord's coming by his compassion toward all men. There is nothing wrong with that because this is allowed by the Holy Spirit and is pleasing to God. Therefore, it is recorded here so that when we read it, we will also say, "Amen" once and twice. We love all men because the Lord loves them. We should not love our work more than the appearing of the Lord. Our hearts have to be attracted by the Lord to the extent that nothing stands between us and our Lord. Indeed, we should love the souls of men and be faithful to our work. We should, however, rest in God because He also loves sinners-much more than we do. He treasures His own work much more than we do. Since He considers that His Christ should come again, we should not question His wisdom, grace, and mercy one bit. His thoughts are the best. At any rate, what we love should not just be men but should be God. What we long for is not our work but rather the Lord who grants us work. He is coming. Are our hearts not joyful? May there be a deeper love and longing between us and the Lord. Here, two Amens were used in verses 6 and 7. Just as a saint desires to see the Lord Jesus glorified and rejoices because He Himself shall have a beautiful future, in the same way he should love the Lord's second coming for the judgment of all those who do not obey Him.</P><P>The church has already testified to the world. Christ is coming soon. The age of grace is drawing closer to an end day by day. God's judgment in wrath is coming nearer day by day. Are there those who listen to this testimony? No. On the contrary, many who love to mock begin to say according to their lusts: "Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue in this way from the beginning of creation!" (2 Pet. 3:4). Therefore, God shall come and testify.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>D. THE TESTIMONY OF GOD (VERSE 8)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse 8</H2><P>Verse 8: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty."</P><P>According to F. W. Grant, a Bible scholar, the phrase "Yes, amen" in the previous verse can also be included in this verse. This means that this phrase, "Yes, amen" was spoken by "the Lord God." Because of men's unbelief, He argued with men and refuted their unbelief. He has proved in the past that the Lord Jesus will be coming soon. He is also proving this now. In these days is He not indicating through politics, religion, morality, and spirituality that Christ is coming again soon? Who can deny that these are the signs? No matter how unbelieving men are, these are still God's midnight crying.</P><P>Here we see John putting God and Christ together. In chapter twenty-two, verse 13, the Lord Jesus also introduced Himself in the same way as here. This shows us that Christ and God are distinguishable yet inseparable.</P><P>"The Lord God" is the name used for God in the garden of Eden. This book tells us how the Lord will recreate a new garden of Eden where man will never fall again. Therefore, when mentioning the new garden of Eden, He is again called "the Lord God" (22:5, 6). Here the two names are combined. "The Lord," which means Jehovah, is the name He used when He established the covenant with Israel. "I am Jehovah...I have also established my covenant with them" (Exo. 6:2, 4 ASV). "God" is His common name, indicating He is greater than any man. "The Lord God" is a very appropriate name, because this name combines all the names God used in past generations, showing that God is the God of all. The One who speaks here is this God. All His promises and warnings are completely true.</P><P>One thing should be remembered: a man's name changes according to place, time, and person. At home two can call each other brothers, but in political organizations they cannot call each other brothers. Therefore, each name God uses for Himself in the Bible has its own independent meaning. God reveals His own name based upon the person and the times. How regrettable that unbelievers do not know this. Consequently many doubts arise about the source of the Bible.</P><P>"I am the Alpha and the Omega." Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet and omega is the last. This shows that He is the beginning of the beginning and the end of the end. He is the One without beginning and without end, who also is the beginning of all things and the ending of all things. Words are for speaking. His word is the beginning and the ending of all speakings. When He speaks, all that must be said is said. In the beginning, all things came into being at His speaking. Since that time He has spoken again, and all things are in place according to His command. The One who is speaking and testifying now is also this One. He is the everlasting God. What He testifies is completely true. He has not only proven the past truths, but He is also proving all the later warnings.</P><P>"He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty." "The Almighty" means "the Lord of hosts" showing that He is the Lord of the universe. "The Almighty" was the name He used to establish the covenant with Abraham. "And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah: and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them" (Exo. 6:2-3 ASV). Here we see that the names of God are names that He used in different ages in the past. The name "Father" of the age of grace is not mentioned. He who testifies is this One, the Almighty who has the ability to fulfill His plan. It is He who is testifying for the Lord Jesus, who was crucified in weakness in the past, but will be worshipped in power in the future. Therefore, His testimony is true.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>E. JOHN ON THE ISLAND OF PATMOS (VERSE 9)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse 9</H2><P>Verse 9: "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus."</P><P>John did not call himself a member of Christ nor did he call himself an apostle. He called himself their brother and joint partaker. How gentle and sweet this is! Even though he was alone on the island of Patmos at that moment, his spirit was with his brothers, suffering together with them, enduring with them, and waiting with them for the coming of the heavenly kingdom. This is the wonderful work of the Holy Spirit, which enables us to suffer together with the saints in every place. Because he had a very deep sympathy with them and a very intimate union in life with them, their suffering was like his own suffering. When they suffered, he was even by their side as their joint partaker. May the Lord give us a bigger heart to receive all the brothers in the Lord so that they will know that we are always joint partakers with them in all things. Those who truly have the work of the Lord's cross in them will surely know how to be united with all the children of the Lord. The cross unites sinners with God the Father. It also unites all Christians who trust in Him. The cross separates us from sinful living, but unites us with those having God's life.</P><P>Tribulation, kingdom, and endurance-these three things indicate the present and future journey of the saints. This kingdom is the millennial kingdom in chapter twenty. However, it does not refer to the citizens in the millennial kingdom but to those who will reign together with the Lord Jesus Christ for a thousand years. In the future, the saints will have no other kingdom except their reigning together with the Lord. Reigning with the Lord is the purpose for the coming heavenly kingdom. This kingdom is the believers' common hope and reward. This kingdom is the believers' future glory and honor. God has called all the believers into His kingdom to gain His glory (1 Thes. 2:12). Have all the believers, however, heard this calling? Are they all able to meet God's demand? I dare not judge, but I am afraid many will lose God's reward!</P><P>The kingdom is indeed glorious, but what comes before the kingdom? It is tribulation. The way to the kingdom is tribulation. Tribulation paves the way to glory! "Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens" (Matt. 5:10). If we take sides with the world, how can there be persecution? If we were "of the world, the world would love its own" (John 15:19). If you leave the world, not only the world's "world" but also the Christian "world" will persecute you. However, it is by this way that we walk to the realm of glory.</P><P>"If indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him" (Rom. 8:17). The present suffering will be the determining factor of the future glory. The more we suffer, the better prepared we will be to gain the glory, because "if you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you" (1 Pet. 4:14). The Holy Spirit prepares us for the glory of the kingdom through tribulation. Before things come to pass, He forewarns us. He will not let us suffer tribulation without warning. He wants us to be willing. He wants us to sit down and count the cost. He told us long ago, "In the world you have affliction" (John 16:33), but by granting a reward He comforts our hearts. He told us, "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne" (Rev. 3:2)-to reign together in the kingdom. Oh, may the future glory be displayed before us! May the Lord help us to realize that we are "granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him but also to suffer on His behalf" (Phil. 1:29). Nevertheless, this suffering is not in vain because the one who suffers will have the reward.</P><P>Although "through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22), if we follow "Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame" (Heb. 12:2), in the future we will be able to sit together with Him on the throne. The more we think about the joy of the coming kingdom, the less we will care about today's small cross. "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed upon us" (Rom. 8:18). God makes glory the strength of our suffering. May the Lord grant us spiritual insight so that we can see the future glory.</P><P>"A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his master" (Matt. 10:24). Our Lord Jesus Christ gained the glory through tribulations. Ascension to the throne is from the cross. The Lord expects us also to walk in His way. What a pity that today there are not many people who will bear the cross. Even sometimes we ourselves see the cross but go around it! Very few people are glad to take up the cross! The Lord is now preparing us to be kings, so He takes us through many fiery trials. If we are not willing, we will lose the kingdom. The Lord is now training us by the cross so that we will learn to obey through suffering. The result is that the kingly nature will be formed in us. The cross is a suffering, but we should not be mistaken in thinking that all sufferings are the cross. When we endure a suffering by the Spirit of the crucified Lord Jesus with the result that the Lord fulfills His purpose and nullifies our intentions, our suffering is indeed the cross. Oh, there are not many kings on this earth! We do not know how many will be kings in the millennial kingdom. Nevertheless, those who bear the cross today will surely be kings in the future because only the one who is a king can bear the cross.</P><P>Tribulation, kingdom, and endurance-we have already seen how the Word of God testifies that we should gain the kingdom through tribulation. Here the apostle also mentions endurance. To those who know the future glory and who for its sake are willing to endure the tribulation, the most important thing is endurance. We know that to enter into the kingdom we must go through many difficulties. If we do not persevere with endurance, we may become those who put their hands on the plow but look backward. We may be counted unworthy by the Lord to enter into the kingdom of God. If by the Holy Spirit of God we would endure tribulation, ever accepting that which is new after that which is old is over, and faithfully allowing tribulation to treat us harshly, to hurt us, to afflict us, and to break us so that God can accomplish His perfect will, our next tribulation will find us with more strength to endure than before. This is because "tribulation works endurance" (Rom. 5:3).</P><P>If one grieves in his suffering, this suffering is in vain. Saints should be like the Lamb of God, who endured without a sound under the hands of the shearers. Our portion now is to suffer. Do not hope for something better than this. The virtue of a Christian in tribulation is endurance. If we endure, we will inherit the kingdom. "If we endure, we will also reign with Him" (2 Tim. 2:12). For this reason we should hold fast to what we have, that is, to endure, so that no one will take away our crown, that is, the future kingdom. "Therefore be long-suffering, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer eagerly awaits the precious fruit of the earth, exercising long-suffering over it until it receives the early and late rain. You also be long-suffering; establish your hearts because the coming of the Lord has drawn near" (James 5:7-8). Oh, many people have already lost this! At the beginning of the journey to the heavenly kingdom, were there not many people? What about now? I am afraid many have gone back to the world! At the beginning of the way of the cross, because of the future earnest hope of glory, many charge forward courageously. However, because of the Lord's delay, the change in time and environment, the attack of Satan, and the delusion of the world, the cross becomes heavy, the old flesh rises and falls, and finally they compromise with the people in the world and leave this narrow way. Truly, if the Lord were to come back earlier, would not all ten virgins have brightly shining lamps? However, the bridegroom delayed. Because of this delay, the line between the wise and the foolish was drawn. "Time" will manifest who has served the Lord faithfully and in whose life the work of the cross has been deeply wrought. Therefore, brothers, endure until the Lord comes. On the one hand, if we look at the signs now, we know the Lord is surely coming soon, but on the other hand, maybe the Lord will not come within ten years or a hundred years. If the Lord delays, can you endure suffering for Him that long, awaiting the manifestation of His kingdom? May we all keep the word of the Lord's endurance (Rev. 3:10).</P><P>Truly the kingdom is real, and the tribulation will be severe. Without endurance we will fail. The apostle put both things together. How meaningful this is! What God delights in is the saints' heart of endurance through their suffering for the kingdom. This matches what Paul said: "We ourselves boast in you...concerning your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which you bear, a plain indication of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer" (2 Thes. 1:4-5). Endurance in suffering will definitely bring us the kingdom. Nevertheless, we should also remember that tribulation, kingdom, and endurance are "in Jesus." Suffering is not to secure one's own reward but is for the Lord Jesus Christ. Whatever is less than this standard will not gain God's delight. It is not up to us to choose how to suffer or what kind of suffering we should have. Everything is for the Lord Jesus! Everything is for the Lord Jesus! Besides Him, we have no interest. Only when the Holy Spirit works in our hearts, causing us to be filled with the will of and desire for the Lord Jesus, are we able to endure suffering for Him with joy.</P><P>Now is the time of "kingdom and endurance." In the future it will be the time of "power, kingdom, and authority." Before the Lord appears in glory, we must pass through suffering in endurance. Once the Lord appears in glory, our sufferings and endurance will cease. Oh blessed hope! Now Christ is waiting for the manifestation of His kingdom. He is waiting for God to make His enemies His footstool. We are enduring with the Lord, waiting for the fulfillment of this hope. Christ together with the Christians are rejected by the world; they hope and endure together and work together!</P><P>The church, however, has already left her position of endurance of tribulation. She desires to seek a place in the world and in society. She loves the glory and power of this life and despises the narrow way of the cross. The blessing of this world should be for the Jews and, consequent to their fall, for the Gentile world. However, here the church is also seeking after the greatness of the flesh. In the present time while many people fail, those who faithfully serve the Lord should all the more be sober. If we forsake sins, we should all the more be humble, for the one who suffers for the Lord, if he does not continue to rely upon Him, may think, "I serve the Lord this way, but no one else does!" If this is so, how can we say it is all by the Lord's grace? Here lies our danger. If one has God's grace to leave everything of the world but does not have the same grace to humble himself, the result is that his separation will become a source of boasting. Now we see the children of God failing on every side. On the one hand, we should depart from sin. On the other hand, we should recognize our failure and confess our sins before the Lord (Dan. 9). Being in an age where Satan constantly attacks God's children, now is not the time for us to boast of ourselves.</P><P>When the apostle addressed himself as "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus," was not his intention for us to be partakers in all these three things? Unless we do partake in them, we will probably not be able to understand the spiritual meaning in this book. If we befriend the world, how can we sympathize with John on the island of Patmos? Since we are brothers together, we should suffer together, hope for glory together, and endure in waiting together. Many of our brothers are still fighting fierce warfare in the battlefield. How can we retreat to enjoy comfort alone? "Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?" (Num. 32:6). To have present gain is to suffer future loss. On the contrary, the present suffering is a future gain. Where there is suffering, there is glory. Where there is no suffering, there is no glory. The more suffering there is, the more glory there is. The less suffering there is, the less glory there is. God is willing to glorify us, but are we willing to receive His glory? Are we willing to take the proper course of suffering to enter the kingdom of glory? Can it be that Christ alone bore the cross and we are left in ease? Can it be that my brothers bear the cross and I go completely unaffected?</P><P>We should make a distinction here. Eternal life is obtained by faith; it is free. "He who believes into the Son has eternal life" (John 3:36). For us, eternal life is assured. We have believed in the merit of the cross of the Lord Jesus and have received Him as our Savior. According to His Word, God has given us eternal life. Hence, we can never perish. Our salvation is fully assured, for the precious blood of the Lord is strong to save us. However, what about the kingdom? "The kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it" (Matt. 11:12). This is very different from the qualification for eternal life. This is not free faith. There is the need for work on the side of the receiver. However, this is not the dead work of the old self under the law. Rather, it is the righteous work of the new man under grace. The problem of our eternal life is solved, but the question of the kingdom depends fully on the way we employ the Lord's grace, how we behave as saints, and how we suffer for the Lord. We should praise the Lord because we have eternal life already, but we must still go on to receive His promised kingdom. Do not think that there is any place for our self-work here. All these works are the result of our drawing our supply from the Lord's grace.</P><P>"I...was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus" (Rev. 1:9). The word of God and the testimony of Jesus here refer to the testimony of John. Because he was faithful to God's truth, he was exiled to the island of Patmos. He believed in another king, the Lord Jesus. He looked for another kingdom, the kingdom of the heavens, which is far better than the Roman Empire. That was the reason he was put into his present state. The island of Patmos was a very deserted place. To the east were the seven churches. Beyond that was Babylon, the great river Euphrates, and Mesopotamia. To the west were Greece and Rome. To the north was Gog. To the south was Palestine and Egypt. This island was in the middle of a vast ocean. Jagged rocks surrounded the whole island. There was no arable land at all. There was no river, no trees. It was a desolate scene. Other than the sound of the wind and the water, there was no sign of life. Because John was faithful to the word of God, he was sent to such a place. If we would not go along with the world and would fight the good fight for the truth, we will also have to go to the island of Patmos. This is the reward in this life for the faithful. The world has not improved from the time of John until now. On the contrary, it has turned worse day by day. If we are strict and unyielding as John was for the testimony of the Lord Jesus and His salvation, how can we expect lesser persecutions than the island of Patmos. I am afraid that the persecution will be more severe! However, Satan tempts many to skillfully avoid sufferings. Some have been spared through compromising with the world. Others have been protected through seeking refuge in rulers. We know that the Lord can protect us. Many times the Lord will not allow us to go through sufferings, but how different is the peace that is obtained through compromise and trust in the world from that given by the Father. Although we are not now at the stage where we crave after suffering, at least we should not lower our standard because of the persecutions and try to please men as a result of this. At any rate, one thing is sure: the minute we disassociate ourselves from the sins and organization of the world, our life in Patmos begins. Still, praise and thank the Lord, for "who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?" (Rom. 8:35). Thank and praise the Lord, for "in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us" (Rom. 8:37).</P><P>The phrase "on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus" may mean that God had again entrusted to John the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. To those who have, there shall be added more. There is no one who has the experience of Patmos who does not have the revelation of Patmos. Did not the Joseph in the prison, the Moses in the wilderness, the David in suffering, and the Paul in chains all have fresh revelations? John was following in their footsteps. Although the Word of God is now complete and there is no need for newer revelations, do not those who follow in the footsteps of the servants of God receive the opening up of God's word and the companionship of the Lord Jesus? This is the reward of suffering. The reward of suffering is the unveiling of the loving face of the Lord. Those that seek after worldly comfort, blessing, and glory may not have the suffering of Patmos, but neither will they have the revelation of Patmos. A fleshly person considers the Lord's cross as a fearsome pathway, but those who love the Lord take the cross and their glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>F. THE VISION OF THE GLORIOUS CHRIST<br>(VERSES 10-16)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Ten</H2><P>Verse 10: "I was in spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet."</P><P>The "Lord's Day" here is the first day of the week, which we commonly call Sunday. The ancient church called the first day of the week the Lord's Day. This is different from "the day of the Lord" in both the Old Testament and the New. The words "the Lord's Day" are different from "the day of the Lord" in the original language. The day of the Lord refers to the long period from the descending of Christ in glory to the renewing of the heavens and the earth by fire. The Lord's Day refers only to the first day of the week, that is, Sunday. If the Lord's Day were to refer to the day of the Lord, then what is recorded in Revelation could only be things happening at the day of the Lord. However, this is not so. The things concerning the seven churches in chapters two and three were all things before the day of the Lord. Therefore, it is very inappropriate to consider the Lord's Day as the day of the Lord. (The Lord's Day is fully a thing of the New Testament. It has absolutely nothing to do with the Sabbath of the Old Testament. The Lord's Day is not the "Christian Sabbath." Christians should not keep the Lord's Day in the way of the bondage of the Old Testament regulations regarding the Sabbath. We should never mix together the Lord's Day with the Sabbath. If we mix the two together, we will bear our yoke in vain!)</P><P>The apostle heard the voice of God's revelation in spirit on a certain Lord's Day. The translation in some versions, "I was in the Spirit," is not a proper rendering, because in Greek there is not a definite article before the word "spirit." This shows that the spirit here does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to the human spirit.</P><P>Man is tripartite, composed of spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23). The spirit is the organ for us to worship God; it has the God consciousness. The soul is our whole personality; it has the self consciousness. The body is our outer shell; it has the physical consciousness. When believers are regenerated, though they have a new life, they are nevertheless still of the flesh and are affected by the body. When they progress to serve the Lord and to grow in grace, they gradually enter the realm of the soul. When believers are in their soul, their actions are mostly determined by their own mind, emotion, stimulus, and feelings. Their life is not a stable one. They are unsteady and lacking in soberness. They cannot serve the Lord and work for Him unless they are burning in heart or feel inexplicable joy. Only if they have a presence of God that can be "felt" will they be able to pray, praise, or read the Bible. If they feel dry in heart, they will not be able to live normally. In the believers' experience, the most important thing is to allow the Holy Spirit to divide the soul from the spirit through the Word of God. In this way they will not be affected by the soul anymore and can be fully spiritual, and their daily life will not be altered by their emotions, feelings, thoughts, and stimulations.</P><P>Here we see how free and unbound by anything was the spirit of John. He had the ascended life (Eph. 2:6). His spirit had left the blockade of the soul and was soaring in the air. Although he was alone on a deserted island under the mistreatment and suffering of the Romans, he was not inflamed by the soul because of this, and this did not result in a confused or bitter heart. The believers should ask for grace in the Lord to separate the soul from the spirit in their experience so that in all circumstances, whether it be the deserted island of Patmos or other harrowing environments, their spirits will not be bound from fellowshipping with the Lord and receiving revelation from Him. Oh, the world may bind us, chain us, and separate us from our friends and relatives. It may deprive us of the needs of the body so that our natural life cannot go on in a normal way, but it has no way to imprison our spirit from ascending to the heavens. On the contrary, in all the trials our spirit ascends day by day until we reach the throne of God. It may seem that the things that surround us have driven us to exhaustion. However, the world cannot cut off the heaven from above our heads. The island of Patmos is an excellent place to lead our spirit into ascension. It is a pity that God's children have often misused and misunderstood God's Patmos!</P><P>Here John was not like an ordinary person. He had some strange experiences. It seemed as if he had lost all sensation of the world and was drawn by the Holy Spirit to separate from his own feelings. The world was left behind, and he was brought into the realm of the spirit to listen to God's word. Originally, he was looking forward to the future glory. Now God would have him to first pay attention to the present condition of the church. Hence, he was turned back (v. 12). He heard behind him "a loud voice like a trumpet." This voice was heard again in 4:1. The meaning of trumpeting is to gather people and to manifest God's holiness (1 Thes. 4:16-17; 1 Cor. 15:52; Exo. 19:16, 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Eleven</H2><P>Verse 11: "Saying, What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."</P><P>This was the word which the voice like a trumpet said to the apostle. Here John was charged to send letters to the seven churches in Asia. Some may ask: "Why was there no letter written to the Judean church in Jerusalem?" At this time (approximately A.D. 95 to 96) Jerusalem had already been destroyed. Perhaps the church there was also dispersed. This might have been one reason. However, why was it that only seven churches were addressed? Other than these seven churches, there were still in Asia the church in Colosse and other churches. Seven is the number for dispensational completion. God chose these seven churches as representatives of the church from the time of the apostles to the end of the age. Seven does not refer to the content of the church, for the church was far from perfection. Seven represents the entire church. There were only seven churches because when God tested the church, she also failed, as did the Jews. The church on earth is merely God's temporal plan. Usually, seven is divided into four and three-four coming first, and then three following. However, in these seven epistles three came first and four followed. In all seven epistles there were God's promises and callings. In the first three epistles, first there were the callings, then the promises. In the last four epistles the order is reversed. I believe there is the mind of God in such arrangement. This shows the degradation of the church: at the beginning there was still God's grace and glory, but in the end she is filled with earthly things.</P><P>These seven churches were actual churches in those days. If the Lord Jesus were to have come at that time, what was written in the seven epistles would have been fulfilled in those churches. However, the Lord delayed, and the Holy Spirit took these seven churches as representatives of all the churches since the time of the apostles. We should take note of one thing: the seven epistles in chapters two and three were sent by the Lord Himself through John to the seven churches. They were not made known to John by the "angel." The things made known through the angel were those that must swiftly take place within a short time. These seven epistles were not made known by the angel. Rather, they were sent directly by the Lord. Hence, they were not fulfilled immediately. The fulfillment of them requires some time. Therefore, these seven epistles represent things related to all the churches after the apostolic age. These churches rose up one after another throughout the generations. We should realize that the condition of these seven churches has a double significance. First, they depict the real condition of the various churches at the time. Second, they represent the condition of the outward church in the various ages. Because we are living at the end of the church age, we tend to emphasize the representation of the condition of the outward church throughout the ages and neglect the fact that they also depict the real condition of the churches at that time. It is this bias that blocks us from the understanding of the dispensational change God has regarding the church. If we want to understand the present position of the church, that is, the position since the completion of the book of Revelation, we have to pay attention to the real condition of the churches at that time.</P><P>These seven epistles, recorded in chapters two and three, are truly different from the other Epistles of the New Testament. They do not seem to have the closeness and intimacy that characterize the Lord's letters through Paul or John. In these seven epistles, the Lord Jesus was standing in the position of the judge, speaking words of judgment and doing a judging work. He was not the Savior and Head as described in the Epistles of Paul and John. Here He was the magistrate of the church, the judging One. If we see this, we will realize that between the churches represented in the book of Revelation and those represented in Paul's Epistles there was a change, a change in the plan of God's dispensation. It is because of the ignorance, or negligence, of this dispensational change in the church that many denominations proclaim themselves to be the unique church.</P><P>Let us now consider a little the history of the church in the Bible. At the beginning God gave His kingdom to the Jews, but the Jews rejected it again and again until they killed God's beloved Son (Matt. 21:38-39). Because of this, God took the kingdom away from them and gave it to the people that would bear fruit, the Gentiles. After Pentecost God raised up Paul to preach the kingdom of God to the Gentiles. The olive branches were broken off (Rom. 11) because of their unbelief. They were broken off for the purpose that we, the Gentiles, the wild olive branches, may be grafted in to partake of the root of the fatness of the olive tree. The Gentiles are able to stand because of their faith. Because God wanted to grace the Gentiles, He revealed to Paul the mystery "which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men." This mystery says "that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel" (Eph. 3:1-10). After this, however, the Gentiles, who made up the church, failed just as the Jews did. We can take a look at the testimony of the apostles.</P><P>John said, "Young children, it is the last hour" (1 John 2:18). How strange this word is to man! Was this not written during only the first few pages of the history of the church? Was this not the period of the infancy of the holy religion? I imagine when the apostle John wrote this, he could still remember the glorious state of Pentecost. The evangelical works around him seemed to be advancing undeterred. However, the Spirit of God said through him, "It is the last hour" because "many antichrists have come." Peter spoke the same thing. He said, "But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their licentiousness, because of whom the way of the truth will be reviled" (2 Pet. 2:1-2). This warning soon became a fact. Jude said also, "For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who of old have been written of beforehand for this judgment, ungodly men, perverting the grace of our God into licentiousness and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ" (Jude 4). Hence, there is the need to "contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints" (Jude 3). Paul's testimony was even more clear. He told the elders in Ephesus: "I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them" (Acts 20:29-30). Not long after, this word also became a reality. When Paul was about to depart from the world, he sent a letter to Timothy saying, "This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me" (2 Tim. 1:15). This was Asia, but what about Europe? The end was the same. From Rome Paul sent a letter to the Philippians saying, "For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ" (Phil. 3:18). "For all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus" (2:21). Concerning the condition of the church then, Paul did not say any appeasing words. He said, "But evil men and imposters will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived" (2 Tim. 3:13). "But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money,...lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power" (3:1-2, 4-5). "For the time will come when they will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and they will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths" (4:3-4). We have seen the testimonies of the apostles which speak of the condition of the churches then. After we read these words, we will realize how the Gentiles in the east and in the west had both failed and had come short of the glory of God. God had warned the Gentiles through Paul: "For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you. Behold then the kindness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity;...if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off" (Rom. 11:21-22). Even when the apostles were still alive, the Gentiles were already not continuing in God's kindness!</P><P>Did God break them off? This is the crucial question. The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 expressed God's view concerning the Gentile churches who did not continue in His kindness. Although these seven epistles contain words of warning, promise, and encouragement, the most prominent feature is their judgmental nature. This was God's final warning to the church. It was the precursor to the judgment seat of Christ. After reading these seven epistles, one can see that insofar as His plan is concerned, God has forsaken His church. In the church in Laodicea, the Lord was driven outside the door already.</P><P>God has rejected the church organization. We can see this from the words on God's gifts: "God has placed some in the church: first apostles..." and "He Himself gave some as apostles..." (1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11). The most important gift and ministry in the church are the apostles, but where are the apostles now? The Roman Catholic Church considers the pope as the successor of the apostles. However, we know that the "apostolic succession" is a heresy. We have to admit that there are no more apostles now. Why is God not giving apostles to the church anymore? To this I must answer: because God has rejected the church and her organization.</P><P>This being the case, what is the age from the time of the churches in Revelation until now? In the old days, God dispersed the Jews all over the world because of their sins, but He still tolerated them again and again. In the same way, although God has rejected the church, in His kindness He still treats the Gentiles with endurance. God desires all men to be saved. Hence, He endures until now. However, we have to know that now, that is, from the time of God's rejection of the church until today, we are in a special period. God's intention at the present time is not to establish the organized church. If it were, He would have given apostles to the church. The fact that He has not given apostles to the church shows that God's intention is not for the organized church. God's intention is to gain more people from the Gentiles unto His name.</P><P>"What you see write in a scroll." If Revelation had been handed down to us through oral communication, one wonders how much would be retained until today. God considers this book important. Hence, He would see to it that it be written down. What God considers worthy of writing, we should consider worthy of reading.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Twelve</H2><P>Verse 12: "And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands."</P><P>Before the apostle was to see the future judgment and glory, he was to first consider the condition of the church. The seven golden lampstands that John saw were a symbol of the seven churches (v. 20). It is God's boundless grace that made Him speak to the churches even then. However, they would soon be rejected.</P><P>Hebrews 8:2 and 5 say, "A Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man....Who [the priest] serve the example and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to complete the tabernacle; for, `See,' He said, `that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.'" The golden lampstand in the tabernacle of the Israelites was but a shadow of the heavenly reality. Scholars studying the book of Revelation often want to ascertain whether or not the lampstands John saw here were the heavenly reality. After careful studying, we will see that they were not. We have to admit that there are similarities between them and the lampstand in the tabernacle. However, we must also realize the difference between the two. The golden lampstand in the Old Testament tabernacle was unique; there was only one lampstand divided into seven branches. The one in the middle was the trunk, with six branches coming off the sides. The golden lampstands that John saw here were different from the one in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament it was one lampstand divided into seven branches. What John saw were seven individual lampstands. That is why the Lord Jesus could stand in the midst of them. The golden lampstand in the tabernacle is a type of Christ. What John saw was a type of the churches. The golden lampstand in the tabernacle is a sign of Israel's union with Christ. That was the reason it could shine in the holy place. What John saw was the condition of individual churches in the world. Every lamp has its own stand. Every church has its own responsibility. The Lord Jesus was standing in the midst of these seven lampstands. He was not joined to them, but was judging them.</P><P>There is a lesson for us here. We learned that the Israelites, God's chosen people according to the flesh, were earthly. Hence, for them, there was an outward union. This is the meaning of one lampstand (not seven) composed of seven branches. However, the church, God's chosen people according to the spirit, is heavenly. Her union is not a unity in earthly forms. Rather, they are administered locally and are each responsible to the Lord. That is why in their form the lampstands are not joined as one but are separate as seven lampstands, each responsible for the shining in its own locality. In life and communion, the churches are one like a body, but in their earthly responsibility and appearance, the churches are administrated separately as seven lampstands. When we read chapters two and three, we see how the seven churches at that time were different in their works, circumstances, failures, rewards, punishments, and responsibilities. To deny this fact is to create confusion.</P><P>This is God's thought towards the different churches on earth. These seven churches do not have a common or unified name. They are not collectively called a certain denomination. In the original language, they are designated as "the church in Ephesus," "the church in Smyrna," etc. There is only one church in one locality. Furthermore, there is no name to these churches. How different this is from the present sects! In appearance, they are seven churches and not one combined church. How different it is from the present demoninations! Because men are not willing to obey the Bible, and because they consider their own organization better than the Bible, we often hear excuses like: "Churches nowadays are not like those in the time of the apostles. They are ten or one hundred times bigger in size than those then. How can the organization of the Bible be applicable?" However, the Bible does not have the practice of joining all the churches to become one denomination! If these people would remember the Scripture concerning the seven lampstands and the seven churches, they would probably not do such things. May God keep us faithful in this time of apostasy. May we not be sectarian and divide the Body of Christ into pieces. One thing grieves me much: whereas formerly God's children were not one according to God's will and have divided themselves under many names, now, while they have the motive of union, they are still acting contrary to God's will in aiming for a unification in name and in form only. It is not a bearing with one another in love in the uniting bond of peace. Such union only opens up the way for the great Babylon of Revelation 17! How sad this is!</P><P>There is much significance to God's use of the golden lampstands as a symbol of the church. Gold is the most precious, glorious, elegant, pure, and holy of all metals. In God's eyes, the church is the rarest treasure in the world. God established the church in righteousness and ordained that she should shine in the world. The church's responsibility is to express God's glory. This is the meaning of gold. However, in reality she may not have this expression. Even though God allotted this privilege and responsibility to her, the church has unfortunately disregarded this entrustment.</P><P>The lampstands are seven in number, yet this is not to say that these seven churches are combined into a perfect church. Seven here does not refer to moral perfection because these seven churches are far from perfect. The word seven represents perfection in number, that is, these seven churches typify a whole church.</P><P>Lamps are used only at night. The lamp of the tabernacle in the Old Testament was lit "from evening to morning" (Exo. 27:20-21) before the Lord: "when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even" (Exo. 30:8); the lampstand "of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening" (2 Chron. 13:11); "and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep" (1 Sam. 3:3). It was in the dark night that the lamp was lit. Spiritually speaking, the present age is an extremely long dark night. The Lord Jesus is the Sun of righteousness, and from the time He was rejected by men and crucified on the cross, the Sun of this world set and the earth fell into great darkness. Our Lord is now dwelling in the heavens. He has established us to be a lamp in the world and charged us to shine. Hence, as the lamp of God, you must now shine. However, our excuses are excessively numerous! "My environment is too poor, so I cannot go on." "The outward opposition is too much, so we can do nothing but hide." "People's hearts are too dark, so we shouldn't waste our efforts." Are these excuses reasonable? Are there hardships? Is there darkness? This is the time for us to shine. If the world were already bright, why should there be the need for us, the lamp? Darkness is the proper time for us to shine.</P><P>Naturally, there are difficulties in shining. Perhaps sometimes it leads to persecution. If, while the true light Himself was in the world, it is said that "men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil," and that everyone "hates the light" (John 3:19-20), how can we, the students be higher than our teacher? However, the time will come, which will not be too long, when we will no longer have the opportunity to suffer and to shine for the Lord. "The night is far advanced, and the day has drawn near" (Rom. 13:12). In this final hour, let us shine faithfully for the Lord in our living and speaking. When the Morning Star arrives, we will be raptured.</P><P>However, the lampstand by itself does not have the light. The shining of the lamp is dependent on the oil and the fire. It is most crucial to remember this. If we are to shine for the Lord, we must rely unceasingly on the Holy Spirit of God and partake continuously of His holiness. If at any minute we are without the oil of the Holy Spirit (Zech. 4:1-14) and the holy fire, then immediately we will cease shining. We often seem to hear the terms "Holy Spirit" and "holiness," but have we actually been filled with these? We can speak of shining later; for now let us first search ourselves to see whether or not we actually have the oil and the fire of God. Oh, how thick is the darkness around us! We earnestly hope to "shine as luminaries in the world, holding forth the word of life" (Phil. 2:15-16). How we desire to be "the light of the world" (Matt. 5:14), to reflect "the light of the world!" (John 8:12). Do we not often feel that we cannot make it? We should lay hold of the oil and the fire of God. O Lord, grant these to us!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Thirteen</H2><P>Verse 13: "And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."</P><P>"In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man." The Lord Jesus is with His church. This fulfills the promise in Matthew 28:20. The realization of the Lord's presence is an extremely precious thought! However, His presence is not merely a blessing. It is also for searching. If we are faithful, with Him in our midst what is there to fear? If we are not faithful, with Him in our midst, how shall we escape?</P><P>"One like the Son of Man." This One is our Lord Jesus Christ. Ezekiel said that He had "the likeness as the appearance of a man" (Ezek. 1:26). Daniel also said that He was "like a Son of Man" (Dan. 7:13). In the Gospels, our Lord often referred to Himself as the Son of Man. Why does it say here again that He was "like the Son of Man?" This shows the divinity of the Lord Jesus. Although He was the Son of Man, He was also the Son of God. He was the Son of Man on the earth, but now He has been resurrected. It is true that He was the Son of Man, but He was more than that. Thus it says that He was like the Son of Man.</P><P>The designation of the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man and the expression here "like the Son of Man" is very meaningful. In the messages "Meditations on Genesis," we saw how God in the beginning created the primal heavens and earth, the angels of the heavens, and the inhabitants of the earth. Then the archangel sinned (Ezek. 28), and the inhabitants of the earth followed him. Therefore, God judged them and the land in which they dwelt. Hence, the land became void and without form as recorded in Genesis 1:2. Later, God recovered the land in six days. Because God wanted His will to be done on earth as it was in the heavens (Matt. 6:10), He created man on the earth to have dominion. Unfortunately, man sinned. He lost his right of dominion and came under the control of the sinning angel (Satan). Because man had failed and had become incurable, God became incarnated as a man, accomplishing what man had failed to achieve. This was the beginning of the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man. Before God created man, He already knew that man would fail. Therefore, He prepared a spiritual body for the Holy Son (Gen. 1:27). It was in this body that He later appeared to men (Gen. 18:1, Ezek. 1:26, Dan. 7:13). When the fullness of the time came, He was born of a virgin, taking on a body of blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14). God put on the body of a man to become the Son of Man. The Son of Man is the designation of God when He became a man. Since He had this body of "blood and flesh," He was the same as other men in all respects. Since He became a man, the Son of Man, He redeemed men from their sins, ending the retribution that the first man deserved due to his sin and regaining what men had lost through Adam. Because He gained the victory as a man, fulfilling the conditions that God had intended man to fulfill, which is to carry out His will on the earth and to destroy the devil's will, God then granted to Him what man deserved originally. Originally God wanted the first man to have dominion over the earth (Gen. 1), but man followed the devil's will and did not do the will of God, thus losing this authority. Since the last Adam became a perfect man, "God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth" (Phil. 2:9-10). The Lord Jesus was a perfect man. He was the last Adam. He became the head of a new race, just as Adam was the head of the old race. Since He is a man, God will hand over to Him the power of judgment and will cause Him to be the King of kings in the millennial kingdom. The glory that the Lord Jesus gains in Revelation is not the glory of Himself as God; it is the glory of Himself as man. After the millennial kingdom, the Son will deliver the kingdom to God the Father in order that the Triune God may be over all things as the Lord of all things (1 Cor. 15:24-28). This is the history between the two eternities before and after our heavens and our earth.</P><P>Originally, our Lord Jesus Christ was God. (In eternity past before the heavens and the earth, the terms "Father," "Son," and "Spirit" did not exist. With His appearing to men, such terms came into use.) In order to save mankind and to have God's will done on earth as it is in the heavens, He became incarnated as the Son of Man. His thirty-some years on the earth were the actual period that He was the Son of Man. Before He was incarnated, even though He already had a spiritual body, He was only "like a Son of Man" (Dan. 7:13). After His resurrection, though He still had bones and flesh, He was no longer only the Son of Man. Hence, He was "One like the Son of Man." Thank and praise God that He has saved us by becoming the Son of Man, and He will forever be the Son of Man to save us to the uttermost.</P><P>We should understand the way of God's redemption. He wants to destroy Satan's power. Therefore, He wants a will on the earth that is joined to His will in the heavens. We know that He has the power to totally destroy Satan and his army in a flash of time, but God does not want to do it this way; He wants man to co-work with Him. Therefore, He created man. When man failed, He Himself became a man-incarnated. After He won His own victory, He called a group of chosen men to experience His victory. His intention was still the same as it was before creation. Now the Head has ascended. We as His members should join to Him in one spirit in our experience. Although He Himself has obeyed the will of God and has overcome the devilish power, He desires that we would represent Him on the earth, having a determined will to carry out God's will and resisting all the plans and acts of Satan. To enter into a spiritual warfare against the devil by prayer is the work that the Lord has called us to do. This book of Revelation speaks of the warfare between God and Satan, how Christ overcame him, and how the saints of Christ overcame him. Only those who understand spiritual warfare can do an effective work for God. Our every move should be a loss to Satan and a gain to God.</P><P>Now we will return to the text. Here we see how this Christ who is like the Son of Man is in the midst of the churches. This is the condition in the New Testament temple. The Old Testament temple with its golden incense altar, which represented the interceding Christ, and the showbread, which represented the twelve tribes of Israel, and the golden lampstand, by which they testified through the power of the Holy Spirit, have all been changed. Now there are only seven golden lampstands and One like the Son of Man: the church and the Lord Jesus. Here there is no one standing between the Lord and His church; the Lord is face to face with her. This Son of Man will soon judge the world. Before He judges the world, He will judge His church because judgment must begin first at the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17).</P><P>We should heed this point, that He is not interceding in the midst of the church; He is judging. He is not sitting in the midst of them to receive their worship; He is walking in the midst of them (2:11) to examine their conduct.</P><P>The Lord Jesus here is "clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle." This is the clothing of a priest. However, this is not the clothing of a priest at work. It is what he wears when he is resting, because this garment is very loose, hanging, "reaching to the feet." Furthermore, the waist is not girded with a girdle; the girdle is girded about the breast. The long garment here is what a priest ordinarily wore (Lev. 6:10), and it is different from the garment dipped in blood (Rev. 19:13) because He wears that garment only when He comes forth to judge. Though the judgment had been announced by that time, it had not yet been executed. This dress is also different from the glorious and beautiful dress that the high priest wore (Lev. 16:4) because at this time He is examining the lampstands in the temple and not coming forth to remove sins or to reveal the glory of His millennial kingdom. This garment is what the priest wore when he went out of the camp to examine the lepers.</P><P>He is girded with "a golden girdle." The Old Testament high priests were girded with a girdle that was only sewn with golden threads (Exo. 28:2, 4-5). Therefore, even though their ministry was established by God, it was bound to terminate because they were merely men and were bound to die. What our Lord was girded with was of pure gold. Therefore, it never loses its shining; it lasts forever (Heb. 7:23-24). The place where He is girded deserves our attention: "girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle." Ordinarily a girdle is girded about the loin (Matt. 3:4; John 13:4) so that the garment can be brought close to the body for convenience at work. To be girded about at the breasts shows that the work is already finished; there is no longer any need to be girded about the waist. After Aaron, the Old Testament high priest, finished his work, he entered into the Holy Place to change into his glorious dress. Similarly, after our Lord Jesus finishes judging His church in the air, He will be manifested in glory. The golden girdle also represents God's righteousness because when He comes to judge, "righteousness will be that which girds His loins" (Isa. 11:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verses Fourteen through Fifteen</H2><P>Verses 14-15: "And His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire; and His feet were like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters."</P><P>Not only does the Lord's clothing reveal the nature of judgment, He Himself reveals nothing less than the same. "His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow." In the vision Daniel saw, the Ancient of Days' "clothing was like white snow, / And the hair of His head was like pure wool" (Dan. 7:9). We know that this Ancient of Days is God. Here the description of the Lord Jesus by John matches the one by Daniel. This shows that the Lord Jesus is God.</P><P>"His head and hair were white." This reveals the Lord's full wisdom. Proverbs says, "The hoary head is a crown of glory" (16:31), and it also says, "The beauty of old men is the hoary head" (20:29 ASV 1901). Therefore, the meaning of white hair is experience, glory, and age. Paul says, "God is the head of Christ" (1 Cor. 11:3). Therefore, the meaning of the head here reveals the divinity of the Lord Jesus. Our Lord Jesus is the "Father of eternity" (Isa. 9:6, Heb.). "His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow." In Isaiah 1:18 we see that God promised to wash our sins so that they are as white as wool and snow. When we think of our sins having been cleansed to the extent that we are just like the head and hair of the Lord, are we not amazed at the Lord's grace?</P><P>However, there is not a crown on His head! The time for Him to become King has not yet come.</P><P>"His eyes were like a flame of fire." That is why He can examine man's inward parts. This reveals that in His judgment the Lord is never wrong. Fire causes the good ones to be clean and the evil ones to be destroyed. In the book of Malachi, Christ is "like a refiner's fire" (Mal. 3:2). When the Israelites are restored, the Lord will wash away their filth by "the judging Spirit and the burning Spirit" (Isa. 4:4). In the last day, when Christians stand before the judgment seat, the Lord will also use fire to test man's work, "for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one's work, of what sort it is" (1 Cor. 3:13). "So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts" (1 Cor. 4:5). "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad" (2 Cor. 5:10). Although we can now sin in secret and do things that men do not see or hear, yet "there is nothing covered up which will not be revealed."</P><P>The Lord's eyes behold the children of men (Psa. 11:4). "There is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account" (Heb. 4:13). Not only so, even today "the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him" (2 Chron. 16:9). Truly His eyes are like a flame of fire! Our eyes are dark within. We can only see things when there is light without, but the eyes of the Lord are not so. His eyes are like fire, and there is nothing that can hide from His face. Therefore, saints, do not forget this. Whatever you have hidden from men today will all be manifested before men in that day!</P><P>"His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace." Brass is the hardest of all metals. In the Bible, bronze has the meaning of judgment. Therefore, the wash basin in the outer court and the serpent Moses lifted up in the wilderness were both made of bronze. Bronze that has been refined in the furnace produces a fearful whitish color. The Lord's feet are like this. Whatever sin is judged by His sharp eyes will also be crushed by His feet. He will judge whatever is sinful to His eyes. His feet are "like shining bronze." How pure is His conduct! His dreadful holiness walks in the midst of the churches. How numerous are the sins that He condemns! Soon we will see His feet crushing Satan and everything that is abominable under Him.</P><P>His voice is like "the sound of many waters!" No one can resist Him. Men cannot control the sound of many waters. At this time, His voice is not soft and low as when He used to draw sinners to come to Him. Rather, His voice is now full of majesty and judgment. Everyone has to listen to Him. As the Psalmist says, "The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea" (Psa. 93:3-4). Ezekiel says, "And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters" (Ezek. 43:2). According to the Bible the sound of many waters signifies the majesty of God and His strength. Now this majesty and strength comes from the incarnated Christ.</P><P>The Bible also speaks of the power of the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ. He Himself says, "The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live" (John 5:25). Regarding His anger, Jeremiah says, "Jehovah will roar from on high, / And He will lift up His voice from His holy habitation; / He will roar mightily against His habitation; / He will respond with a shout like those who tread grapes, / Against all the inhabitants of the earth" (Jer. 25:30). Truly, "the voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty" (Psa. 29:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Sixteen</H2><P>Verse 16: "And He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun shines in its power."</P><P>The above is a declaration of the person of the One who became the Son of Man in grace. His lovingkindness and holiness never change. We love to meditate on His lovingkindness, but we also need to know that He is holy. God has given all judgment to this Son of Man. We will now look at His position: "He had in His right hand seven stars." The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches (Rev. 1:20). Whoever these messengers are, Christ holds them in His right hand. This signifies the total authority of Christ. He has total authority in God's work, in God's government, and in the church because the right hand in the Bible signifies authority and exaltation. Please read Psalms 16:11, 17:7, and 18:35, and Acts 7:55-56.</P><P>These messengers are all in the hand of the Lord. They love the Lord faithfully. Their function is to shine as stars. Being in the hand of the Lord, they are most secure. However, they also bear the greatest responsibility. We who love the Lord faithfully must not consider the work we are doing as being very great. We must remember that our coming in and going out are all in the hand of the Lord.</P><P>Another point is that these messengers are in the hand of the Lord. They are not on the Lord's head as His crown. This is because the time for them to receive glory has not come; they are still in trials. They must be faithful in order to shine eternally. Otherwise, they will become "wandering stars" (Jude 13).</P><P>"And out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword." The Lord Jesus is the God-appointed avenger. Isaiah 11:4 says that the Lord Jesus will "strike the land with the rod of His mouth, / And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked." In 49:2 the Lord Jesus says of Himself, that God "has made my mouth like a sharp sword." This shows the power of the words of the Lord Jesus, not only in the awakening of men's conscience to sin, but in the sharpness of judgment. "He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the word which I have spoken, that will judge him in the last day" (John 12:48). He will not only judge the world, but also the church because judgment must begin from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17). The first three chapters of Revelation prove that the church will be judged before the world is (Rev. 4-19). This "sharp two-edged sword" in His mouth has two uses. It is used to punish the rebellious church, the unfaithful branches. Revelation 2:12 and 16 speak on this point: "And to the messenger of the church in Pergamos write: These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword...Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth." It is also to be used to punish the stubborn, worldly people, that is, those who do not obey His gospel. This point is mentioned in Revelation 19:15 and 21: "And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations....And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse."</P><P>We have to understand that the Lord does not battle with the sword in His hand but with the sword in His mouth, which is His Word (John 12:48). Every sentence of the Lord's Word is full of power (Luke 1:37). Not only in creation or in salvation, but also in war, whatever He says is accomplished. This is the way with the coming war. Today we should battle with our spiritual enemies in the same way, by the Word of the Lord. Therefore, in our daily life we should let the Word of God dwell in our heart richly, so that the Holy Spirit can cause us to recall these words in times of trouble. We can then use these words to resist our enemy. It is a pity that many do not understand the meaning of spiritual warfare. Some think that spiritual warfare is wrestling against crime and people in society. Others think that spiritual warfare is to resist and fight against the lusts in their hearts. However, the Word of God does not speak in this way. Paul says, "For our wrestling is not against blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies" (Eph. 6:12). Spiritual warfare is the warfare between the people of God and Satan with the evil spirits under him. This kind of warfare is to prevent Satan from being victorious over us inwardly or outwardly. Whether the wrestling is with ourselves or with the world, we are fighting against anything that would allow Satan to boast. To wrestle in this warfare we must have the Word of God. In times of trouble the Holy Spirit will give us one or two verses of the Scripture in order that through these few words of God we may overcome Satan's attack and temptations. The Lord Jesus' victory when He was tested in the wilderness is an example of the relying on the Word of God.</P><P>"His face was as the sun shines in its power." Christ is the Sun of righteousness (Mal. 4:2). He once revealed His glory when He was on the mount of transfiguration. At that time, His "face shone as the sun" (Matt. 17:2). When Peter mentioned this incident, he considered this as a revelation of "the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" in His kingdom (2 Pet. 1:16). What happened on the mount of transfiguration is a type of the coming millennial kingdom (Matt. 16:28). Therefore, the meaning here is that the Lord Jesus will come again quickly to His own kingdom. He will be King on the earth, and He will cause the summer of the world to come (Matt. 24:32). Here we see that the emphasis of the Holy Spirit is no longer on the churches. His emphasis is on Christ obtaining His kingdom.</P><P>The sun is the highest thing in God's creation. God called it the greater light to rule the day. The meaning here of "the sun shines in its power" is that of a sun in the sky with no fog or cloud or shade. This is a proper illustration of the glory and power of our Lord Jesus in the millennium.</P><P>In the Bible there are two kinds of appearing of the Lord Jesus. They are typified by the morning star and the sun. His appearing as the sun is to the world, and His appearing as the morning star is to the saints. The morning star appears right before dawn. Only those who are watchful at night can see it. This is the position of the Christians. The sun appears during the daytime, and everyone in the world can see it. First there is the appearance of the morning star, and then comes the sun. Before our Lord Jesus appears to the people in the world, He will first appear to those who love His appearing. What a hope this is! We must distinguish between these two appearances.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>G. THE COMMISSION OF THE LORD (VERSES 17-20)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Seventeen</H2><P>Verse 17a: "And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead."</P><P>It took only a turn and one glimpse of this glorious Lord Jesus to produce such an effect. This glory was extraordinary. Whose eyes could bear the sight? John once leaned on Jesus' bosom, but because of this glory, majesty, power, and holiness, he fell at His feet as dead. When Christ comes to judge the church and the world, who will be able to bear such a sight? If John reacted so, what about others? Those unfaithful believers? The Lord's enemy? May all saints and sinners realize the solemnity of this forthcoming judgment!</P><P>Actually, all those who see Christ now should fall as John. Most of us just look at ourselves and others and still think there is something good in us. If we see Christ, we will realize our baseness and unworthiness. Before Isaiah saw the Lord Jesus, he was preaching the word of God. Six times in chapter five, "Woe to those" is mentioned. Chapter six, verse 1 says, "In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple." This is followed by 6:5, "Woe is me, for I am finished! / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell; / Yet I have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts, with my eyes."</P><P>When Job was being tried, he vindicated his own righteousness to his three friends and counted himself perfect. Then he saw the Lord, and he said, "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee: wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" (Job 42:5-6).</P><P>Daniel was a person of whom the Bible mentions no fault, but after he saw the Lord, he said, "No strength was left in me, but my color turned deathly pale; and I retained no strength...I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground" (Dan. 10:8-9). The prophet Habakkuk said, "When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself" (Hab. 3:16).</P><P>If we have truly seen the glory of the Lord, the holiness of the Lord, even the Lord Himself, we will be like the saints of old. We will deeply abhor ourselves and will consider ourselves the most detestable and greatest enemy. Both manifested as well as hidden pride are caused by our failure to see Christ. At any rate, we do not know ourselves. Self-introspection may be profitable, but it is not a perfect guide. The heart is deceitful above all things; who can know it? Without the Lord, even we ourselves do not know it. If we are not under the light of the Lord, how can we see with our own light? It is when we come before the Lord to examine ourselves that we can see our real selves. Those who think they have something or who consider themselves stronger than others are this way because they are ignorant of themselves. The Lord arranges and directs everything in our lives to help us to see our own total failures. How difficult it is for us to learn this lesson! We may humble ourselves a little when we fail, but when we are filled with God's grace and are successful in our works, it is very difficult for us to acknowledge that we are useless. How marvelous it would be if we could see the Lord Jesus all the time and unceasingly fall at His feet as dead! May the Lord's glory and holiness cause us to abhor ourselves so that we would prostrate on the ground and commit ourselves to death. Only then will the Lord manifest Himself in our lives.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verses Seventeen through Eighteen</H2><P>Verses 17b through 18: "And He placed His right hand on me, saying, Do not fear; I am the First and the Last and the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades."</P><P>The Lord's right hand of authority and His words work together (Dan. 8:17-18; 10:9-10, 18). "He placed His right hand on me, saying, Do not fear." Although He was in His glory, His love was still there! The Christ in the Gospels was expressed in this phrase, "Do not fear!" How much this word expresses the nature of the Lord!</P><P>This book speaks of things of the "great and fearful day of Jehovah." In that day, God will recompense men according to their deeds. Both the church and the world will be judged. However, there will be a group of people who know that the Lord Jesus loves them, that He shed His blood for them, and that He makes them priests and kings. Their spiritual condition will be the same as John's, and as such they will not be afraid. On the one hand, we know that the blood of the Lord Jesus has already cleansed us, and His grace is sufficient for us. We have already been saved and have eternal life. On the other hand, although we already have the assurance of eternal life, if we are not faithful, we will be ashamed and will suffer loss at the judgment seat of Christ. Therefore, it is always safe to be faithful in serving the Lord. If there is nothing between you and the Lord, then when you are weak, He will strengthen you. When you are fearful, He will comfort you. "But perfect love casts out fear" (1 John 4:18). The Lord Jesus desires to manifest Himself to us. However, we are like John. We feel that His majesty is more than His lovingkindness. It seems that the more the Lord manifests Himself, the more we dare not draw near to Him. Therefore, in His perfect love, He said to these people, "Do not fear." The question here is not what we are, but what He is. If we know Him, then we will know ourselves. The cross has already appraised us, but it is very hard for us to accept the judgment of the cross. The cross has also expressed the nature of the Lord Jesus, but we have not yet tasted such sweetness of the Lord. When the Lord appears in His glory, we will realize our own weaknesses, but more than this, we will see the greatness of His Person. This is the effect of the cross. However, the Lord's intention is to express what He Himself is. Therefore, He said, "I am the First and the Last and the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades."</P><P>What a comforting word! Although Christ is the judge expressing His majesty, and although the saints bear a serious responsibility before Him, John heard someone say, "Do not fear." Why? It is because the Lord Jesus, who is alive and who is the First and the Last, has become a man and has died and resurrected. "Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification" (Rom. 4:25). "In this...we have boldness in the day of the judgment because even as He is, so also are we in this world" (1 John 4:17). He has overcome Satan, and He has annulled the sting of death and the power of Hades. He is now holding "the keys of death and of Hades." Because He has died and resurrected, we should not fear.</P><P>Only the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus can give us boldness to stand before the judgment seat. Through His substitutional death and resurrection, we are delivered from the condemnation of the eternal lake of fire. Through His death and resurrection we are saved from the shame before the judgment seat. We should ask whether or not our boast is the Lord's death and resurrection. Everything else will fail. Those who are spiritually strong and well prepared are such, not because they are more advanced than others, but because they depend and draw more upon the Lord's death and resurrection. Here we can see the absolute need for a union with the Lord in His death and resurrection. The Lord reached the place of His authority through His death and resurrection. We cannot take any other way. "For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection" (Rom. 6:5). We reckon ourselves to be dead to sin and living to God in Christ Jesus (Rom. 6:11). When with faith we plant ourselves together in the likeness of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, we will make it. Our death is a death to sin, to self, and to everything that is Adamic and satanic. Our living is a living unto God and all His virtues. The Lord Jesus has already completed all of His salvation-both to sinners and to the saints. We need only to receive it by faith.</P><P>He is "the First," the source of all things; He is "the Last," the consummation of all things. God says in Isaiah 41:4: "I, Jehovah, am the first, / And with the last, I am He"; also, in 44:6, "I am the First and I am the Last"; and in 48:12, "I am He; I am the First, / I am also the Last." "The First" and "the Last" are names of God. This indicates the divinity of the Lord Jesus. He is before eternity past. He is also after eternity future.</P><P>He is "the living One." The Lord Jesus is life (John 1:4). He is doubtless the living One. This is what the Lord Jesus meant when He said in John, "I am...the life" (John 11:25). His life is not a created life; He exists forever. He is the source of life.</P><P>"I became dead." This is not for His own sins. It is a sin even to think that He has sins. This is for the sins of the world. The death of the Lord Jesus is "the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous" (1 Pet. 3:18). Through His death, He has given life to us. Oh saints, let us meditate more upon this wonderful death.</P><P>"And behold, I am living forever and ever." He is resurrected from death. Many people have met death and have died. They did not come back; there was no resurrection. God allowed Him to die and gave Him an opportunity to overcome death. Without battle there is no victory; without death there is no victory over death. He died and fought with death. He overcame it, and thus He resurrected. Death cannot cause Him to die forever. This proves that He is fully the living One. We can say that He has been "bench tested" in His experience to be the living One. Because He is "the resurrection," He is also "the life" (John 11:25). He is the resurrection; hence, He is the life. He resurrected for man. Hence, because of His resurrection, man can be resurrected.</P><P>"I am living forever and ever." There is only one death of the Lord and also only one resurrection of the Lord. He is living forever and ever. He will die no more, and He will resurrect from death no more. The Lord Jesus is God. For a while He humbled Himself to become a man that He could die and resurrect. Now He is living forever and ever. He has received back the glory of God which He had in eternity past, but now the glory of man has also been added. This kind of living is not only for Himself. We, the saints, are being "saved in His life" (Rom. 5:10). "He lives always to intercede" for us (Heb. 7:25). He Himself has promised, "Because I live, you also shall live" (John 14:19).</P><P>"And I have the keys of death and of Hades." Everything after this life is in the hands of the Lord. Death and Hades are put together in many places in this book. Chapter six, verse 8 seems to consider death and Hades as one following the other. Chapter twenty, verse 14 talks about the end of both. In both verses death and Hades are treated as if they are personified. We can see this in the New Testament. The devil holds the power of death (Heb. 2:14). Matthew 16:18 speaks of the gates of Hades. The one who is behind death and Hades is the devil. Therefore, when the Bible speaks of death and Hades, a personification is implied in the words.</P><P>It is of great significance that here the word death is linked to the word Hades. Death is related to the body, and Hades is related to the soul. Chapter six, verse 8 indicates that Hades receives the soul after the death of the physical body. According to chapter twenty, verse 13, death delivers up the body, and Hades delivers up the soul.</P><P>While the meaning of death is obvious to us, there are many things about Hades that many do not understand. In the original language Hades means the underworld. It is located in the heart of the earth (Matt. 12:40; Num. 16:30-33). It is separated into two parts: a part for the fallen ones and a part for the saved ones (Luke 16:19-31). The part for the fallen ones has burning fire. This is Hades proper. The part in which the saved ones stay is a place of comfort. The Bible calls it Paradise or Abraham's bosom. Hades is not the grave because man's grave is not in the heart of the earth (Matt. 12:40; Amos 9:2). Nor is Hades equivalent to hell or the lake of fire because inside the lake of fire (or hell) there is not only fire but there are also worms (Mark 9:48) and brimstone (Rev. 20:10), whereas Hades has only fire. What is called the bottomless pit, or tartarus, in the Bible is either Hades with a different name or part of a place that is sectioned into regions, one of which is called Hades while the other is called the bottomless pit.</P><P>Since the Lord Jesus holds the key of death and of Hades, He can resurrect those in them to receive judgment before Him. Thanks be to the Lord, for "then the word which is written will come to pass, `Death has been swallowed up unto victory.'" We have to rejoice and shout, "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?" (1 Cor. 15:54-55).</P><P>What we are looking forward to is not death because death is our enemy (1 Cor. 15:26). We are looking forward to the time when the Lord will come again. In the present age, the Lord is not recovering the original creation from the grip of death and Hades. Rather, He is opening a door in death and Hades and leading us to a place of greater blessing. "Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness" (Judg. 14:14). Our Lord is the One who brings forth riches out of poverty. How wonderful is His way of salvation!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Nineteen</H2><P>The Lord continued in verse 19: "Write therefore the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which are about to take place after these things."</P><P>"Therefore." Because the Lord Jesus is "the First and the Last and the living One," and because He "became dead," and is "living forever and ever," and because He has "the keys of death and of Hades," therefore "write." Because He is what He said He is in verses 17 and 18, therefore write to show forth His glory, and because He is what He said He is in verses 17 and 18, therefore write to declare the believer's responsibility and the devil's defeat. Since He was alive from the dead and is the Lord of all, He commanded John to write, and His commandment must be right.</P><P>"Write" is mainly for securing a written testimony. He did not want this message to be passed on orally because oral rendition could change His words with additions and subtractions. Revelation is the last book that He inspired in the Bible. He did not want to see that His New Testament would lack a book of prophecy. He told the apostle John to write it down to complete all of His records on the earth.</P><P>This verse speaks of the three sections of this book. What the apostle John wrote was a book of revelation. What is described in the book are the things that John has seen, the things that are, and the things that shall be hereafter.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The things which have been seen (Past).<br>The things which are (Present).<br>The things which are about to take place after these things (Future).</P><P>These are the three sections of the book of Revelation.</P><P>I."Have seen." This word is in the perfect tense in the original text. It means to have already seen. The Lord told John in the next verse (v. 20), "The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands." The things which had been seen are the seven stars and seven lampstands in John's vision. Here, John had already seen the seven stars and seven lampstands. In the previous few verses he said how he had seen them. Hence, the first section (chapter one) has been covered already. Now what is left are the other two sections.</P><P>II."The things which are." This means the things that are now existing. This covers the age of the church. A literal translation of verse 20 could be: "The seven stars are now the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are now the seven churches." "The things which are" are the things of the churches.</P><P>Beginning with chapter four, everything concerns the things of "the day of Jehovah." There is no doubt that we are now in the age of the church. The things starting with chapter four are not yet fulfilled. Hence, chapters two and three relate to the things of the present, or the things that are.</P><P>III."The things which are about to take place after these things." Chapter four, verse 1 says: "And I will show you the things that must take place after these things." From this verse we realize that "the things which are about to take place" start with chapter four. This is very clear. Since the third section of "the things which are about to take place" starts with chapter four, and since the first section is identified with chapter one, it is obvious that the second section must be chapters two and three.</P><P>The word "after" is meaningful here. It indicates that the third section starts only after the first and second sections have passed. The third section does not occur concurrently with the first or second section. Chapter three, verse 16 tells us that Christ will spew the church out of His mouth. He detests the church as His testimony! Therefore, it is meaningless for anyone to make chapters four through nineteen to be the church's history. The things of the third section will not start until God has given up the church. The first words of chapter four say "after these things." This proves that the things which are about to take place in the third section come after the current things of chapters two and three. Before the things of the churches in chapters two and three have come to pass, the things that are about to take place in chapter four will surely not begin. We can be in the third section only if this is now no longer the age of the church. As long as these past nineteen hundred years belong to the age of the church, the third section cannot begin because the second section has not ended.</P><P>Beginning from chapter four, the church age ends. The stars and lampstands that John saw before no longer exist. The Holy Place, which was closed in the past, now opens its door wide to reveal God's throne of judgment. The Lord Jesus was a priest, but now He is the Offering and the King of all things. The period of grace is over and the day of vengeance is at hand. The four Gospels and the Acts signify a transitional period from the Jews to the Gentiles. Revelation signifies the period of transition from the Gentiles to the Jews. It also touches upon the things of the kingdom and eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Twenty</H2><P>Verse 20: "The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are seven churches."</P><P>The stars and the lampstands are mysteries. Because they are mysteries, they are not just physical objects but carry with them spiritual significance. A mystery is something with a hidden spiritual meaning. Unless God explains them to man, mysteries are incomprehensible. It is not that mysteries defy comprehension. They can be understood, but it requires God's revelation. Since this book is a revelation from God, all the mysteries here are not total mysteries but are revealed mysteries. After all, there are not many symbols in this book, and of those, over one half have been explained. We should not consider this book as a book of mystery.</P><P>Initially we may not understand the meaning of the seven stars held in the Lord's hand. However, our gracious Lord explained it to us: "The seven stars are messengers of the seven churches." Most people do not have any idea who these messengers are. People's opinions are divided. Let us put away every tendency of argument and apply a spirit of quietness to study the Word of our Lord.</P><P>These messengers are not the men sent by the seven churches to carry back the letters from John. Although some may make this assumption, neither the Bible nor history has any such record. The earnestness of the Lord's rebuke and expectations of them in chapters two and three show that they are not traveling messengers, but rather people who are stationed in the churches.</P><P>Some brothers assume that these messengers refer to the pastors or overseers of the various churches. They believe in one man monopolizing the church business. I do not wish to argue here or to give rise to opinions. Almost all the churches in the various parts of China adopt this kind of "one-man system" with one pastor or one overseer administrating over a church. For the sake of God's truth and out of love let me apply some scriptural teachings to expose the shortcomings of this view. I pray for the tolerance of those who do not agree with my thoughts.</P><P>According to the Bible, the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers are the gifts God bestowed upon the whole church. In the Bible we cannot find an apostle for this or that specific church. Similarly, we do not see a pastor for this or that church. It is true that from the Bible we see overseers and deacons for a church. However, the overseers are plural in number, not singular. All the overseers of the church in the Bible are plural in number. These overseers are the same as the elders (Acts 20:17-18; Titus 1:5, 7). "And when they had appointed elders for them in every church" (Acts 14:23). If we say one messenger administrates over one church and that the messenger refers to the pastor or the overseer, and that consequently it is scriptural to have one pastor or one elder to govern over one church, we will encounter many problems. We cannot base the church's most important system on the interpretation of one debatable verse. Furthermore, the shepherds belong to the whole church, and overseers are more than one! I do not think that Revelation 1:20 carries this meaning. Speaking for myself, I dare not add in anything that God has not said.</P><P>Prior to this, the church in Ephesus had elders and overseers already (Acts 20:17-18). According to tradition, John himself was an overseer in Ephesus. How could the Lord command John to write a letter to John himself? Moreover, in the Bible we find examples of letters written to individuals, such as those to Titus and Timothy. However, we cannot find any letter written to a church through an individual. We can also find letters written to all the elders, the deacons, and to the saints in Philippi. We cannot find a letter which is written only to the elders and the deacons and yet was considered to be written to the entire church. Some thirty years earlier when Paul wrote to the church in Ephesus, he was writing to the saints there. Can we say that John was now writing only to their pastors? Does this not differ greatly from the first letter to Ephesus? Moreover, the word "messenger" is the interpretation of the mystery of the star. Therefore, the word "messenger" must be a plain word according to the Lord. If the word "messenger" refers to the pastor or the overseer, then the messenger must also be a mystery. The Lord would not use one mystery to explain another mystery and use an unknown tongue to explain another unknown tongue. If so, this book would become a book of "inspiration" rather than "revelation." We trust that our Lord does not make mistakes and that He knew what the word "star" referred to. When He declared the star to be the messenger, then the star is truly the messenger and is not whatever men might say it is.</P><P>We should realize that the problem of the church system is one on which God's children are least able to agree. We truly do not desire to stir up any argument here. However, we all have to pay attention to one point, that is, in every matter we should not act contrary to the Bible. If we are willing to forsake our own denominational concept and base all our actions on the standard, "thus saith the Lord," then we will not err. The Lord will show His way to those who are meek. We should have the spirit of a learner and a pliable will to allow the Lord to show His mind to us. While the cry for an indigenous church today carries such high pitch-and perhaps the church will go through a major change in the near future-may we understand what the will of God is toward the church so that we will not compound mistake upon mistake. We realize the fact that there are not many who are truly following the Lord. How few are those that are willing to leave the present denominations and go out of the camp to suffer reproach. Nevertheless, the Lord always has a remnant. Praise Him, there will always be a handful left who are faithful to Him.</P><P>The arguments related to church matters cannot be built on only one single verse, especially when this verse is full of mystery. This is especially true when the concept in question is not allowed elsewhere in the Bible. Lately, there have been many of God's children everywhere who consider it wrong to have Christ's Body divided. However, what is the profit of having the outward name changed to "the Church of Christ in China" while the system within is still unscriptural? If we truly desire to have the oneness of Christ's Body, there is no need for us to have committees and discussions. We should repent and cry to God for the pitiful condition of division among God's children. Instead of criticizing with our mouth, we should be those beseeching God with tears on our faces. Still, we who search God's Word realize that as time goes on, both the church and the world will progressively deteriorate. We cannot hope that the entire church will change, but let us first love all of God's children. We ourselves should not have any barrier of denominationalism within us. We ourselves should first be free from denominationalism in reality, in concept, and in name. May the Lord show us the way. My heart is poured out for all of God's children everywhere. I hope my speaking does not fall on stony ears. I hope you will forgive me for saying this.</P><P>Now then if this messenger is a real messenger, what kind of messenger is he? We know in the Bible there are two different types of messengers: one is the angels from heaven (Matt. 22:30, etc.) and the other one is the messengers from men (Mal. 2:7; 3:1; Hag. 1:13). Which type of messenger is referred to here, angel or man?</P><P>According to the general usage in the New Testament, messenger mainly refers to a heavenly spirit who often is charged by God to help men. Hebrews 1:14 says, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth for service for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?" The "salvation" here does not refer to our initial salvation from perdition to eternal life. It refers to the salvation of the sabbath of Canaan, that is, the millennium. Therefore, from this verse we know the messengers here are spirits sent by God to minister to us. In the same manner that Satan's evil spirits try to destroy us through their power, God's benevolent spirits are protecting us through their might. How our God is caring for us! Only when we realize this will we have peace even in the midst of various trials and danger. However, it is a pity that we are either ignorant of this fact or else we doubt God's care for us.</P><P>Matthew 18:10 says, "Their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens." We know that the angels that God sent to serve us are not limited to one. They not only stay with us, but for our sake, they always ascend to the Father with our prayer and descend to us with His grace.</P><P>In the Old Testament, we see that God appointed the angels to be the rulers of the nations. Although men ruled as kings on earth, God appointed angels to be kings in heaven to administer the spiritual affairs of those nations. Daniel 10:21 says, "There is no one who holds strongly with me against these ones except Michael your [Israel's] prince." Here it says the angel Michael was the prince of Israel. Chapter twelve, verse 1 also indicates the same thought. Not only were the good angels the rulers, but the fallen angels were also rulers of the Gentile nations. Therefore, besides kings on the earth, the heavens also have "the prince of the kingdom of Persia" and "the prince of Grecia" (Dan. 10:13, 20). This matter is very important. It is interesting and full of spiritual implications, but we can only briefly mention it here.</P><P>Our question is this: if in the Old Testament God sent the archangel Michael to be the king of the chosen people of Israel, while all other nations had Satan's fallen angels as their kings, then in the New Testament, would God not send His angels to minister and to protect the churches in all places? We know that God has sent angels to minister to individuals. Would God not also send angels to minister to the whole church? When we see God's way of redemption, we will answer affirmatively that God must have done so. We are certain of this. However, do the messengers here (in Revelation 1:20) refer to the ministering and protecting angels? Even though we dare not say they are not, we believe they refer to men as messengers for the following reasons.</P><P>If the messengers here refer to the angels, then how can John write letters to them? A human being cannot send a letter to a spirit in heaven. Also, if they were the angels, then how could they receive material things such as letters? The intangible spirit cannot receive a tangible letter. Another convincing point is that our Lord spoke to the messenger in Smyrna that he should be faithful unto death (Rev. 2:10). If this were an angel, how could he die? Angels do not and cannot die. With these few points, it seems to indicate that these messengers are not angels, even though we cannot say that this is absolutely so.</P><P>If they are the messengers of men, what position would these men occupy in the churches? To answer this question, we first need to see if the term messenger exists within the churches. Second, from the context of chapters two and three we need to see what position they occupy in the churches.</P><P>We have already said that the messenger must be literally "messenger" because our Lord used this term to expound the mystery of the "star." If a mystery is expounded, then it is no longer a mystery. Since it is no longer a mystery, it must be known by all. The messengers are just messengers. We need not give another explanation to what our Lord has already explained. After we understand that they are messengers, then we should ask who are called the messengers in the churches? The Bible is not silent regarding this matter. Second Corinthians refers to the two brothers as "the messengers of the churches" (2 Cor. 8:23 KJV). Paul also said in Philippians, "Epaphroditus...your messenger" (Phil. 2:25 KJV). Therefore, we can see in the Bible that there is such a title as "messengers" in the churches.</P><P>Secondly, what kind of people were they in the churches? According to the term messenger, they are the representatives of the churches. A messenger is a representative. When we read chapters two and three, we see that the messengers were those counted by the Lord to be responsible for the whole church. The Lord warned them regarding the removal of the lampstand. The Lord rebuked them for having held the doctrine of Balaam, and He reproached them for suffering the woman Jezebel. The Lord warned them that He would come to them as a thief. Considering the way the Lord dealt with them, we know that they were charged by the Lord to be responsible for the church. They represent their church and bear the responsibility for it. We know that the word "messenger" means the sent ones. The sent ones, in a practical sense, more or less represent the one who sent them. "He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who has sent Me" (Matt. 10:40). Therefore, these messengers were those in the churches who had the gift, the influence, the ability to turn the church. As to their work or positions we know nothing. They were the true members of the church, and as such, the Lord charged them to bear the responsibility for the whole church because they were the only ones that were able to hear the speaking of the Holy Spirit. Christ spoke of them and the churches they represent as one.</P><P>In these seven letters, our Lord indicated that there was a distinction, and yet no separation, between these messengers and their respective churches. We saw how our Lord wrote letters to them and counted these letters as addressed to the churches. The first sentence of all seven letters in chapters two and three is: "To the messenger of the church...." However, these letters were written "to the seven churches" (1:11). It is clear that the messengers and the churches are joined as one. These letters to the seven messengers were not like those private letters to Titus and Timothy, which were for their individual guidance. Although these seven letters were written to the seven messengers, we find the words "the Spirit says to the churches." Our Lord treated the messengers as the churches and charged them to bear the responsibility of the churches.</P><P>However, the messengers and the churches are not exactly the same. Therefore, our Lord said, "Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison" (2:10); "My faithful one, who was killed among you" (2:13); "you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam" (2:14); "I say to you-the rest" (2:24); "you have a few names...who have not defiled their garments" (3:4). The Lord had separated a few among them.</P><P>Furthermore, there are differences between the messengers and the churches: "I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place" (2:5); "you tolerate the woman Jezebel" (2:20). Although these seven letters were sent to the messengers, these differences were found only in the first four letters. In the last three letters, the messengers and the churches were exactly the same, and there were no more separate speakings to the messengers and the churches as in the first four letters.</P><P>These ones are represented by the stars. They are those who faithfully love the Lord, possessing heavenly position and experience like the stars in the heavens. They shine for the Lord like the stars at night. Their home is in the heavens. Their hope and happiness are all in the heavens. They have intimate fellowship with Christ. They also have the power and authority of the Lord because they are in the right hand of the Lord Jesus. They represent the church because they are the most faithful ones in the church. They mind the things of the church. They view the failure and success of the church as their own. They bear in their hearts the responsibility of the church. Every one of us can be a messenger of the church! The Lord will hold those who faithfully serve Him responsible for the rise or fall of their church. How solemn is this thought! Let us clearly see our responsibility. We should gladly bear the responsibility of the church in the presence of the Lord. In spirit we should resist on behalf of the church all the attacks and tactics of the devil. We should be on our knees with tears and with outpoured soul, interceding for the church of Christ. Although we know that the failures of the churches are not our own, it will be our failure if we are unconcerned about their failures. We should have an enlarged heart to include all the children of God, viewing their business as our business. However, if we ourselves are not faithful, then we will not only set ourselves in danger but will cause the Lord's heart to be sorrowful. If we are willing to submit ourselves totally to the Lord's hand and gladly bear the responsibility for His sake, not only will we receive unspeakable blessing, but the Lord will also use us to accomplish a great and immeasurable work.</P><P>However, we should know that God is just. He will not mistreat us. There were only two churches with which God was totally pleased: Smyrna and Philadelphia. The Lord examined them, saw their faithfulness, and commended them. To all the other five churches the Lord had words of reproach. For two churches, Sardis and Laodicea, the Lord had no word of praise. The general state of Ephesus was their leaving the first love. For that the Lord considered taking away their lampstand. The Lord pronounced a special judgment on the sinners in Pergamos. In the same way, He judged Jezebel and those who followed after her in Thyatira. Even though the messengers represent every church, they represent them only in their hearts. In reality the messenger is the messenger and the church is the church because there are differences between the star and the lampstand. In responsibility, the Lord holds them accountable. Anyone who cares for the church of Christ should have this experience. However, in the judgment the Lord will only punish those who commit sins. The Lord knows who belongs to Him.</P><P>We will just say this much concerning the messengers. Now let us look at the churches. "The seven lampstands are seven churches." The church is a lampstand; it is not the lamp. This is because the church is just a stand, shining forth the light of God's lamp (2 Pet. 1:19). The church is a lampstand and not a candle because the light of the church comes through the Holy Spirit and is completely dependent upon the Holy Spirit. It is not like a candle which burns by itself and which shines by its own power. It is very important to remember this. We should know that we ourselves are wholly under God's judgment. Whatever is out of the self cannot please God because there is nothing good within us. We must not be presumptuous in any way. Even in God's work, we must not use the abilities of our natural life. As the lamp cannot shine without the oil, likewise we cannot use our natural abilities to accomplish any fruitful work for God.</P><P>From an earthly point of view, we are insignificant men, but from God's point of view, we are vessels in the heavenly temple. Now we have our representatives in the heavens! The lampstands are already in front of the Lord Jesus! Now our spirits have reached the heavens and soon our bodies will follow. Although presently we are still on earth, in spirit we have already become vessels of the heavenly tabernacle. Soon we will be there as priests serving God.</P><P>With regard to the seven churches, which are represented by the seven lampstands, we should understand three things:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>(1) These seven churches were real churches existing at that time.<br>(2) These seven churches represented the sevenfold history of the church.<br>(3) The conditions of the seven churches exist simultaneously in the church's sevenfold history.</P><P>In reading chapter one verses 4 and 11, we see that the original intention of the Lord was to send the seven epistles to the seven actual churches existing at that time. Although we know that these seven churches represent the churches throughout the ages-we will speak of that in a moment-we must not think that Christ's intention was for us to wait until these two thousand years have passed and the conditions of these seven churches have all become history in the seven periods of the churches before He returns. Such a thought will only make man slumber! On the contrary, our Lord often spoke to these churches that He would be coming again and they must be watchful. "Become watchful....If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief" (Rev. 3:2-3). This kind of word proves that in those days there was already the possibility of the Lord's second coming. Also our Lord called these seven churches "the things which are." When He said "which are," He meant "which are." What He paid attention to was the present and not the future. So the things of the seven churches which the Lord spoke of were the actual happenings in those days. There was already the possibility of His second coming at that time! We must never assume that the Lord will not come and that we must wait until the fulfillment of such and such prophecies before He will come. This kind of thought is not approved by the Bible. Rather, this was the attitude of the evil servant, whose words were, "My master delays" (Matt. 24:48).</P><P>This is real. However, the reason that our Lord only spoke to these seven churches, to my mind, is because there was a deeper intention. The churches at that time were not just seven. In the province of Asia alone, there were a few more churches. Moreover, those that needed admonishing, warning, and encouragement were not just these seven churches. The well-known churches, such as Antioch, should also have received this kind of epistle, but our ever unmistaken Lord only chose these seven out of many churches and various backgrounds to receive His special exhortations. Are not all His acts full of significance? Our Lord knows what to do. Although these seven churches were actually present at that time and were in the actual situations they were described to be in, should not our Lord have had a greater and broader meaning in choosing them? Was it not His intention to select churches that would match the conditions of the churches in the future in order to reveal His will toward them (the churches in the future)?</P><P>After we read carefully over chapters two and three, we will see that the Lord's intention was to use these seven churches to reveal the general state of the church from the time of the apostles to the end of this age. We have many reasons to support this. We have said that what the angel revealed in verse 1 will happen in a short time. Would this not indicate that those things not revealed by the angel will be completed in a longer period of time? The message in chapters two and three is not revealed by the angel, so it will be fulfilled over a longer period of time.</P><P>Moreover, in the original text there is no definite article before these seven churches. This indicates that the Lord was not pointing only to these seven churches. They were but a group representing all the other churches. In addition, the word "seven" in this book is a very meaningful number. The meaning of the word "seven" is completion. Seven churches indicate one whole church. If we would turn our eyes from the seven actual churches on the earth to their representation in the heavens, we will be even clearer. The Lord Jesus Christ was walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands. If the seven lampstands were pointing only to the seven churches at that time, those other than and those after these seven churches would not be counted as churches! There were only seven golden lampstands in the heavens! Does this mean that churches other than the seven were not churches? Hence, these seven churches represented by the seven golden lampstands are the representatives of all the churches in the world.</P><P>Furthermore, at the end of each of these seven letters was written, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." There is no other place in the Bible where the importance of these words is emphasized like it is here. This word clearly indicates that the message was not written only for the people at that time. This word was spoken for those in the past as well as in the present, for anyone who has an ear to hear the Lord's word.</P><P>Also chapter one verse 3 of this book clearly indicates that this is a book of prophecy. If chapter four to the end are prophecies, then are not chapters two and three also prophecies? It does seem that we have the Lord's support in assuming that these seven letters are indirect prophecies, predicting the situations of the churches at different times. Just as John was a representative of all servants in that day, so were the seven churches.</P><P>When we look into these two chapters, we are surprised to see how the Bible matches church history. Firstly, the church in Ephesus was reprimanded by the Lord for leaving her first love. Is this not the case with the churches since the apostolic time? Not only was it so before the death of the last apostle, it was even the same afterwards. Smyrna's persecutions were also another picture in church history. Later, the church joined herself to the world, the persecutors were turned into friends, and a "Balaam" was hired to promote this kind of harmony. History and the third letter really match. Later, is not Jezebel's power, her fornication, and her filth a real picture of the Roman church era? The Reformed churches which were seemingly alive but were dead, the brothers who faithfully kept the word, and the lukewarmness of the middle-of-the-road groups-do these not show the experience of the churches one after another? Although we have only glanced over chapters two and three quickly, what we have seen already indicates that these seven letters match closely with the church history on the earth.</P><P>Now from our point of view, do we not see in a clearer way than those a hundred years earlier? The Lord was gracious to have had us born at this time, so that when we look back, we may know what has happened in the past. In this way our hope can be strengthened. Although the Lord has been delayed for a long time, one thing is sure: we are at the end of this age. We cannot tell how much more still lies ahead of us. We dare not say, but I am afraid we are already at the end of the way.</P><P>Nevertheless, our Lord did not explicitly state that these seven churches represented the churches in consecutive generations, nor did He state that these seven epistles are the history of the church in chronological sequence. If He were to do so, it would have caused His church to lose hope in waiting for His coming from heaven. The Lord Jesus never once told us that His church would be on this earth for another two thousand years before He would come back. Indeed, our Lord knew the future, yet He did not tell us the time and day of His return. Otherwise, we would not have the blessed hope. Even in the Gospels, the Lord Jesus indicated the same. In His words there were hints for His delay, but there was also hope for His soon return. This is the greatest help for those who are discouraged. It prevents us from living comfortably on this earth while forgetting the heavenly matters. Although He has not come, we are not disappointed because He has told us clearly, "Watch therefore, for you do not know when the Master of the house comes" (Mark 13:35). If the Lord said explicitly that these seven epistles were the history of the church, then we would lose our sojourner's nature and our lamp's oil. We would have no more heaven in our life on earth.</P><P>Although the conditions of these seven churches aptly represent the history of the church on earth, it does not mean that Smyrna came only after Ephesus had passed away, that Pergamos followed after Smyrna was gone, and so forth. After reading chapters two and three as well as history, we see that although the first age in church history corresponds generally with the condition of Ephesus, and the second age corresponds generally with the condition of Smyrna, actually in the age of Ephesus there were already the conditions of Smyrna and of the other five churches, yet the condition of Ephesus was more prevailing. In the age of Smyrna there were also the conditions of Ephesus and of all the other churches, but the condition of Smyrna was the most predominant one in that age. The church in every age also bears the characteristics of all the other churches in the same way that all seven churches existed simultaneously at that time. This will become more obvious in the last days. The Lord Jesus spoke to the church in Thyatira, "Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come" (2:25). He spoke to Sardis, "I will come as a thief" (3:3), and He spoke to Philadelphia, "I come quickly" (3:11). Laodicea is the last church. We have seen that the Lord Jesus spoke to these three churches regarding His coming again. Thus, they are the churches which will remain until His coming. These three churches plus Laodicea will certainly co-exist until the end of the ages. History has completely confirmed this, and we will soon be studying this matter. Let me again point out clearly that the Lord said to Thyatira, "Until I come." From our point of view this was not very imminent. He said to Sardis, "I will come." This was more definite. He said to Philadelphia, "I come quickly." This was even more urgent. Now, we are already at the end of this age. We need to prepare ourselves watchfully.</P><P>Hence, the last four of these seven churches will exist until the Lord comes. This does not mean that they were raised up together at the same time and then co-exist until the Lord's return. It means that Thyatira as a beginning is raised up first, followed by Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. They were raised up one after another. The former did not come to an end because the latter was raised up. The four will continue together until the Lord comes. In other words, they have different beginnings, but their consummations will be together. The first three of the seven churches did not have the word of the Lord's return. Thus, they were raised up to replace one another, and they came one right after another.</P><P>Moreover, we see that in the first four churches, the Lord separated the messengers from the churches. Other than Smyrna, which bore no rebuke, all of the Lord's judgments and admonishments did not concern the messengers themselves. In Ephesus it was the lampstand that was to be removed, and in Pergamos and Thyatira it was the unfaithful members that were to be judged. The last three were just the opposite-the messengers and the churches were completely united. Other than Philadelphia, which was without blame, all of the Lord's judgments and admonishments were for the messengers themselves. In Sardis the few who wore white robes were not the messengers but were ones who were different from the messengers. The messenger of Laodicea was blended together with the church. The explanation of such a difference may be that the first four churches still had the position of the church, and God considered it sufficient for the messengers to represent their churches. Thus, He judged and punished only the immoral members among them. The last three churches have lost their position and have become wholly corrupted. Thus all of them were judged together with the world. Because of this, if there were any faithful members in the last three churches, they should have separated themselves from the churches so that they could become Philadelphia before the Lord. Smyrna and Philadelphia were perfect. Thus, there was no separation between the messengers and the churches-the two were united. Sardis (in position) and Laodicea failed completely. Thus, there was also no separation between the messengers and the churches-the two were one. They have no hope other than of being forsaken by the Lord. What a lesson the saints who love the Lord should learn from this passage!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>SECTION THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>"THE THINGS WHICH ARE"<br>(CHAPTERS TWO AND THREE)</H1><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="400"><tr><td><div class="ital">Chapter Two</div>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Ephesus (the Post-apostolic Church)-vv. 1-7</li>	<li>Smyrna (the Suffering Church)-vv. 8-11</li>	<li>Pergamos (the Corrupted Church)-vv. 12-17</li>	<li>Thyatira (the Roman Catholic Church)-vv. 18-29</li>	</ol><div class="ital">Chapter Three</div>	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="5">	<li>Sardis (the Reformed Church)-vv. 1-6</li>	<li>Philadelphia (the Faithful Little Flock)-vv. 7-13</li>	<li>Laodicea (the Apostate Church)-vv. 14-22</li>	</ol></td></tr></table></div><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVEN EPISTLES</H2><P>I have mentioned that the seven churches were actual historical churches at their time. In addition, they also represent the conditions and history of all the churches on the earth at different times. Strictly speaking, these seven epistles were sent to the seven designated churches of that day to exhort the churches to hold on to their good works and to repent of their evil ways. Nevertheless, these seven churches also represent all the churches. Therefore, these seven epistles represent Christ's view concerning His church. As such, they form part of the prophecies. This means that these seven epistles are prophecies concerning the history of all the churches on earth.</P><P>Some have said that Revelation 2 and 3 are "a collection of love letters." Although this description does not fully represent these two chapters, it does reveal how concerned the Lord is for His church. These seven epistles are the last written communication from the Lord to His church. How crucial this is! But how few are those who would carefully read through these seven epistles! That Christ would personally and directly send these seven epistles to His churches indicates that they are of special value and deserve His servants' special attention. But how many actually care for the Lord's heart?</P><P>These seven epistles are divided into two sections. We know that at the end of each epistle there is a promise to the overcomer and an admonishing warning to him who has an ear. In the Bible the number seven is often divided into four and three, but in these seven epistles, it is divided into three and four, the first three epistles forming one section and the last four another. This division is as follows: in the first three epistles the sequence is first the hearing of what the Spirit says to those who have an ear and then the promise of reward to the overcomer, but in the last four epistles this sequence is reversed. It is very meaningful to divide the number seven into three and four in this way. Three is a number of God, and four is a number of man. This indicates that the church will fall from her position. At the beginning, the church had God's glory and grace, but at the end, she is filled with man's traditions and organization. Before we examine the prophecies and spiritual instructions of these seven epistles individually, let us first consider some general points regarding them.</P><P>(1) The recipients of these seven epistles were the messengers of the seven churches. As I have mentioned earlier, these messengers were not pastors of churches nor were they other officials. Instead, they were those in every church who were saved by the Lord's blood, who were willing to bear responsibility for the Lord, and who were serving the Lord faithfully. They had received gifts from God to influence and to build up the church where they were. The Lord regarded them as His lights; they were shining as the stars. The rise or fall of the churches was their responsibility. May the Lord raise us up to be the messengers of His churches! May we serve the Lord faithfully!</P><P>(2) In every epistle a different priestly title is revealed. Ephesus was a church on the decline, so the Lord revealed Himself as One walking in their midst inspecting His churches. He is the unchanging One. Therefore, the church in Ephesus should not change either. Smyrna was a church in tribulation, so the Lord revealed Himself as One who died and rose again, preparing them for martyrdom. Pergamos was a church with heresies, so the Lord spoke to them with a two-edged sword showing His judgment. Sardis was a church in death, so the Lord revealed Himself as the Spirit of life and as the bright shining star. Philadelphia was without blemish, so the Lord opened wide the door of preaching to them that they might have an enlarged work. Laodicea was a worldly church, so the Lord revealed Himself as One kept outside the door. Even though His church failed, He Himself still witnessed faithfully and remained as the One who is above all. Although to each church the Lord revealed one aspect of Himself for the purpose of exhorting and warning them, these revelations were not limited only to the individual church that received the epistle. They also served to reveal His nature in general to all the churches.</P><P>(3) Concerning the meaning of these seven churches, we already know that they represent all churches past and present. Let us now consider further what they represent.</P><P>The word Ephesus means "loose." At the beginning, the church had a very deep love for the Lord, but after a while, this love gradually cooled down. This was the condition of the church after the apostles.</P><P>The word Smyrna means "suffering." This was the stage when the church underwent persecution and suffered martyrdom. Christians underwent countless persecutions under the hands of the Roman emperors. In the church some had forsaken the gospel and joined the Jewish religion.</P><P>The word Pergamos means "high tower." During this time, the Roman emperor Constantine joined Christianity, and the tribulation of the church ended. The real faith was lost, and the church was united with the world!</P><P>The word Thyatira means "her untiring sacrifice." This is the age of Roman Catholicism. During this time, the priests became corrupted and the truth was covered by darkness. Christ's rightful position was usurped, and the church committed fornication.</P><P>The word Sardis means "restoration." After many years of darkness the church had her restoration. This is the time of the reformation. They returned to the Lord Jesus, but they were still weak unto death.</P><P>Philadelphia means "brotherly love." This was the condition of the church during her revival over a century ago. Christians were not divided into sects but were joined by brotherly love. They diligently kept the word of the Bible, the word of God's patience.</P><P>The word Laodicea means "opinions of men." This typifies the church today. She is increased with material goods, fallen in spirituality, becoming neither hot nor cold, and listening to man more than keeping the Lord's command. This is the age of the secularization of the church.</P><P>Prophetically, the conditions of these seven churches match church history perfectly. However, in actuality the confused situations of all seven churches exist at every stage of the church's history, only, at times the condition of one of these seven becomes more prevalent and more obvious than that of the others.</P><P>(4)Concerning their works, in almost every epistle, there is the sentence "I know your works" (2:2, 19; 3:1, 8, 15). The Lord knows every work, whether it be good or evil. Each church must bear her own responsibility-"I know your works." While Ephesus has works but has no love, Thyatira has both works and love, and while Laodicea is completely worldly, Philadelphia is completely godly. The sin of Laodicea is not imputed to Philadelphia. Every church ought to bear her own responsibility. None is accountable for others, and none can escape blame because of others. All will be judged according to their own works. Judgment is based on the individual's works. This judgment has nothing to do with salvation or perdition because here it talks about the matter of works. Works have nothing to do with our salvation (Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). Concerning the two churches in Smyrna and Pergamos, the Lord did not mention anything about their works, as if they had none. However, just as the Lord "knew" the works of the other churches, He also "knew" the condition of these two. Although they had no other works, the enduring of persecution at Smyrna and the martyrdom at Pergamos were the best works in the Lord's eyes (Rev. 2:9, 13). In these seven epistles, the Lord stated their works, their afflictions, and His view regarding all their works and environments. This was a precursor to the coming judgment seat of Christ. As the Lord judged His churches then, in the same way He will also judge His churches at that day.</P><P>(5)In every epistle there are the Lord's examination and commands. Even in judgment our Lord still exhibited His kindness. Although there were many errors and evils in His churches, He did not conceal their good works. On the one hand, He was just in exposing their sins; on the other hand, He was kind in revealing their merits. Moreover, He did not rebuke their sins right away. Instead, He first praised them as much as possible and then rebuked. Therefore, woe is he who receives no praise from the Lord!</P><P>The judgment of the Lord is just. He did not leave any goodness without praise nor any evil without rebuke. He mentioned the churches' loyalty, tribulation, poverty, faithfulness, works, love, faith, diligence, patience, good works, purity, and endurance (2:6, 9, 13, 19, 24; 3:8, 10). He also spoke of the churches' coldness, heresy, fornication, self-exaltation, worldliness, weakness, imperfection, being alive in name but dead in reality, being neither cold nor hot, wretchedness, misery, poverty, blindness, and nakedness (2:4, 14, 15, 20; 3:1, 2, 15, 16, 17).</P><P>There were two churches that were perfect and were without any rebuke from the Lord, namely Smyrna and Philadelphia. There were two churches completely in failure, having no praise at all from the Lord, namely Sardis and Laodicea. There were other churches that had many good works as well as many evil deeds. We observe that at the beginning the Lord always commended their virtues, and at the end He always had to reprimand them! Turning from praise to rebuke, the Lord often used the word "but." How unfortunate this is! "Although...but..."-such flaws amidst excellence! In 2:2-3 the Lord mentioned many virtues about the church in Ephesus, but in verse four He says, "But I have one thing against you...." In 2:13 the Lord commended the faithfulness of the church in Pergamos, but verse 14 says, "But I have a few things against you..." In 2:19 the Lord revealed the good works of the church in Thyatira, but verse 20 says, "But I have something against you..." All praises for us cannot conceal our slightest mistakes. It is indeed a pity that in all of our goodness we unavoidably find a "but"! May the Lord keep us perfect in Him, and may our "ointment" contain not one single "dead fly."</P><P>At whichever point the church of the Lord fell, there the Lord commanded them to repent (2:5, 16; 3:3, 19). The church still needs to repent! Saints still need to repent! We think that repentance is the means for sinners to believe in the gospel and that it is not necessary for us, the believers, to repent. However, repentance of the saints is spoken of by the Lord Himself. We wish that the Lord could use nicer and prettier words to regulate us, but the Lord says "repent." It is easy for the saints to talk about consecration, work, zeal, faith, and love, but the Lord Jesus says these are not enough; we ought to "repent." How humbling and humiliating this word is! Once a person has sinned, whether he be a sinner or a saint, he must repent. One may have many good deeds and virtues, but if he has not repented of the evils the Lord rebuked, he will receive the Lord's chastisement. Even though this is not eternal perdition, it is still quite a severe punishment. A saint ought not to consider his own good deeds so much. Instead he ought to repent of his own failures so that he can reach a state of perfection.</P><P>We ought to repent. This is the Lord's command and exhortation. If we do not obey His will, we will surely come under the judgment. "But if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent" (2:5). "Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth" (2:16). "If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief" (3:3). The Lord calls us to repentance because we have flaws. If we repent, we will receive the help, but if we do not repent, He will execute judgment. Therefore, backslidden Christians ought to rise up in haste! In these seven epistles the Lord is promising special spiritual blessings to the seven churches. If they want them, they can all receive them. Ephesus can return to the first love, Smyrna can receive the martyr's crown, Pergamos can recover the pure truth, Thyatira can remove Jezebel, Sardis can renew its vigil for the Lord's return, Philadelphia can enter the wide open door, and Laodicea can fill all her lack. The Lord has grace. Who is willing to receive it?</P><P>(6)Concerning the promise of the Lord to the individual overcomers, the Lord has warned, exhorted, called, rebuked, and commanded the church in general. However, who will listen to His voice? Although the Lord desires that the entire church would obey, He fully realizes that only certain individuals will overcome and will obey. There is no such thing as the whole group turning and repenting. For this reason, He promises great rewards to those overcoming individuals. Please see 2:7, 10, 11, 17, 26-28 and 3:5, 12, and 21.</P><P>After reading these seven epistles, one will realize the confusion in the churches at that time, but are the churches at the present time not in the same condition? I am afraid that the corruption of the churches today is much worse than that in those days. Therefore, now is the time for us to overcome. If we overcome, we shall receive the wonderful glory of the Lord's promise, but if we are unfaithful, we shall also face very severe consequences. May we, who have received abundant grace from the Lord, not be complacent about our salvation. May we care for our Father's desire daily. May we be separated from others in all sinful situations, whether they be in the world or in the church, and may we overcome as our Lord has overcome so that we may please God and obtain His reward.</P><P>These promises are special rewards from God. We cannot receive them if we do not overcome. The condition to gain these rewards is to overcome. We should not confuse overcoming with salvation. Salvation is through our believing in the redemption accomplished on the cross by our Lord Jesus. After salvation, overcoming is through drawing upon the Lord's grace daily and allowing His cross and the Holy Spirit to work in our lives with the result that we overcome sin, the world, the flesh, and Satan. A person who is saved but has not overcome can never obtain these special rewards and glory from the Lord. Every saint can be in danger of losing God's promise! How severe is God's word to Sardis and Laodicea! Even with Philadelphia the Lord still asks that she keep what she has! We ought to be careful or else we will lose our blessing. May the glory of the next age attract our hearts so that we may be willing to forego the pleasures of this life and to endure the scorns of this world.</P><P>These promises match the particular condition of every church. For example, the Lord promises Smyrna, the one being faithful unto death, that she will not be hurt by the second death. See how kind our Lord is! Not only does He give us the power to make us faithful, He also promises us the reward to motivate us to overcome. To Laodicea, the church which is most unlikely to overcome, the greatest promise is given in order that they might aspire to the coming glory. May we live today for the coming glory!</P><P>(7)In every epistle we find the Lord's calling, so that those who have an ear may hear what the Spirit says to the churches. All who have an ear must hear, and all who can hear must not disregard it. The Holy Spirit of God is calling us to be faithful servants to obtain the glory. Therefore we ought to listen. Otherwise, we will miss the opportunity for the reward. All those who are willing to listen should not only hear what the Spirit says to their own church but should also hear what the Spirit says to all the churches. We who have an ear must listen to all the speaking of the Spirit. To miss even one sentence is a loss to our spiritual welfare. Do you have an ear?</P><P>The above seven points are common to all the seven epistles. Once we understand the general overview, then we can study their contents in a more detailed way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>SUB-SECTION ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>EPHESUS-<br>THE POST-APOSTOLIC CHURCH<br>(2:1-7)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse One</H2><P>Verse one: "To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands."</P><P>"Write." John was the Lord's secretary. What he wrote down was just the Lord's words. Although today we no longer have direct inspirations from the Lord, we should be careful about what we write. While we are engaged in the work of evangelistic literature, we should first receive from the Lord the word "write." Our works will be worthwhile only when the language and the content are in line with the Lord's will.</P><P>"The church in Ephesus." We are familiar with terms like "the Anglican Church," "the Roman Catholic Church," "the Greek Orthodox Church," and "the Church of Christ in China," but the Bible is different. It says "the church in Ephesus." In the original language it means the church which is in Ephesus. Those in the church were but part of the people living in Ephesus. The Ephesians were still Gentiles. "The church in Ephesus" was only that part of the Ephesians that had believed in the Lord Jesus. The church was only in Ephesus; it is not an Ephesian church. Today, men try to establish Chinese churches because they do not understand the Bible. The church is only residing in a locality. It is not a product of a locality. This should forever be the church's stand. Once the church is joined with the world, it loses its qualifications!</P><P>Many people think that the Lord sent the first letter to Ephesus because the church in Ephesus was the head church of all the churches in Asia. However, we cannot see this anywhere in the Bible! We never find any man-made terms as "head church" or "mother church" in the Bible. The church of God is the Body of Christ, composed of individual members. It is not composed of many small churches. The unit in the Body of Christ is the individual believer and not an individual church. Believers are the members of Christ, being joined to Christ their Head by the Holy Spirit. No grand-scale union of churches as is found today can be found in the Bible. As a result, there is no such term as "head church" or "mother church!" Some have thought that the organization of the church in the Bible was not as complete as it is today. However, for us, we dare not add to or subtract from what the Bible has spoken and revealed.</P><P>In this way, "the churches" are the Christians gathered together under God's sovereign arrangement. These Christians constitute the church of God in each locality, such as the church in Ephesus. Furthermore, in the Bible the church is not just the Body of Christ, but the house of God, that is, God's dwelling place as well. There is only one Jesus Christ; He does not have many bodies. In the same way, God has only one home. He does not have many homes. For this reason, a local church is but the representation of the whole church of God in that particular locality. Although the number, spiritual condition, and other matters differ in different local churches, they are all representations of the one unique Body.</P><P>Those who are faithful in the Lord's service grieve much for the present church organizations and denominations, but unfortunately, they forget that one local church is but the representation of the whole church of God in that locality. We have, however, established many different denominational churches in one locality! From God's point of view there is only one "church in Ephesus." There are no "churches in Ephesus."</P><P>We have to mention another point. Here God shows us that the churches in all the places do not have any name. The Christians in Ephesus were merely called the church in Ephesus. The Bible only calls each church by the name of the place where it is. There is no other name. The church is denominated because of names. The word denomination in Latin means "a name." Whenever there is a name, there is a denomination. Hence, we must never have a certain church in a locality. We can only have a church in a certain locality. We will only say this much concerning the organization and name of the church. Those who will follow the Scriptures will receive guidance from this. To those who will not, there is nothing more we can say.</P><P>"The church in Ephesus" was a most blessed church. It had Paul, Apollos, Aquila, Priscilla, Timothy, Tychicus, and others working in it. It was very advanced in the knowledge and holiness of the Lord Jesus. Paul highly recommended them in his Epistles. The Lord did not send the first letter to Ephesus because it was the head church in Asia. There were other reasons for this. Ephesus was the first one to receive the letter, not because it possessed any outstanding characteristic, but because of its heavenly nature. When Paul wrote to the Ephesians earlier, he spoke of the high position Christians occupy: how they formerly had walked according to the age of the world, according to the operation of Satan, how they were dead in offenses and sins, and how they were made alive together with Christ, raised up together and seated together in the heavenlies in Christ to receive all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies. This is as far as the individual goes. All believers as individuals have received such grace before God. However, God's work did not stop here. Through the Holy Spirit He has joined us to Christ to become His Body. The book of Ephesians shows us the doctrine and position of the church. At the end it brings out the story of Adam and Eve as an illustration to typify the mystery of the union between Christ and the church. This book tells us that "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:25-27). How glorious such a doctrine is! How important it is! Of course this teaching is for all the saints, but God chose the Ephesian disciples as the foremost recipients. If the church at that day had not had the power of the Holy Spirit in its life, work, and testimony, it would not have been qualified to receive such a noble message. The spiritual condition of those in Corinth and Galatia and the Hebrew believers at that time did not allow Paul to convey such teaching to them (1 Cor. 3:1-2; Gal. 3:1-3; Heb. 5:11-14). Because the Ephesians obtained more special grace from God, they were able to receive this teaching.</P><P>At the time Paul wrote his Epistle to the Ephesians, the latter's spiritual progress was unmatched by any other churches of the day. However, the epistle we are about to read was written by the Lord Jesus thirty years later. By then the signs of desolation had appeared! A generation of saints had changed. Although they still kept their predecessors' tradition of zealous service for the Lord, they had lost the impetus of the zeal of their predecessors. The name of the place where this church was, Ephesus, also shows the laxity in love which would eventually come in. We would not be surprised if the church in Corinth were considered the foremost of all churches and were to lose its first love, but it is quite incomprehensible that a church as spiritual as this one would degrade into such a condition.</P><P>The first sentence of this letter also displays a kind of separation. Now it is no longer a letter written "to the saints who are in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus" (Eph. 1:1). Rather, it is "to the messenger of the church in Ephesus." How different is the first book to the Ephesians from the second book! Why would the Lord no longer send a letter to all the saints? Why would He only write to the messengers? All of our Lord's works are full of grace, but at the same time He is righteous. The church had degraded and had become a fallen one. Hence, He could no longer write with the same loving tone. Because the church had left Him, He had to order John to write to the messenger of the church, that is, to its representative. The Lord was writing to him and not to his church. It seems that the church was separated from Him by a long distance. The church had fallen into a very dark position. The Lord could no longer speak to it directly. The Lord could write to the Corinthians directly because although they had sinned, they had never loved Him so much and then afterwards left Him. To leave the first love is something most displeasing to the Lord. What a pity that from that day until now the church has not yet been recovered. Now God's house is fully desolated on earth. Our initial responsibility is to admit the fact concerning this. But then, His love has not changed. What has changed is His people. This detached form of address came from the Lord from whom the church had detached itself. It is because man has alienated himself from God that God is unable to draw close to man. This can be confirmed by the daily experience of the saints.</P><P>Some may ask, "Will the Lord then reject His church? Will the Lord forsake His saints? Who were these messengers? Why were they able to converse with God face to face? Were they officers in the church by whom the Lord conveyed His intention to the church, or were they specially capable ones through whom the Lord pronounced His judgment?" No. No. All those who know the Lord have to answer, "No." The messengers are not the capable ones. Much less are they officers in the church. The Lord was not speaking to the whole church. Neither was He speaking to the capable ones, much less the officers. If we put together the phrase "to the messengers" with the expression "he who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches," we will see that the messengers are those who draw close to the Lord Jesus. They are the ones who have an ear to hear the Lord, eyes to behold the Lord, and a heart to love the Lord. The Lord is still speaking to those who would listen to Him! He has not changed! Now all those overcomers who love the Lord must not only be saved from the world but must overcome in the church as well. This is because the darkness in the church has become as thick as it is in the world. Therefore, God's stars must shine. But then, how many are there that will listen to the Lord?</P><P>All the words of the Lord were spoken to those with ears to hear, for only he who has an ear can hear. The Word says, "Let him hear." This shows what great responsibility there is for those who have heard the Lord's words. We often wonder why it is that the Lord held the messengers who have merely heard the voice of Christ responsible. Why would the Lord rebuke them when it was only the church they belonged to that had sinned? How could the Lord impute the sin of the majority on the minority who have heard His speaking? If we understand this, we will have a clearer path before us. Ordinarily, we would admit that those who are in a certain office bear a certain responsibility. It is true that a believer who loves the Lord cannot change his environment no matter how spiritual he may be. We can never alter the general situation. The degradation of the church is not something that we can stop with our hands. It seems that our weakness may give us the excuse to shirk from our responsibilities, but this is not the teaching of the Bible. The condition of our companions is actually a reflection of our own spiritual condition. We ought to depart from sin and not bear the same yoke with unbelievers. We ought to purify ourselves from all filth and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. We are responsible if we take company with the filthy and the rebellious ones! Some may consider that if we go this way, our pathway will be too narrow and our work too small. Whether this is the case or not, however, we do not have a right to choose our own future. The Lord should be the One to chart our way for us. Not only should we be separated in spirit from the denominations and their sins, we should be different even in the outward name. "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry" (1 Sam. 15:22-23).</P><P>Rebellion is such a fearsome word! Although many times we are rebellious, we wish God would use a lighter word to describe our sin! Nevertheless, in this one thing the true self of Saul was exposed! Through that one sin, he lost his kingdom forever! How numerous are Saul's disciples! They obey God in many ways. Their disobedience happens in only one in a hundred cases. Even when they spare the sheep and the oxen, they do it for a sacrifice to God! When men rebel, they have all kinds of excuses. Even in rebellion they are contemplating sacrifices! When things are going our way, we can obey the Lord much, for it does not involve much price. But when we come face to face with the sheep, the oxen, and Agag, we are stuck. True obedience involves the denial of our opinion, wisdom, and love and the single-hearted practice of God's commandment in the Scripture. Even if we are despised by relatives and friends and are rejected by our companions, we should go on alone for God's sake. Let us wait for eternity when others will envy and acclaim our present action. For now, the smile from the throne is sufficient.</P><P>Here the Lord revealed Himself as "He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands" (Rev. 2:1). At the beginning of every epistle, the Lord spoke something concerning Himself. The way He revealed Himself has something to do with the condition of the churches. Here He spoke of the relationship between Himself, the representative of the church, and the whole church. He spoke of His full authority to rule over the symbol of the heavenly light and His searching among the vessels of His testimony. How easy it is for the church that has left its first love to forget this fact! Although the epistle was sent to the "star," the "lampstand" bore equal responsibility and will receive equal judgment. The Lord will soon judge the world. That is why He is beginning from the house of God, the church. These "stars" are the messengers of the churches; they are those who can represent the churches. They bear the spiritual responsibility of the churches before the Lord. They are like the stars in the sky, who give light and set the time. The faithful lovers of the Lord are the luminaries in the morally dark night of the world. These gifts and power belong to the Lord. Although man can organize the church, institute laws and constitutions for it, and ordain teachers and pastors, in reality these works usurp the place and authority of Christ! The seven stars are in His hand; they are not "in man's pocket." Only when the stars are in His hand can they bear the responsibility of their churches. Those who desire to bear the responsibility of the churches should first fall at the feet of the Lord as dead and should then personally experience the great holding and preserving power of His "right hand." If all the faithful servants of God, that is, those who have no offices in the denominations, would have John's experience in chapter one, the church would not have been as degraded as it is now. All those who desire to take up responsibility according to the Father's arrangement and for Christ's sake must have the preserving power of Christ's right hand. When the Lord wrote the letter to the church in Sardis, He called Himself, "He who has..the seven stars" (3:1). They are no longer in the Lord's right hand. The Lord merely "has" them. The Lord wants them to be responsible, but they have departed from the position which enables them to be responsible. However, here in Ephesus, they were still in the proper position, that is, in the right hand of the Lord. Only the Lord's right hand can make the stars shine according to His will. Many were the stars in the Lord's right hand, but through their mingling with the worldly organizations and sins and through their failure to draw a distinction between these things and them, they have lost their position in the Lord's right hand. On the one hand, the Lord rebukes. On the other hand, they have lost their right to be responsible for the Lord. What a doubly difficult situation they have put themselves into! But why do we have to fall into such a state? May the Lord be merciful to us!</P><P>As He searched the messengers, in the same way He searched the churches. He was not only "in the midst of the lampstands" (1:13), but was now the One who "walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands." Not only was He managing all the lampstands, but He was also examining their conduct. Those believers who have left their first love often forget that the Lord knows not only our speech and conduct but our thoughts as well. He searches our outward failure and judges our inward shortcomings.</P><P>Those who have ears will hear the voice of the Lord, and those who have eyes will see the way the Lord is taking in the midst of His churches. But then, how few are those who have eyes! Although everything in the world is under the Lord's hand, the Lord is not walking in the midst of the world. If we knew the Lord's way in the churches, how much we would then willingly follow Him! Yet this way cannot be seen by the physical eyes. Because it requires faith for one to follow, there are few who have become the Lord's companions. However, if those saints who are in the present-day church in Laodicea knew that the Lord is kept outside the door, there would not be that many who would take company with the lukewarm ones inside the door! May the Lord guide us!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verses Two and Three</H2><P>Verses 2-3: "I know your works and your labor and your endurance and that you cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false; and you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary."</P><P>Although the Lord rebuked the shortcomings of the saints, He tried His best to first praise them. How tender is He! How gracious are His acts! The Lord knows how to honor their good works. How these ones had worked, labored, and endured among others had not escaped the Lord's attention. The Lord also saw how they had hated sins and had tried the false apostles. The Lord also noted how they had saved others in labor, how they had worked with endurance, and how they were untiring in their good works. These merits were commended by the Lord. He knows how to pay attention to one's good works. How loveable is our Lord! Our Lord truly loves to speak well of the merits of His people. It is unfortunate that we do not have that many merits for Him to praise! Just as the apostle told the believers: "What things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things" (Phil. 4:8), in the same way the Lord loves to praise what is good in His sight.</P><P>"I know." How these two words pierce our hearts, yet how comforting they are! All the work and condition of His people are under His searching, for He is walking in the midst of the golden lampstands. Hence, we must never hide our sins, for "there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account" (Heb. 4:13).</P><P>"I know your works." The Lord knows everything already. This is why He can judge. It is only after the Lord has accepted a person that He will accept his work. Those who are not saved, no matter how good their works are, can never satisfy the Lord to the extent that He would grant them salvation. Those who have entered the church must be those who have been saved. A man must first be received by the Lord before his works can be accepted by Him. These ones have works. How excellent this is! How much work do we have before the Lord that can be called work at all? These ones not only have mere faith; they have works as well.</P><P>"Labor." How much the Lord commended Ephesus! Not only did they have the works, they also had the labors. To labor means to struggle to work and to strive to do something. Who has labored for the Lord in toil? Are we not counting our lives as precious? How many are there who are putting everything aside for the Lord's work? When we consider the coldness in the present age towards God's work, we cannot help but join in with the Lord to praise the labor of the Ephesians.</P><P>"Endurance." Their works, labor, and endurance refer mostly to their virtues in the church. The most important virtue in the congregation of the saints is endurance. If all the saints lived by themselves, they might not need that much endurance, but when people gather together, even if it is only two or three, endurance becomes indispensable. There are foolish ones. There are loose ones, backsliding ones, talkative ones, and rash ones. In a church, there are hundreds of opportunities for us to endure, but this is not an easy thing to do. These ones have endurance. No wonder the Lord commended them. Even the proof of Paul's apostleship was also endurance! Moreover, endurance here has the meaning of persevering. Many people, like the Galatians, are good at the beginning. Yet when difficulties come, they drift along with others and lose their faith. It is truly God's own work to enable one to endure. Man's strength soon vanishes. Only God can endure to the end. Furthermore, what is needed the most in trials is endurance, but the thing that goes away the fastest in trials is endurance. Among these ones there were the evil ones and the false apostles (v. 2). Outwardly there were the persecutions (v. 3). Their trials were indeed numerous, yet they could endure. This is surely commendable!</P><P>In particular, it often happens that in enduring, one subconsciously allows sinful things to come in, thus enduring sins as well. At least, it is easy to become forgiving towards the evil ones. How dangerous this is! There are few people around us who are perfect. Once we touch the evil ones, our spiritual sense can easily become dull. The conduct of the worldly people is not ours to judge. However, if there are brothers who have sinned, we have to excommunicate them. "Remove the evil man from among yourselves" (1 Cor. 5). This is the teaching of the Bible. Unfortunately, our endurance and love seem to exceed God's ordinance. God charges us to take forth the precious from the vile (Jer. 15:19). Yet we tolerate the vile, thinking that in it there are precious things also! We have acted contrary to the Scripture in being forbearing, loving, and enduring! The Lord commended the Ephesians, for they were not only enduring but would not "bear evil men." They had preserved their corporate purity. Even when there were those who called themselves as highly as apostles, they were still not afraid of them. This is indeed not easy!</P><P>"You have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false" (2:2). These false apostles are the ones Paul described in 2 Corinthians 11: "For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ" (v. 13). Before Paul left Ephesus, he had warned others concerning them: "I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them" (Acts 20:29-30).</P><P>After reading these verses, we realize that both the Lord as well as His church consider the apostleship the most important ministry in the church. Paul himself had testified to the church in Corinth that his apostolic ministry was received from the Lord. His setting up churches everywhere, his personal encounter with the Lord, and his miracles and wonders are all proofs of his apostleship. Please read 1 Corinthians 9:2 and 2 Corinthians 11 and 12. Because this ministry is so important, there were lawless ones who came in as imposters. These false apostles were there even before the apostles passed away. After they died, these false ones became even more numerous. However, the church did not receive them at the beginning. During the second half of the first century there were many such false apostles. At present, other than the Roman Catholic Church who still claims its pope to be the successor of the apostles, most Christian churches have conceded that the apostolic ministry no longer exists. The Pentecostal Church has apostles, but they, like the pope, are recognized by no one. When we see the cessation of the apostolic ministry, we readily realize that the Lord has suspended all forms of organization in the church.</P><P>"And you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary." This verse speaks of their work in the world. The Lord had mentioned their endurance before. Why was He mentioning it again? The endurance that was mentioned before was endurance in the church. Here, it was their endurance in the world. They were not only expressing the Lord's virtues in the church but were suffering for the Lord in the world: "And have borne because of My name." They saw that so many in the world were not yet saved and that the Lord had died for them. They sympathized with the Lord's heart for all men to be saved and strove to labor for the Lord's saving name. "And there is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). These ones were truly working and saving men for the sake of the Lord. Although they were faced with trials within and without, they were still tireless in their good works and did not grow weary through their suffering.</P><P>After we have seen the virtues of the Ephesians, we cannot say that everything they had was superficial and that they did not have any love for the Lord. Their virtues were approved by the Lord, and their nature was quite reliable. Paul mentioned work, labor, and endurance to the Thessalonians. He said, "Your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thes. 1:3). True work, labor, and endurance cannot be separated from faith, love, and hope. Since the Lord commended them, their virtues before the Lord must have far excelled those without any inward reality. However, they were still lacking in something.</P><P>If we stop here and the Bible did not say anything further, then we would have to say that this was indeed a perfect church. Which church today can be compared with such a church? If we consider the Word of God as our spiritual mirror, we have to conclude that the Ephesians were far better than we are. Wherever God's people are gathered together in twos and threes into His name and have become a church, they should compare themselves with this church so that they can realize their true condition. However, the most important thing is, although these virtues satisfy men, are they satisfactory to the Lord? Christ did not have much for which to rebuke them concerning their work and their doctrine. Their zeal, their defense of the truth, and their separation from sins were blameless, but these are not enough for the Lord to be satisfied. Although the Lord praised them for many things, He said further:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Four</H2><P>Verse 4:"But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love." </P><P>The Chinese Union Version translates this verse as: "But I have one thing against you." This softens the tone of the Lord and gives the impression that the Lord's rebuke was a light one. If we think that the Lord was only against them in this one thing, we may think that what the Lord was against was not something too serious. Actually, the Lord was greatly grieved. To forget the Lord's love and to receive this love in vain is not a small failure. It is all the more serious since they had tasted of this love. If they had left the first love at this point, would they not leave their present work in the future? The greatest degradation for a saint, and for a church as well, is to leave the first love. The first step of degradation a saint or a church takes is to depart from the first love. It is true that our Lord praises much, but He has a high standard too. Although He commended them so much, it does not mean that they were without reproach. Our Lord rebukes those whom He praises the most. His goal is perfection. It is not enough to have a good start. We have to go on according to the original condition and must advance even further.</P><P>Their traditional works and judgments were still there, but their motivating power was not as strong as before. A man can work as before while losing the original motive for his work. A church can be zealous and active outwardly, having the pure faith and the proper judgment, yet gradually losing the love which is the source of life. From the world's view and even from one's own view, one may be excellent and display no trace of decline. But from the view of the Lord who searches the inward parts and the hearts, the source of sins unseen by men is detected. Can a bridegroom be satisfied if a bride is faithful in all duties but cold in love? Can a person hungry for love be satisfied by good works and diligence? Can a love as great as Christ's be satisfied by cold activities and dry works that are void of a burning love? The Lord is jealous of our love! Love demands love, and short of it, no outward diligence can compensate for its loss.</P><P>The Lord Jesus had done His best to praise the Ephesians. This shows His love. However, He could not skip His rebuke just because of the praises. It was commendable that they continued in their works, but the firstfruits of grace, such as the denial of oneself and the minding of Christ, were gone! For this the Lord was against them. In the spiritual life of a saint, there is nothing that can replace a perfect heart for the Lord. If the heart is gone, what else can please the Lord? Can sounding brass and clanging cymbals (1 Cor. 13:1) serve the Lord? They had left the first love. The reason they could continue to work might have been that the work had become a habit or that the work might have retained a good name for them. However, a vain outward appearance cannot deceive the Lord. The Lord requires from us the very thing in which we fail. What then is the "first love"? When a man obtains a new thing, what joy there is! A new thing seems to have a special power to lay hold of a person and to give him an unspeakable feeling. How earnest a man's heart is towards the Lord Jesus Christ when he first receives Him. How grateful such a one is when he considers the pain and slavery under sin and Satan, and the salvation of the Lord! This is the first love. Man is prone to love new things and dislike old things. The Lord wants us to consider Him as the ever-fresh One. Many have shed countless tears of gratitude when they came to know the salvation of the cross. On the one hand, they condemn themselves. On the other hand, they marvel at the Lord's love. At such times, they are willing even to die and to be burned for the Lord. How intense the "first love" is! Unfortunately, such a condition does not remain long. When circumstances change, although one may not be completely dead towards the Lord, the initial virgin heart for the Lord is defiled and stained through enticement from the world and incitement of the flesh. Formerly the heart burned for the Lord and was sick with love. Now the heart is as dead as ashes and has lost the first love!</P><P>The first love is completely satisfied with the Lord. All those who are filled with the first love have one characteristic, which is that they seem to have been charmed by the Lord. "For whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God" (2 Cor. 5:13). The Lord told us many times that He satisfies our hearts. "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" (John 4:14). "He who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" (John 6:35). "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" (John 7:37-38). Those who are filled with the Lord's love are peculiar in man's eyes. They are not like those in the world. They do not care for gain or loss, mocking or rebuke. If we have gained the smile of the Lord on the throne, who can make us sorrowful with their frowning faces? Man can have the world. He can have fame, adulation, and glory. But what we want is just the Lord Jesus. This is the meaning of the apostle's word in Philippians 3: "But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ" (vv. 7-8). Because of such a desire for Christ, he was able to mind only "one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward" (vv. 13-14). How different is this kind of work from the work which is content with what meets the eyes! This is the secret of happiness! Since Paul was willing to consider all things as refuse for Christ's sake, the Lord surely rewarded him with a surpassing and extraordinary joy. Those who can refuse the joy of the world will overcome the world. The world is behind; the reward is ahead, and the feet are closely pursuing after the glorious way of the heavenly light. How can any person, event, or matter of this world attract us any more?</P><P>Now, as far as the church is concerned, the "first" love does not refer only to the love of an individual saint when he first believes in the Lord. The "first" here is not just a matter of time. This word is translated as "best" in Luke 15:22. In other places the word is translated as "the most" or "the first." The first love, then, is the best love. The "first" does not refer only to time but to the nature as well. The first love is not only the zeal and diligence of a new believer. It is also the virgin love the saints offer to the Lord as a result of His love. The first love of a church is the union in love between it and its Head. It is moved by the Lord's love to work and to serve. This is the result of the prayer of Ephesians 3:14-19: "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" (vv. 17-19). The first love is the love by which the believers single-heartedly turn to Christ through their gratitude for the love and grace of redemption. The cross is the birthplace of the first love. If we forget the Lord's love to us, we will become lacking in our love to Him. What makes us love the Lord is the love of the Lord. His love begets our love. His love draws out our love. "For the love of Christ constrains us,..and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised" (2 Cor. 5:14-15). When we trace back the source of our salvation, we will preserve the zeal of our first love. What we are lacking is not the love to the Lord. We have already had this love from the beginning. What we are lacking is the ability to preserve this love. In passing through the evil world, it is difficult for us not to be defiled by the dust on our feet. If we have the Lord's presence with us all the time, the basin and the wash towel of the Lord will do their work, and the pilgrim will not be defiled by worldliness. Only those who are before the Lord can preserve their love for the Lord. If we daily receive His ministration, and we daily draw near to Him, how can we become cold towards Him? If we do, it means that we do not have a personal knowledge of the Lord. It is a pity that many believers never have a personal sentiment towards the Lord. Their Lord is but the Lord in the mouth of the preachers or in the heart of their spiritual friends. They themselves have never fellowshipped with the Lord. Those Christians who know the love of the cross should keep themselves before the Lord and allow the eternally fresh cross to ever refresh and attract them in their hearts.</P><P>One thing which surprises us is that while the Ephesians were in such a condition of leaving their first love, they could still have so many activities, so much zeal, diligence, and forbearance for sufferings. Actually, this should come as no surprise. Although there are still fruits on the tree, they are not as tasty as before. They are not ripened in the heat of the day. The posture, beauty, and color are still there, but these ones do not seek after the love of Christ in the same way that they did before! The outward labor continues to be the same, but the goal is no longer the same! The danger for a saint is that he would not change his outward habit of loving the Lord but would lose his inward heart of the first love. I would rather see a person stop his first work after he has left his first love. If he does this, he can still realize his own failure and can still be alarmed in his heart, realizing that he has fallen and should repent and be recovered. The most dangerous thing is for saints not to be in the Lord's light, who, not having seen any light, assume that everything is just as before and that there is no danger of separation from the Lord in their spiritual life, not knowing that in the deepest part of their hearts they have lost the fellowship of intense love between them and the Lord.</P><P>The one thing I fear the most is that we would often forget about the Lord in our work; we would not know why we are working, laboring, and enduring. Although many works are of the Lord, for whom are we working? I am afraid that many times we work randomly and have not remembered the Lord. The Lord wants us to ask ourselves for whom the works are. It is a pity that we would work out of our habit or out of an intention to retain our fame, rather than out of the prompting of the Lord's love! In that day, when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, we will surely not be praised for the greatness or volume of our work. His flaming eyes will not be after those things. What He will investigate is how much of what we do is out of our love to Him. Only those works that are motivated by love are the gold, the silver, and the precious stones. No matter how great and numerous are the other works, and no matter how zealously and diligently one applies himself to them, they are but the wood, hay, and stubble. They have no use except to be burned. May all our works be done as if they were done before the judgment seat. May the degree of the Lord's judgment on us shine brighter day by day, and may it expose our intention.</P><P>Those who have tasted the Lord's love are in greater danger. When the saints are filled with the first love of the Lord, everything they do originates from their love for the Lord. They have no intention other than this motive. At such times, they feel that they can almost touch the Lord. They are willing to sacrifice their eyes and even their hearts for the Lord. However, when circumstances change, the enticement of the beauty of the world and the urge of the inner cravings subconsciously cool down the former zeal of love! We may still be able to do what we did yesterday, but the motive has changed. Although we are still able to continue with many works, there is no more stirring of the Lord's love in us. In many peoples' experience, they have not totally left the love of Christ. They still know that Christ loves them and that they love Christ. Yet this matter seems to be very hazy. It is like looking through a veil. The Lord's love is no longer as fresh and constraining as before. They only remember the Lord's former love in their memory. The Lord's love is no longer a present attraction. All of a sudden, the clear sky and the bright sun are instead covered by dark clouds! Of course, I do not mean that we should feel the love of the Lord in our emotion every day. This is impossible. But it is another matter if we do not care for the love of the Lord or for loving Him. The Lord's demand for us to hold on to the first love means that we should consider His love to be forever fresh. Although it pleases Him for us to love Him and to taste of His love once, this will not satisfy Him. In the same way a couple begins their marriage with love, the Lord wants us to continue in this kind of love. To borrow a human expression, the Lord wants us to have an eternal "honeymoon" with Him. The many works, labor, and endurance will not satisfy Him. Even perfect works, labor, and endurance, unless they are done in His love, will not be approved by Him either.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Five</H2><P>Verse 5:"Remember therefore where you have fallen from and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent."</P><P>The Lord did not abandon them and leave them to desolation. He wanted them to remember from where they had fallen. He wanted them to remember their former condition and weep for their present situation. He wanted them to lament saying, "I wish I could be like I was!" or "I wish I could return to the condition of a few months ago!" The remembrance of one's former condition will stir up in him repentance and aspiration. This is the first step towards revival. The remembrance of one's former experience will recover one's former position. A fallen saint cannot skip the step of "remembering."</P><P>"Remember therefore where you have fallen from." A perfect church in man's view is but a "fallen" church in the Lord's evaluation! Although the Lord praised their many activities, He could not help but call them the fallen ones! Our position before the Lord does not depend on how much we labor but on how much we have loved. Of course, when we have the love, we will have the labor also. No matter how much we work, if we have lost the love to the Lord, we are a fallen one. Adam had fallen. Israel had also fallen. It is a pity that even the church that has received God's grace and blessing has also fallen! However, God still gave them the chance. Hence, we should "remember therefore where [we] have fallen from."</P><P>The most important thing for a fallen Christian to do is to examine under God's light from where he has fallen. If we have not recovered the lost ground, even though our outward work may continue to be the same, our spiritual condition has already suffered a great blow. If a failure is not confessed before the Lord and cleansed by the blood, we may make further outward progress, but our years will be spent in vain. From where we have fallen, there we should return and should renew our onward journey. Our life after the fall is a journey in vain and is not reckoned by God unless we return back to the point of the fall and resume our walk from there. From where we fall, to there we must turn. The unfortunate thing is that after the saints have fallen, they still carry on with their activities. They do not realize that the foundation of their love to the Lord has been shaken already! In recalling the nature of our fall and the line from where we have backslidden, we should return to the starting point. This is the most important teaching in the Bible. This is true with individuals; it is also true with the church. If we want to know the true condition of the church today, we have to compare it with the apostolic church at the time of Pentecost. By this we will see if the church has degraded or advanced. As Ephesus had to remember from where it had fallen, in the same way the church today and the saints in it should not skip this step.</P><P>"And repent!" Amazing word! Does the church need to repent? There is a big difference between the repentance of the world and the repentance of the church. The latter has been washed by the blood and regenerated by the Holy Spirit. It does not need to repent of its dead works like the worldly people do. For the church, it is a matter of defilement in life and a loss in the love to the Lord. For this it has to return to its former position. Among the seven churches, the Lord charged five to repent! Repentance is a common need among the saints. It is easy to work busily and have enduring labor, but repentance is the most difficult thing for us to have. It is also the thing that we dislike the most. Although works of beating the air are exhausting, nevertheless, they do not require one to humble himself. It is therefore still bearable to the flesh. In addition, it wins a good name for a man. To confess one's mistakes and to repent of one's sin, on the other hand, will rob the flesh of its ground for exercise and will strip it of its glory. It even requires that one lay aside his own face and others' praises. How difficult this is! It is not that we are reluctant to serve the Lord, but we would much rather serve the Lord in a way that would not require us to do something that is too humiliating for us and which would sacrifice the achievements that we boast in. This kind of repentance is too embarrassing for us! It is alright for the sinners to do this, but for a saint to do this is too unsettling to his self-righteous heart! But then, the cross is not something up to our choice. Our duty is to be children of submission and slaves of obedience. Empty works may gain for us some adulation from man, but if they do not please the Lord, what profit is there? If the heart of our beloved Lord is not satisfied, even though we may have absolute contentment, we should relinquish it. If the saints were willing to have the same view as the Lord, there would not be so little repentance as there is today! If the heart of the Lord in the Holy Place is not satisfied, even if there are works that please others and oneself, we must ask for whom are these works done? If by the grace of God we would understand the Lord's view and would look at our present work from the view of eternity, we will realize the emptiness of our work and will esteem the value of pleasing the Lord. Of course, when we realize our lack in this way, we cannot help but be sorrowful in heart and repentant in spirit. However, the price of this self-humiliation and renunciation of glory is not small!</P><P>"Do the first works." This is the result of repentance. Without repentance there will not be a self-condemning heart. Without a self-condemning heart, we will remain in oldness and will not be renewed. If there is repentance, there must not only be the recovery of the first feeling, but the doing of the first works. What is it to do the first works? It must not be merely outward "works," for the Ephesians had that already. Neither must it be "labor," for the Ephesians have that also. It is not "endurance" either because they also have this. It is not being zealous to oppose sin. It is not being bold to try the falsehood. Neither is it suffering untiringly for Christ's name sake. All these are excellent in God's eyes and are acceptable, and the Ephesians had all these already. But the Lord Jesus went on to say that He had something against them, which was that they had left their first love. Hence, what is it to "do the first works"? Why did the Lord ask them to do the first works? Were not their works acceptable and praised already? If they were not the works the Lord praised, what then were the "first works"? Outwardly speaking, the first works are not much different from the former works of the Ephesians, but there is a difference in the motivating power and the goal. The works are the same, but the power that motivates the works is different. The "first love" is the same work with different motives. The "first works" are works that issue from the "first love." Although a saint's work may be exactly the same now as before, a difference in the inward motive will result in God's rebuke or praise. A work that issues from a heart filled with the zeal of the Lord's love is precious in the Lord's eyes. Concerning this He has no rebuke. Although a work that only satisfies the eyes presents no difference to others outwardly, it is not pleasing to the Lord who searches the heart of man. God's eyes are on our motive, and He judges accordingly. In the future at the judgment seat, many saints will be surprised at the amount of wood, hay, and stubble they possess. To them, all these works are important and valuable. How is your motive? This is the standard of God's judgment. All works that are not done out of love to the Lord, though they may be as numerous, perfect, and great as that of the Ephesians, are bound to be condemned. All other works are naturally even worse.</P><P>After we have read the book of Ephesians, we will see the relationship between "the first love" and "the first works": "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love" (4:15-16). These are the "first works" that parallel the "first love." The "first works" are not what man praises or sees. They are works in secret, like the works done by the "joints." The works considered precious by the Lord are not those that are outwardly great or important, but those that actually build up the Body of Christ "in love." This is the truly effective work. Without the intention of love there is no work of love. Because there is the love of the Lord Jesus, all the works become works for the building up of the church, and there will be the fitting and the knitting in harmony, and no dissension of opinions will be brought in. Although the church has now left its first love and has not done its first works, we can still be joined to the Head and can grow into Him in all things, from whom we will receive the supply and the strength. All those who have received the power of love from the Head can do the "first works." At present, we see the desolation of the church. Both the first love and the first works are all gone. This is the time for us to bow down before God, to humble ourselves and to confess our sins. The Lord calls us to repentance. The door of grace is still wide open. We should come quickly. Thank the Lord. He has shown us that many saints are willing to leave all organizations and are willing not only to hold fast to the first love but to revive the first works. How sad a thing it is that the church, including the saints, have left the first love and must now repent! Of course, the sadder thing is that some would not even repent after their fall. How did the church fall to such an extent? Paul saw the danger among the Ephesians from the very beginning. Hence, he had the prayer in Ephesians 3:14-19. It is easy for a Christian to love the Lord in an instant. In the real church most people have the experience of the first love, but how many are there that continue daily to be burning? I am afraid that many who loved the Lord a few years ago have now gradually become cold. Why is this the case? Paul's prayer gives the reason for this fall: "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love" (v. 17). Anything that does not have a foundation will not last forever. If our love is like the tree that has roots or the house on the ground, this love will be the "first love" all the time. What is this root and ground? It is Christ making "His home in your hearts." This is the source for the love to be rooted and grounded. Our greatest danger is to have much spiritual knowledge without the experience of Christ living in our hearts. Paul prayed for the Ephesians this way because they did not have this experience. They had received God's love (1:5-8), but this love had not been rooted and grounded in their hearts. Hence, Paul prayed for them. Is Christ really making home in our hearts? We should not answer this question rashly. We must not conjecture or assume that we have it already. This question should drive us to pray in the closet. How can Christ make home in our heart? The Bible is not silent concerning this. "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith" (3:17). When we receive the Lord Jesus Christ with a definite faith and allow Him to make home in our heart, our love will be rooted and grounded, and we will "be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth" (v. 18). When the Lord of love makes home in us, we will realize the measure of love. "And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ" (v. 19). The passing of time only manifests the unchanging love of the Lord. Christ's making home in our heart is not a temporary thing. Therefore, when we have this, we will not leave the love. I believe we have tasted and touched the Lord's love, but does not our heart hope for a more stable and steady spiritual condition? Is not a life of abiding in the Lord's house a wonderful one? May Christ become our satisfaction and our protection.</P><P>Thank and praise the Lord. This kind of blessing is not only reserved for those Christians who have reached the far end or the finishing line of their journey. Rather, it was there from the beginning. This love is the "first" love. These works are the "first" works. A young believer can just as easily obtain this grace. Other than Christ making home in our hearts, there is no other thing that can satisfy our hearts. "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" (John 4:13-14). The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of this age are all of this world. Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, but the fact that it will make man thirst again makes more drinkers come back. The world binds people with its vexations, but God is to be blessed because when we drink by faith of the water that the Lord gives, He fully satisfies us.</P><P>How good it would be if we have never left the Lord's love! If we have, we must remember where we "have fallen from and repent and do the first works." If we see that the Lord loves us deeply, we will surely humble ourselves in ashes and confess our failures. But there is something to rejoice for: He is gracious. Surely we feel remorseful when we consider our failures; our testimony for Him is weak and shaky. However, in Him we can still rejoice because in Him there is no failure. If we trust in His love, come near to Him, and confess our sins in a penitent way, He will not turn us back empty-handed but will grant us His strength and blessing. A vain reminiscence of our failure will not give us the strength to do the first works, but if we call on the Lord who delivers us, our victory will be assured. Humility is what we should have. However, it is the Lord who can revive us.</P><P>After this, there were the Lord's warnings. Because the church had left its first love and was no longer doing its first works, the Lord had to say: "But if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place." How severe this is! If the Lord's own words of encouragement and rebuke cannot cause you to repent, nothing will change your failure and degradation anymore! Other than judgment, there will not be any further way left for love.</P><P>We have to realize that the church will be judged in this age and will lose its illuminating power and position. Whenever the spiritual power is gone, God's judgment follows. The Lord leaves the church on earth as a testimony for the Lord Jesus. Hence, it is symbolized by the lampstand, something that shines in the moral darkness of the world. The church should testify of the Lord's past works, His present position, and His future glory. It is a golden lampstand. Therefore, it should have the nature of gold. If it does not testify of this or is not worthy of this testimony, it will be a false testimony, and the end is rejection by God. God can be patient. Thank Him that He was indeed patient. He can exhort the church to repent. Thank Him that He did exhort it to repent. However, no matter how great God's patience is, if the church does not repent, the end is sure. If God's exhortation falls on deaf ears, the lampstand will be removed, and the church will no longer be able to be God's light in the world. At any rate, the first position cannot be lost. Otherwise, God's glory and truth will suffer loss, and the ministry of the church as a testimony will be annulled. The safe place for a saint to be is one that abides close to Christ. If a church works faithfully at the beginning but loses its love later, it may still reject sin and corruption for a while, but it has already fallen into a dangerous position. The unique way of salvation is to repent and do the first works. Otherwise, although desolation may not appear right away, its coming is unavoidable. For the Lord to remove the church's lampstand does not mean that from now on it has no more outward activities or moves. It merely means that it can no longer be God's faithful testimony. Although the outward works may still go on, they are not what the Lord is after. Of course, He desires to have a true, pure, and faithful testimony, but what He is after is the heart of the church.</P><P>This is not only true with the church. It is also true with individual saints. God's intention is to perfect us. Those worldly and unfaithful believers should allow these words to deeply pierce their hearts. Since their walk is completely worldly, they are not able to speak to others concerning their Savior. They can say something, but what they speak will not have any power because the Holy Spirit will not work with them. Through their greed, selfishness, love for the world, and pursuit of fashion, they have lost their qualification to exercise their gifts. Their opportunity is gone, and there is no longer a reward reserved for them in heaven. On the day of the judgment, such people will not be able to stand before the Lord boldly and unabashed. When such a one stands before the judgment seat to give an account of what he has done in his body, he will suffer loss. Although he will be saved, his salvation will be as through fire. God has not called us to receive salvation only, but to testify for His Son. This is very important. However, the greatest goal of God in calling us is for us to be constituted with all the saved ones throughout the generations a bride for His Son. This should be the center of our thoughts. It should be the sweetest thought to us. His will is that we can be as the psalmist who said, "Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee" (Psa. 73:25). His greatest delight is the single-hearted love from His people as a response to His personal, sacrificial, and perfect love. His hope is that His people would take no other as their goal on earth except Himself, that they would maintain a virgin heart for Him, and that they would depart from the world and its customs. He is full of love towards us. At least, in the past, He has proved the sincerity and intensity of His love. But what is our response?</P><P>"Remove your lampstand out of its place." This only means that the position is lost and that one can no longer be a testimony for the Lord. This does not mean eternal perdition. All those who have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior will never perish. Once a person is saved, he is eternally saved, but what a pity it is that many are merely saved. Not only are they useless in the hands of the Lord, but they have grieved the Lord's heart through their coldness. How numerous are the churches today that have lost their nature and qualification as a lampstand! A church that has not recovered its first love for the Lord cannot be a true testimony for God. We must never forget our personal problem. What is the condition of the church we are in? Is it like Ephesus? God has many praises for Ephesus. Can He apply the same praises to our church? This will turn us to much self-examination. If a church has lost its first love and its testimony as a lampstand, in the eyes of the Lord it is no longer a church but has become a worldly organization and a society controlled by man's regulations. Man may consider it a great society, but what is God's valuation? The removal of a lampstand is something that is not seen by man's eyes, for it is something the Lord does in the heavenly tabernacle. According to the worldly view, there is no change between the time the lampstand is removed and the time when it was still there, but actually, before God, its position is lost. When the Lord Jesus forsook the temple in Jerusalem, He no longer called it His Father's house, but "your house," which was to be left desolate (Matt. 23:38). However, at that time, the white stones and the gold were still shining brightly there! Only a spiritual sight can detect the desolation behind the prosperity. Although the Lord did not say that He would blow out the lamp, when the lampstand is removed, the lamp will surely be darkened. Without the preservation of God's grace, a church will lose her testimony.</P><P>This first letter sets the tone for all seven letters. It is not written as a testimony to God's grace. It does not speak of God's love in caring, protecting, and comforting His saints. On the contrary, these seven epistles examine how the saints' walk matches the grace of their calling. Prior to this, God has shown forth His grace and love already. Everything that the saints need in life and work has been prepared. God is no longer declaring what He has declared. He is assuming that His people have received His grace and love already. For this reason, He requires of His people a life and walk worthy of their calling. Everything that comes short of this standard will be rebuked. The Lord searched their past works and spoke to them either words of praise or words of rebuke. The Lord also spoke of their future position, and their exaltation or humiliation will also be based on their future works. These seven epistles were not written with the purpose of preaching the Lord's grace but of judging the saints' conduct. It is true that our salvation is guaranteed and that there is no problem related to it. However, our position in the kingdom depends fully on the faithful work we do now in response to the constraining of the Lord's love.</P><P>After we have read these words, do not our hearts marvel? Before the apostle John passed away, is it not true that the church was still at its age of infancy and was at its prosperous period? However, the Lord condemned it and judged it as having fallen and rejected it! Actually, we have seen this in the New Testament already. Revelation is only a manifestation of the Lord's judgment. Paul's first Epistle was the Epistle to the Thessalonians. At that time, he already pointed out that "the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating" and that the apostasy will come (2 Thes. 2:7, 3). After this, he wrote 1 and 2 Corinthians. At that time, sin "that does not even occur among the Gentiles" had already appeared in the church (1 Cor. 5:1). First, there was the division and the sectarianism (1 Cor. 1:11-12; 3:3-4). Next, there was the denial of resurrection (1 Cor. 15:12). Finally, there were the Galatians who were "so quickly removing from Him who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel" (Gal. 1:6). They had left the freedom in Christ and were again being bound by the enslaving yoke of the law. Then there were the Romans, to whom the apostle had to say, "Now I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them. For such men do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own stomach, and through smooth words and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple" (16:17-18). Further, we see Paul writing to the Philippians from the prison in Rome: "For all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus" (2:21). They were "the enemies of the cross of Christ" (3:18). Finally, when he wrote to Timothy, he said, "At my first defense no one was with me to support me, but all abandoned me" (2 Tim. 4:16). Not only did those in Rome abandon him, but the whole of Asia as well. "All who are in Asia turned away from me" (1:15). Hence, all those who desire to be vessels of honor, sanctified, and useful to the master have to cleanse themselves from the dishonorable ones. The original text here refers to the people, that is, the sinners in "the great house," which is the church. In the last days, difficult times will come. Men will cloak themselves with Christ and hide their sins. They will have an outward form of godliness, but will deny the power thereof. These people will fall into a worse condition. Hence, we have to turn away from them. Now the leaven of sin has fermented the whole lump. God's saints have not been charged to change the whole lump but to "turn away" (2 Tim. 3:5; Rom. 16:17), to be "separated" (2 Cor. 6:17), to "cleanse [oneself] from these" (2 Tim. 2:21), and to "come out from their midst" (2 Cor. 6:17; Rev. 18:4).</P><P>If we read the Epistles of Peter, John, and Jude, what we find are but more degrading tragedies of the church. We see that the nominal church had become desolate. Its judgment had become inevitable. All those who truly served the Lord, who would not be defiled by uncleanness, and who did not agree with the worldly organization, had become the remnant of the Lord. The books before Revelation tell us that even the churches at the time of the apostles had become defeated. What the epistles in Revelation tell us now are nothing new. But whatever revelation was added merely tells us how judgment was executed on the failures. They lost their position and were disqualified to be the church of the Lord's testimony anymore. By the time we come to the end of these epistles, we will realize that there is no such thing as the whole church repenting. Hence, the words "remove your lampstand out of its place" still hold true! If it was already the last hour (1 John 2:18) at the time of the apostles, what about now? This is but an extension of the last hour!</P><P>Although this is the condition of the church, the Lord could not hold back His love. That is why after His sober warning, He came back to praising them. Our Lord always lingers on the merits of His people and is reluctant to gloss over them. Therefore He said:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Six</H2><P>Verse 6: "But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate." </P><P>We will not cover the teaching of the Nicolaitans until we come to the section on Pergamos. Now, we will only mention their work in brief. No one knows who this party of people was in history. Previous writers have only hypothesized freely about this party; their theories are rather unacceptable. Whatever kind of people they were in Ephesus, they surely represented a group of strong ones in the whole church of God. Hence, the Lord purposely mentioned them twice. It is meaningless to merely say that they are an unknown sect. According to the interpretation of the prophecies in the seven epistles, the Nicolaitans, like Jezebel, typify a heresy. This word in the original language was composed of two words. The first means to subdue, and the second means the people. Hence, as far as the meaning of the word goes, the Nicolaitans means "those who subdue the people." After we have seen the works of these people, we realize that the way the apostles formed the church was gradually overturned. Some no longer consider all Christians as brothers. Some have established a group of "clergymen" who are higher than the ordinary believers. We do not see God instituting this in the New Testament. Everyone who is led of the Holy Spirit and the Word should see the danger in this work. If these "clergymen" are to have some ground and are to become successful, they have to divert the attention of the church and bring the church to follow a human leader while neglecting the heavenly Christ. In this way, the church will be divided and that which is completely spiritual will become worldly. The boundary between the church and the world will be erased, and the church will follow after the wiles and schemes of the world.</P><P>The apostles had spoken of the rise of this group of people before. When Paul told the Ephesians of "fierce wolves" (Acts 20:29-30), he was referring to this group of people. Peter also saw that this group of people were gaining ground in the churches. As a result, he told the elders who were receiving his Epistle to "shepherd the flock of God among you..nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock" (1 Pet. 5:2-3). John mentioned similar cases, particularly, "Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them" and how he cast out of the church those who would not submit to him (3 John 9-10). If we read the word of the Lord Jesus, we will realize His view towards this matter: "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave" (Matt. 20:25-27). "But you, do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers" (23:8). Although God establishes His servants to take care of the flock, they are all brothers in position (23:8). Although the Lord has charged men to administrate the church, this administration is in the nature of service. These men are the servants of all and do not hold authority in the way that the Gentile rulers do (20:25-27). Christ does not recognize any group of people as having a special position in the church which others do not have, or as having a special authority to do certain things which others cannot do. We cannot say too much concerning this now. We will speak of this when we come to the third church.</P><P>The church in Ephesus hated "the works of the Nicolaitans." This was pleasing to the Lord, because He said, "which [the Nicolaitans] I also hate." They sympathized with the Lord. However, the Lord reserved the mentioning of this point until He had issued the warning. He intended to show them that they had to be careful. They had left the first love, and although they were still barely able to maintain it, their position was already quite shaky. They should be careful; otherwise, they would fall. If a church has lost its love to the Lord, it is rare to find it leaving human organization. Although it can perform for a while, its position is already unsettled!</P><P>Here we can see how attentive our Master is in expecting His church to arrive at perfection. Although there are but small blemishes, He rebukes and hates them. However, have we not frequently heard others say, "There is no perfect church on earth?" We can answer calmly, "What is meant by a perfect church?" Should not a Christian seek to be perfect in everything and to match God's holiness? If perfection is our personal goal, it should be the goal of the church also. We have to admit humbly that individually we make many mistakes. We also admit that the history of the church is the same as ours. Nevertheless, we should not avoid the responsibility for the pursuit of holiness. Self excuse is the prison of all fallen ones. It imprisons us and keeps us from repentance. We must not think that one failure will necessitate continual degradation. Only by being dissatisfied with our present experience will we be pressed to pursue the higher things. We should not say that becuase no one is without sin, we can therefore bear defilements in our spirits. When the Lord comes, the responsibility of every believer will be to be fully and clearly prepared. All those who wait until the Lord comes before they tie their shoes and gird their loins are liable to be left behind. The Lord's expectation for the church is the same as His expectation for the individuals, for as His Holy Spirit abides in the individuals, He also abides in the church. As the saints have received the power of the cross within them to counteract sin, the church has received the same. Hence, the whole should be the same as the individuals. Unfortunately, the church has failed. As for individuals, there are not many who have overcome either.</P><P>Here we see a most important principle: if a church has become unfaithful, and if the whole body has become disqualified to be the Lord's testimony on earth, God will give up the whole and will call the individuals to submit to God's word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Seven</H2><P>Verse 7a:"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." </P><P>The church has been judged. Now the individuals have to hear what the Spirit is saying. The Lord knows that the whole church can no longer be used by God. Hence, He is calling the individuals. The whole has become fallen, but there may still be some individuals who are willing to submit to God. This is the reason that the Lord is calling the individuals. We have to realize that the organized church has already been judged in this age. God has abandoned it already. However, the work of the individuals will be judged in the future. In that day, at the judgment seat, the Lord will no longer judge the church as a whole for that has been condemned already. The individual's work, however, will be searched by the Lord's burning eyes for a reward or a punishment. The Lord says clearly here that unless the church repents, He will remove its lampstand in this age. This is a judgment on the whole and has been executed already because we know that in fact the church did not repent. As to the Lord's promises after this, they are for the individuals at the time of reward and punishment at the resurrection. As such, they are for the future.</P><P>As a whole, if a church has the presence of Christ within, we should follow the teaching of the church (Matt. 18:17). But what should we do if the church has left its first love, intentionally or unintentionally, and has usurped the place of Christ and the Holy Spirit, acting contrary to the teaching of the Bible, adding to it what the Bible never teaches, and shouting loudly for others to follow it? "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." The assertion of the authority of the church is a proposition of Roman Catholicism. In the present age of apostasy, what the saints should hear is not the church but the words of the Holy Spirit, that is, the Bible. The Lord's explicit teaching here is that the system of Romanism, its papal assertion, whether within the Roman Catholic Church, within the Protestant church, or in any other place that has their poisons, should be totally rejected. We should only hear God's word. The Lord is calling individual saints to hear what the Spirit is speaking to the churches so that through their understanding of Christ's mind they may be able to measure the condition of the church by His word. In other words, every believer should know the condition of the so-called church around him. But unfortunately, there are few who have an ear, and there are fewer who are willing to hear!</P><P>What the saints should hear is "what the Spirit says to the churches." It is not to the church but to the churches. Therefore, he who has an ear must not only hear what the Lord says to his own church but what He says to all the other churches. This command should not only be heeded by the saints of that day; it should not be neglected by the faithful lovers of the Lord in all ages.</P><P>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." The words are for the churches, but not all the churches will hear because there are many in them who do not have an ear. Hence, although the words are for the churches, only a few who have an ear can hear and keep them. This is why today's principle for a Christian is personal responsibility. In the ancient time, after the Lord had rejected the Israelites in Matthew 12, He spoke in chapter thirteen words that the ones being judged were not able to hear (vv. 13-15), so that the disciples who had ears could hear (v. 9). In the same way, the Lord has now judged the church and is speaking words that they "hear and by no means understand" (v. 14) so that those who have ears can follow Him individually. How solemn this is! The Lord's words are to the spiritual saints; they are not for the fleshly Christians. This is why they are not able to hear (1 Cor. 2:10-11). For this reason those who are able to hear should hear.</P><P>"To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God" (Rev. 2:7b). This word of promise to the overcomers is a sound of music. No matter how difficult is the pathway of the cross, we should not draw back. Though suffering is increasing, it should not make us surrender but should urge us on to victory. God's stars shine equally by day and by night, but darkness makes them shine brighter. Trials and tribulations are not present woes. These darknesses have been with us since the beginning of time. The way of faith has been this way since the beginning. How the coming reward attracts us! It turns our frustration on the homeward journey into a pursuit of the race ahead and intensifies our homesick sentiments! What will supersede the joy of Paradise except the blessed hope?</P><P>He "who overcomes." In the original language the word is in the singular. It refers to individual saints. The faithful individuals who have an ear can overcome. As a sinner need not wait for the whole world to believe in the Lord before he can be saved, a saint does not have to wait for the whole church to repent before he can overcome. An overcomer does not have to wait for a companion; everyone can overcome. In reality, most overcomers are alone. The Lord willing, He may give us some companions, but we must not wait until we have companions before we overcome. Abram did not want to go to Canaan alone. As a result, he was kept in Haran by his father. To wait for a companion is a waste of time. At any rate, the way we take is not void of forerunners' footsteps. At least a pair of feet with nail marks has trodden it before and has left us with clear footprints. Although the general situation of the church is enough to disappoint men, the Lord's calling is still going out to individuals. In spiritual matters there is no such thing as victory through numeric superiority. Although an overcomer has his crisis, he also has his reward. We all would like to have Paul's crown, but we do not want to have Steven's stones. May the Holy Spirit move the readers of these pages to become willing to take this way so that they may obtain their reward. May we know that God has not given the promise to the church that has left the first love. The rebuked and judged church will not be moved by the promises anymore; these are past events already. What she fears and waits for is judgment. It is a blessing that we can still have God's promises.</P><P>God's promises are for individuals. In these few epistles God did not give one promise to the whole church. In Revelation, God never takes the whole church as a unit and promises the same reward to the whole church. Even the conditions for the reward among the seven churches are different. For example, in Sardis only a few could receive the reward from the Lord. The rest were not qualified. The seven churches did not bear the same responsibilities. Under different circumstances they bear different responsibilities. The Lord's reward is not granted to all the believers of a church but to the overcomers. Among the believers, there should be the distinction between the overcomers and the saved ones! We should differentiate clearly between salvation and reward. All those who believe in the Lord Jesus will be saved, and all those who overcome will be rewarded. Not every one in the world is saved. In the same way, not every believer overcomes and receives the reward. The worldly Christian is satisfied with "standing at the gate of heaven." But those who know God's heart and who love the Lord will please Him in life and work. They will receive the Lord's smile in this age and His commendation in the next age. Although the whole church has failed, if there is one overcomer, the Lord's promise will be upon him and will cause him to rejoice and be comforted. Although this is a promise, it is not given to the fearful, the worldly, or the sinful ones, but to the overcoming ones. They sympathize with the Lord's heart. Hence, the Lord comforts them.</P><P>The reward that the overcomers receive is the prize they obtain apart from their salvation. The special work we perform during special trials will win us the Lord's special reward. After reading the Bible carefully, we can conclude that the distinction between the saved ones and the overcomers is merely in the coming age, that is, in the millennium. In eternity, there will not be a distinction anymore. However, is not one thousand years very long? Our evil heart often despises the Lord's reward, but if the Lord considers it worthwhile to reward us, should we not consider it worthwhile to win it? There are many opportunities for us to overcome and to get the reward. Those believers who love the world and who wallow in their lusts may be saved, but they cannot avoid being put to shame and suffering rebuke. This fact should awaken us.</P><P>Our life is a life that wars with Satan, the world, and the flesh. Those who overcome the sin in the flesh and the enticement of the world are few, but those who know how to attack Satan's work by prayer are fewer. Not every warrior will win. Hence, not every warrior will receive the reward. However, for everyone that goes to war, there is the possibility of winning. Out of warfare comes the victory. Unless one is determined to follow God's will intently and to counter all the attacks of Satan, there is no possibility of victory. We have to pay special attention to one thing here: the victory here is not just over Satan, the world, and the flesh. These are, of course, items to overcome. The overcoming here refers especially to the things in the church. All those who have overcome the former things must also overcome in the church! The church has left her first love. Hence, the overcomers have to keep their burning love for the Lord. These will be the overcomers in Ephesus and will receive what the Lord promises here. Furthermore, the obedience to the words of the Holy Spirit is linked to overcoming here. This is very meaningful. To hear the words of the Holy Spirit and to refuse the world and the church who has left its first love is to overcome.</P><P>"To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God." How this promise fits the condition of Ephesus! Man's ancestor was originally without sin. God charged him not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. He should have eaten of the tree of life. However, Satan came and deceived him to disobey God and to eat of the forbidden fruit. As a result, he was driven out of Eden and was forever separated from the tree of life that gives eternal life. He lost his first position. In the same way, the church was indeed holy at the beginning. Yet through the deception of the devil, it left its first love. The church became an organized community. It has lost its qualification as a testimony. But the present promise is no longer like that in the ancient time. The paradise of man can no longer be found. Instead, we have the Paradise of God. Furthermore, according to the original language, it is "the Paradise of My God," that is, the Paradise of the God of the Lord Jesus, the God whom the Lord Jesus knows. In this Paradise there is no longer the tree of knowledge of good and evil as a test to the saints for which they are responsible. There is only one tree, the tree of life, which affords the overcomers eternal enjoyment. What the overcomers will receive will be far more and far better than what Adam had lost. However, the condition for the possession of this tree of life is also harder. Adam was only required to maintain his first position. The saints today, however, must overcome. Only by overcoming can they return to their first love. When they return to the work of the first love, they will overcome.</P><P>Furthermore, the world has lost its paradise. Those in the world have been exiled from the tree of life for fear that they would live forever through eating it (Gen. 3:22). But what a pity it is that man has forgotten that the world has been condemned by God! They have attempted instead to set up another paradise here for their eternal abode! It is the love of the world that has turned the church in Ephesus cold towards the love of Christ. How would the Lord heal them? He wants them to remember their position in heaven. The world is not their settled abode. They should not lose their pilgrim nature. Paradise is their heavenly home. Our life is hidden with Christ there. For this reason, we should consider that as the place where our mind should be set.</P><P>Although we know that there will be a physical Paradise, and although we know that the conditions in it as described by the Bible are all physical conditions, there are spiritual significances in addition to the physical description (Rev. 22:1-2). How beautiful is this picture of the holy city in eternity! The very reading of this should stir up one's homeward desire! These descriptions are all physical in significance, but for now, we will consider their spiritual meaning. The street signifies move and work. The river signifies the Holy Spirit as the flow that gives life. The tree of life in the midst of the street and the river signifies that Christ is the focus of everything in the holy city. All moves center around Him. He is the life-pulse of everything. He is also in the midst of the river. The Holy Spirit has the Lord Jesus as His subject on earth. The same is true in heaven. Not only is He in the center, but He is on this side and that side as well. Whichever way you turn, you will see the tree of life and its fruits. The passing of every month does not see the wasting away of empty and uneventful days, but the renewed tasting of the goodness and satisfaction of Christ. Throughout our spiritual days, we will taste the manifold fruits of Christ. The reward of the overcomers is the right to eat of the tree of life. Among the Ephesians who had forsaken Christ as the center, those who had separated themselves from the others will receive this reward. Not only can the overcomers experience and enjoy this in the future, but they can do so even today. Is there not even one ear to hear this word? May those who have an ear hear this and overcome.</P><P>Furthermore, the tree of life in the garden has another significance, that of a dependent life. Adam should have received this. Although he was sinless, without receiving the nourishment of the tree of life he could not have lived long. God would have His creatures remember that their life is one that is dependent on God and cannot be independent. Even the life of those who have been redeemed by the blood and who have received eternal life is dependent on God. It lasts because it is dependent. Our life is one that is in Christ, that is, one that is in life, because the Son of God is life. We will forever enjoy His fruits. The most important thing for the Ephesians to do is to receive this message. Are not the hearts of all those under the same circumstance burning because of this promise? If man's mind, emotions, and will are independent, they are destined to fail. Those who do not rely on God are not able to be intimately joined to Him. They will not be able to receive His riches as their power for their living. Will not all those who have realized the blessing of dependence look to the future for greater fruits in a better environment? In that day in eternity we will realize the bliss of dependence. Through dependence we will taste of His eternal love. May the Lord gain our heart and our praises and blessing. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>APPENDIX-<br>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</H2><P>This church had committed three mistakes: (1) forgetting the Lord's power and His presence; for this reason, the Lord reminded them that He had the seven stars in His right hand and was walking in the midst of the seven lampstands; (2) forsaking the first love; and (3) looking to a human leader. Although they were saved temporarily from the Nicolaitans, they eventually failed.</P><P>This church represents the church after the age of the apostles. When we study history and consider the conditions then, we will realize that it was exactly as our Lord had described. A few decades ago some people found a book called The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles. It was written approximately ten or twenty years after the writing of Revelation. In it was a portion that quoted a prayer used at the Lord's supper then. It says, "May grace descend! May the world go by! Hosanna to the God of David! All those who are holy, come. All those who are not holy, repent. The Lord comes quickly. Amen."</P><P>We see that the church at that time had not forsaken the two ceremonies that the Lord had established. The two groups of workers, the elders and the deacons, still continued to hold their offices. They had orthodox faith concerning the hope of the Lord's coming, concerning the great tribulation, and concerning Antichrist, etc. However, there was no mention of the blood. In particular, there was a passage that said, "If you have wealth, give with your own hands, that your soul may have its ransom." This is a heresy. How deeply they had fallen! This is a complete departure from the first love.</P><P>Twelve years after John wrote Revelation, one "father" of that time, Ignatius, also wrote to the church in Ephesus. From that letter we can see that by then the church had left the system established by Christ and the apostles. Originally, overseers and elders were the same group of people. There was no such thing as one man ruling one church or many churches. We have mentioned this point before. However, the Nicolaitans were raised up. They changed the Lord's system, gave special authority to the workers, and established a sect. Ignatius did not stop this. On the contrary, he encouraged this from the side. In chapter six of his book, it was mentioned, "Hence, it is very obvious that as we honor the Lord Himself, we should also honor the bishop." Notice the word bishop here is singular. This shows us the beginning of the one-man-rule. This is not only true with Ephesus; all the churches of that day were under this snare. Hence, when Ignatius wrote to the Manicheans, he said, "As the Lord would not do anything apart from the Father, in the same way, you [the elders, deacons, or the members] should not do anything apart from the bishop."</P><P>By this we can see how the church then had left the first love. They had followed the example of the Israelites and had set up a king to rule over them. They looked more to a human leader than to Christ the Head. Because there were differences in opinion among the human leaders, many denominations were produced. They had forgotten that the mutual bond between the churches lies in the Lord who was among them. This lack of a unity in form and of a human leader was unbearable to their flesh. For this reason they established councils and nominated bishops as a way to imitate the worldly organizations. This is why the Lord revealed Himself as the Lord with the seven stars in His right hand, who walked among the seven lampstands. It is a pity that the Lord's words had fallen on stony ears!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>SUB-SECTION TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SMYRNA-<br>THE SUFFERING CHURCH<br>(2:8-11)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Eight</H2><P>Verse 8: "And to the messenger of the church in Smyrna write: These things says the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again."</P><P>We have seen how the church had left her first love to the Lord Jesus during the age of Ephesus. Now, in the age of Smyrna, we see how God judged this degradation and how He severely rebuked her failure. There is no way for the fallen and unrepentant ones except chastening. It is much better to be chastised by the Lord than to be forsaken by Him. Moreover, God's chastisement is not for a few days as it seems good to Him. "The Father of spirits" disciplines us "for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness" (Heb. 12:9-10). God's rod is always with a purpose, which is to bring us to a desired position. The church had lost her first love; this is too great a loss. The purpose of His chastisement was to cause His people to turn back to Him and to recover the freshness that was lost. Many times, what the voice of love cannot do, the chastening whip will do. Many who have left the fountain of living waters will not turn back until they find out that their broken cisterns will no longer hold water (Jer. 2:13). Many prodigals will not remember the love of the father until they have met famine and have worked among the hogs. Those who are not the Lord's, will flee from His rod at first sight. Those who belong to Him will kiss the whip that chastises them after they have been disciplined by the Lord. When things are prosperous and smooth, there is always danger of losing the burning love for the Lord. Many saints have their love for the Lord stirred up at the time of trials. Unless a church that has fallen from her first love first passes through deep water and severe fire, it is difficult to preserve the freshness of her truth.</P><P>We know that these seven churches are consecutive, that they were raised up one after another. When God saw that His church had lost her first position, He allowed Satan, who was always seeking for the opportunity, to persecute her so that through suffering she may learn to realize that God is her hiding place.</P><P>We have seen how Ephesus had left the first love and had turned to the world. Oh, how often has the world become a snare to the saints! Many have buried their love, testimony, zeal, and spirituality in this tomb of the world! But God knows how to heal. The fallen saint takes pleasure in the world. He follows after the world and draws his satisfaction from the people, events, and things of the world. For this reason, God changes the world so that the Christians would realize that the world is not their settled abode. Because the saints are not willing to forsake the world, God is forced to make the world bitter so that they would realize that the world is not their paradise. The world is now persecuting them. Will they still follow after it? The world that they love has now turned around to oppose them. How can they love the people, events, and things in it any longer? It is right for a fallen church to live in a persecuting world. It is also right for a worldly believer to live in an environment of suffering.</P><P>This is the meaning of the great tribulation. How many believers are there now who still love the world? Although they are manifested in different ways, their number is very great. Because of this, God has no choice but to hand them over to the great tribulation. God's original intention is that, through the cross of His Son, the saints would crucify the world on the cross, and they would pursue the things that are above and would leave behind the things of the earth. But, as a result of the enticement of the beauty and glory of the world, the saints ignore the legitimate demand of the cross, and they join themselves with the world. For this reason, in the end God has to bring them through the great tribulation and has to persecute them through the hand that they love, so that they will realize the hypocrisy in man's face and in his heart, and will find out that the Savior is their only true friend and their rock. This tribulation will be "such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur" (Matt. 24:21). Hence, this tribulation is very great. Formerly, the Lord's love was not able to draw them away from the world. Now, the world has become bitter. They find themselves stuck to it. They will want to leave the world behind as quickly as possible. They will begin to hate what they have formerly loved. They will come to realize that "the whole world lies in the evil one" (1 John 5:19). Hence, the world is not their place of rest. They will realize that "the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever" (2:17). Dear ones, do not love any person, event, or thing in the world. Otherwise, you will find yourselves entangled by what you desire.</P><P>The failure of the church is the motive behind the enemy's work. The fall of the church is the handle by which the church opens the door to the attack of Satan. Once a church leaves its first love, God's safe-guarding hand that preserves it from Satan is relaxed, and the church will suffer Satan's persecution. The enemy's attack is often two-sided, from within and from without. The results of the two are different. His outward attack often fail for God has no reason to allow the power of Satan to overrun His people. However, his inward deceptions are often beyond the discernment and defense of the saints. Only by putting on the whole armor of God can they stand firm in the evil days. The roar of the lion surely causes the saints to fear and to fall into his carefully designed trap. Though the enemy uses many tactics for attack, his goal is but one. However, God uses these threats of the enemy to drive His people to the proper hiding place. This is often the result seen in the genuine and regenerated believers.</P><P>Smyrna is a suffering church. While they were suffering, they may have considered the fiery trials a matter of surprise. But trials are not ominous. What saddens the Lord the most is that believers would depart from these trials and would no longer suffer for the Lord or for righteousness. The Lord desires that we be tried, but not because of sin. Every time the Lord chastises His people, it is for one of the following two reasons: He chastises us either because of our mistakes, or because we are about to commit a mistake and are not aware of it. In his trials, David composed many sweet psalms, which, of course, were inspired by the Holy Spirit. These psalms are still in men's hearts and on their lips today. But as soon as David became prosperous, he fell into sin. The fear of trials and the craving for ease and comfort are signs of spiritual danger. Those who may fail in trials may not yet have failed in ease, but this does not mean that they will not fail. We think that it is easier to live in ease, but without the difficult trials of fire, there are no difficult battles, and victory is relatively easy. However, trials expose a man's true condition! Actually, trials cause us to realize how God deals with us and how He works for us. Sometimes, the trials are there to keep us from sinning. God sees many dangers that we do not see. He uses many seemingly difficult things, which are actually not difficult at all, to avert the coming failures we face. God's way of dealing with man has always been the granting of trials upon man. But it is a pity that failure seems to be man's allotted portion. However, God cannot sacrifice His glory.</P><P>Although we may think that the suffering of Smyrna was in the nature of a chastening rod, we cannot consider her suffering to be purely of this nature. Those who suffer with Christ may not be the ones who suffer for Christ. However, sometimes God would have us suffer for Christ while we are suffering with Him. The saints in Smyrna suffered because of their submission to Christ. They were faithful in serving Christ, and as a result, they were put into death. Their suffering was for Christ as well as with Christ. This suffering then is not a vain suffering. When the time comes, they will receive their reward.</P><P>The root of the word "Smyrna" in Hebrew means "bitterness." This word was used in conjunction with myrrh, the spice for embalming the dead (John 19:39). It is connected to death. The characteristic of this church is linked to its name and has to do with suffering. This is a church suffering for Christ. The Lord had lovingly restrained the roaring of the enemy so that His people would recover the freshness they had for the Lord, which otherwise would have been lost in their comfort. Although the Lord allowed His children to suffer, He stayed His harsh wind in the day of the east wind (Isa. 27:8), promising them, encouraging them, praising and cherishing them, so that they would move forward. He had no word of rebuke for their suffering. Instead, He kindly revealed His own power and experience as their comfort in distress.</P><P>The Lord revealed Himself as "the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again" (Rev. 2:8). The first expression reveals His divinity. He is God, and He has power in Himself. He is the God that opposes Satan. Here the Holy Spirit calls the Lord Jesus by the name used by Isaiah in the ancient time when He fought for Jehovah (Isa. 41:4). Is there a name so great that our Lord is not worthy to bear it? What a comfort this name is to those who are suffering and are oppressed! Many times, when hope is lost, the shaking faith would wonder where God is, thinking that it is in the world alone, fighting the cruel force of the enemy by itself. However, this is not the fact. Whatever might have happened, our Lord is always "the First," promising us with the precious promises. At the same time, He is also "the Last," being full of authority and power to execute what He has promised and will not fail even one iota or tittle. He is the First and the Last. Hence, He can lead His people on from the beginning to the end. Since He is the First as well as the Last, all the causes of His people are taken up by Him. What more then is there to fear? Hence, wavering believers, what more is there to cause us to worry?</P><P>He is also the One "who became dead and lived again." He was God. Yet He descended to the death-place and came out of it. He has trodden the path that His people are now treading. Hence, He has sympathy. Who is the One that was speaking to them? He is the God-man who had experienced the greatest suffering on the whole earth and had Himself passed through death. "When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them" (John 10:4). He asks of His people only to drink the cup that He has drunk and to be baptized in the baptism that He Himself has been baptized into. He has gone through all their sufferings already. Hence, He knows how to comfort them. "For being tempted in that which He Himself has suffered, He is able to help those who are being tempted" (Heb. 2:18). The end of His death-road is eternal life. For His faithful disciples, the same must be true. The Lord Jesus is God, but He also is a man. He was a suffering man, and a victorious man. For this reason, He is able to comfort those in suffering. Is there anything that He has not tasted? When we are tried, we are being brought before such a Lord. What a gospel there is for those in suffering and trials! How fitting it is for the church in Smyrna and the saints in Smyrna to see the Lord's nature as such here.</P><P>Although He was the judging One, He was still mindful of His people's needs. In the difficult and perilous days, He was still with them. He is no longer rescuing His people as He did in the Old Testament, because at that time, men did not yet know that He is the victor over death. His deliverance then was to deliver them out of the furnace and the lions' den, and to save them from death. Although Satan could try Job with sufferings, he could not kill him. "And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life" (Job 2:6). Here there was not such a restraint. Instead, they should be faithful unto death. The Lord did not promise to save them from the grave. They should instead die to glorify God. Christ is able not only to deliver us from death, but to overcome death. He wants us to realize the power of the latter. The death of the body does nothing but lead us to the presence of Christ.</P><P>"Who became dead and lived again." This underlines the Lord's resurrection. The Lord's death is not a death forever. Rather, it leads to resurrection. Many times it is the hope of resurrection that is the strength of the martyrs. Second Corinthians 1 to 5 links the resurrection of the dead to the comforting of the suffering ones. The greatest power of the enemy is death. However, the Lord transcended death and passed through death. After the body is dead, the authority of the enemy will be over. Death is not for death alone, but for the initiation into a life more abundant, which is resurrection. Hence, why should one be concerned about death? Christ is the First and the Last. He is the One before death and the One after death. Moreover, He has experienced the power of death. Therefore, the saints need not be afraid. The Savior has passed through its stronghold. He is almighty, and He will open up the way to save His people. After they die, they will receive their reward.</P><P>Here the Lord Jesus is declaring His death and resurrection. These are the foundations of victory for the believers. The Lord's death and His resurrection are the only way for the Lord to overcome sin, death, and the Devil. Likewise, His saints cannot find victory in any other way. The victory of the church lies in her union with the Lord in His death and resurrection. The unique ground of defeat for sin is Golgotha, the place of the Lord's death. The Devil and all his powers meet their deathblow at the cross. In particular, this is true with the matter of death. When the Lord's death operates in us, we will bear in our body the Lord's death (2 Cor. 4). The spirit of martyrdom is derived from the death of the Lord. Although the Lord has no intention that every believer be martyred, He does have the intention that we live as martyrs and that we maintain a spirit of martyrdom in everything. It is not easy to be courageous all the way and to be unchanging in the face of death. Only by setting our mind on the Lord on the cross, on His suffering, and on His final victory in life will we be filled with the Lord's boldness and not be afraid of the death of our body, but will be a martyr in all things. Not only has the Lord's resurrection given us a hope and a boldness to be a martyr, but through a union with His resurrection, He has given us a life to live out the spirit of martyrdom. The Lord's death and resurrection are not two historical events only. These are spiritual facts. If we are joined to them, we will see the Lord's life prevail in our life. The Lord is calling the church to tread the path that He has taken, because it is only proper for the Body to go through what the Head has experienced. Mere knowledge of the Lord's death and resurrection will not produce much effect on us. Only those who are joined to the Lord in His death and resurrection will experience a walk that the Lord has walked.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Nine</H2><P>Verse 9: "I know your tribulation and poverty (but you are rich) and the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."</P><P>"I know." The condition of the church and her trials are under the Lord's discernment. He knows how the church has suffered for Him. He knows how the church has become poor for His sake, and He knows what the suffering and poverty of the church mean. He is well-acquainted with these things. His past experience enables Him to comfort them in an understanding way: "I know your tribulation." Moreover, He can praise them in the sweetest manner: "I know your poverty." "Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult" (Matt. 5:11-12). The Lord took note of how they had suffered for Him and had persevered in silence. To us, the day of rejoicing comes only when suffering has ceased. But the Lord charged us to rejoice in sufferings. This is the overflow of salvation. He remembers with what spirit we bear persecution and does not forget our faithfulness. If we would trust Him as we would trust our Maker, we will see His comforting hands.</P><P>To almost all the other churches, the Lord said: "I know your works." But the Lord did not say the same thing to the church in Smyrna. The Lord considers it more important to suffer for Him than to work for Him. Suffering is the best work. The believers may have many accomplishments in working for the Lord. However, if there is no suffering for the Lord, these accomplishments are of little worth before Him. During the time of persecution, it is true that the church cannot have much outward endeavor. However, faithfulness in loving the Lord is what pleases Him. A testimony of a suffering life is the best testimony; here the wordless prevails over the wordy.</P><P>"Tribulation and poverty" are two characteristics of a faithful lover of the Lord. Those who truly live up to the standard of the Lord's holiness in this evil world have no choice other than to forsake the world, for the world has forsaken them. Tribulations, sufferings, and persecutions are the unavoidable portion of the saints in the world (1 Thes. 3:3). In order to be for the Lord, to obey His word, and to carry out His will, surely there will be much misunderstanding from the world, and there will even be persecutions. However, though the suffering is deep, is not the love of the Lord manifested in these sufferings deeper than the sufferings themselves? Often the love of the Lord is poured out from the Holy Spirit upon our hearts at the time of suffering. Other than suffering, there is no way for us to have such a sweet taste of the Lord's love. Every suffering that we encounter in our heart and soul and every wound in our body that we suffer for the Lord draw us closer to the Lord. Do not our outpoured tears and crying before the Lord set our heart on fire to yearn for Him?</P><P>Tribulations are often the forerunners of poverty. Sufferings usually lead to poverty, that is, to the loss of our legitimate blessings in this age. It is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. The reason for this is that in the kingdom of heaven, though one will be rich, he will at the same time be poor; one becomes poor for the Lord's sake. Although the so-called "standard of living" can become an excuse for comfortable living, what "standard of living" can be a justifiable reason when it is compared with the way the Son of God lived when He descended from heaven? The Lord may not have called us to give up everything and to live a life of utter poverty for His sake. But then, how much have we been stripped in our eating and clothing for His sake? The word poverty should at least be a practice in our daily life. Those who become poor and who suffer for the Lord will surely be rewarded in the future. As for those who have already satisfied their heart's desire today, how can they hope to receive special praise at the judgment seat of the Lord?</P><P>"But you are rich." The believers at Smyrna were greatly pressed and had become poor. Yet they gladly bore everything. The Lord told them that while their treasure is accumulating in heaven, their portion now is rich. It is indeed true that "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth" (Prov. 11:24). Their poverty is the result of their tribulation. Hence, poverty is mentioned after tribulation and before slander. The goal of such a great persecution is but the ushering in of spiritual riches. The tribulation of the church halts her degradation and turns her to a greater trust in God.</P><P>"Poverty (but you are rich)." How contrary is this to the condition of Laodicea! The latter boasted: "I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing." Actually, they were ignorant that they were "wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked" (3:17). "Poverty...rich"! "Poverty...rich"! The Lord considers Smyrna who is poor in the world to be rich, and Laodicea who is rich in the world to be poor. Blessed are those who are aware of this. "And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted" (Matt. 23:12). This is an unchanging law. To boast about success and prosperity in the present condition of degradation and desolation is to be ignorant of oneself and to be beguiled by worldly foolishness. Only a spiritual discernment can search all things and can see riches in poverty, and poverty in riches. One may be prosperous in his enterprise, successful in his work, and may see growth and profit all around. Yet the Lord may not have the same valuation as he does. On the other hand, those who are faithful for the Lord, who love the Lord zealously, and who are willing to suffer opposition and persecution from the world and from the church for the Lord's sake and for His truth's sake, though void of great endeavors in the world, are precious in the Lord's eyes. Only those who are truly spiritual can be free from the desire for worldly prosperity, and only those who have truly died to self can humble themselves to seek after the Father's will with a single heart. The cross is in fact the greatest and the first victory. But to the world, the cross was a complete defeat! If the Lord Himself had to go through this "defeat" to gain victory, what else can we expect? Those who are poor for the Lord's sake should realize that they gain the Lord's heart more than those who are rich in the world.</P><P>"And the slander from those who call themselves Jews..." (Rev. 2:9). The Lord not only knows the tribulations of His people and puts their tears into His bottle (Psa. 56:8), He also knows the cruelty and slander of their persecutors. As a result of their tribulations, His people have not tolerated evil. They have rejected the doctrine of those who have called themselves Jews but are not.</P><P>It is true that there are many faithful ones. However, we should not think that because of this the church is at her golden age and that she is full of glory and void of failures. Although the Lord was fully sympathetic towards His suffering people, He pointed out the problem that everyone else did not see: "the slander from those who call themselves Jews."</P><P>"Who call themselves Jews and are not." This expression carries a few meanings:</P><P>(1)Those who are called Jews but are not are Jews according to the flesh. Although the Jews according to flesh call themselves Jews, they are actually not Jews. They are but Jews outwardly. Inwardly they are not Jews. This undoubtedly corresponds to the apostle's word in Romans 2: "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly...But he is a Jew who is one inwardly" (vv. 28-29). They are only Jews outwardly. If they were the real Jews, they would have believed in the Lord Jesus and would have become a part of the church.</P><P>The Jews were the enemy of the church in Smyrna. In the first few centuries, the Jews were always linked with the persecutors of the church. Such a condition as it was in those days, where the descendants of Abraham joined hands with the unbelieving Gentiles to persecute the believers, was especially unbearable for the believers. God's holy Word was originally entrusted to the Jews. It is easy for Satan to put a doubt in the believers' mind: "For hundreds of years they have been the chosen people for God's testimony, the kingdom from which the Messiah came. When they say that we are wrong, should we not doubt the position we are standing on?"</P><P>(2)But there is a more crucial meaning here. These people are not only Jews in the flesh. If so, since these people are Jews already, why do they have to call themselves Jews again? Why did the Lord have to prove with such emphasis that they were not Jews? If they were Jews, it was only right and proper for them to call themselves Jews. Why did the Lord have to rebuke them? It would be meaningless for God to judge the church simply because they were Jews in the flesh. Therefore, there must be some deeper meaning here.</P><P>These people were counterfeit Jews. They were actually Judaizers in the church. The Lord considered them people who called themselves Jews but were actually not. They were the ones in the church who wanted to mingle Christianity with Judaism. In other words, they wanted to combine the Old Testament with the New Testament and to mix grace with the law. Because this matter is crucially related to the whole church and to individual believers as well, we have to discuss its history in detail.</P><P>At the beginning, there were these Judaizers in the church. They thought that those Gentiles who had believed in Christ should also keep the Mosaic law, be circumcised, and do other things. Actually, these Judaizers had at the same time become the believers of Christ and the disciples of Moses.</P><P>This group of people can be traced from the history in the Bible. Before Peter went to the house of Cornelius, and before he saw the vision of the great sheet, the Christians at that time still considered it an unlawful thing to preach to the Gentiles. Although they were believers of Christ, they still kept the commandment in the law that forbids the eating of things common (Acts 10). While it is true that the Old Testament does teach this matter, they failed to realize that the age had changed. When we read this chapter, we realize that without putting aside the law, there is no possibility for the Gentiles to believe in the Lord and be saved. The fact that the Gentiles have believed in the Lord and are saved proves that the law has lost its binding power in this age. Further on, we see how the Holy Spirit and the church (15:28) saw it good not to have the Gentile believers keep the laws of Moses. That conference set the rule for the Gentile believers' walk throughout the ages. Within a short time, the decision was made; the Gentile Christians no longer needed to be circumcised or keep the laws of Moses, as some believing Pharisees had demanded (v. 5). However, the tide of the age then was still for the ordinances of the Old Testament. Its influence on man was surprisingly great. A person who understood God's way of grace as much as Peter did (vv. 7-11) would still falter in his walk on account of man and would be rebuked by Paul (Gal. 2:11-14). Even Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, was not entirely clear in many areas at the beginning concerning this matter. He may have done what he did for the sake of keeping peace, but he was not successful. He circumcised Timothy (Acts 16:3), he himself made a vow (18:18), and he performed the ceremony of purification (21:24). Paul did not need to do any of these things. Yet because of the strong opposition of the time, he compromised to avoid trouble. The greatest persecutions of Paul came, on the one hand, from his countrymen (the Jews according to flesh), and on the other hand, from the believing Jews. These were but the beginning of the work of the Judaizers in the church at that time. Their poison, however, remains until today and has become even more serious; there is no sign of their going away.</P><P>The Bible is not lacking in warnings concerning the danger of the Judaistic teaching. The books of Galatians and Hebrews are written specifically to counter this error. The Judaistic teaching causes man to fall from grace and to underestimate Christ's accomplished work. Hence, the apostle ranked the Judaizers who were of the concision with the dogs and the evil workers (Phil. 3:2). If this teaching were not so dangerous, the Holy Spirit would not have inspired Paul to deal with these people so severely.</P><P>The Judaistic teachings, that is, the teachings that turn believers back to the Old Testament to the keeping of the commandments of the law, cannot solve the problems of life, death, salvation, and perdition. In the age of the law, there was never the assurance of salvation, and there was never the justification of man. Although the law says that "if a man do he shall live by them" (Lev. 18:5), yet it also says "there is none that doeth good, no, not one" (Psa. 14:3). That is all that the law could do. Actually, it was predestinated to be so: "Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God" (Rom. 3:19). God desires to give grace to man. However, before grace can be preached, man must first be rounded up under sin and must have nothing to boast about or depend on, so that he has no other way except to receive God's grace. Hence, the function of the law is to test man, to expose man's sin, and to put man under sin (Gal. 3:19; Rom. 3:19; Gal. 3:23). It paves the way for grace to come in (Gal. 3:24-25). The law itself cannot save man. It only paves the way for grace to come in. This proves the uselessness of the law. The establishment of the New Testament is a proof of the inability of the Old Testament.</P><P>The law lords it over a man as long as he lives (Rom. 7:1). As long as man lives, he has the responsibility to fulfill the commandment in the law. As long as a man is not yet dead, once he transgresses the law, he will come under the judgment of the law. "For whoever...stumbles in one point has become guilty of all" (James 2:10). A little oversight amounts to the breaking of all the law and destines him to perdition. All those who are under the law live and walk in fear and suspense. They do not know when they will die. Hence, they do not know when they will sin. As long as they are alive, they can still fall under sin. Hence, to them, before they die, there is always the possibility of condemnation and hence perdition. The matter of eternal life and condemnation to them can only be finalized after one is dead. What a frustrating life this is! Every day one lives in fear and trembling, with eternal fire waiting by his side. Salvation is not a concrete fact, but a remote hope. These then are the "blessings" that the law at its best can give to man!</P><P>The law cannot draw man close to God. It makes man fearful of God. In the age of the law, the veil was not opened. In the age of grace, the veil is rent. The law says: "Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live" (Exo. 33:20). Grace on the other hand says: "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" (John 14:9). In the Old Testament age, no one could come directly to God. The priests were a special class of people between God and the Israelites. If the Israelites wanted to draw near to God, they had to do it through the priests. God was behind the veil, and there was a separation between God and man. Only the special class could draw near to God. All other common people who would come near would be killed. How different it is from the foundation laid in the New Testament! By the blood of the Lord Jesus, we have passed the veil to enter the Holy of Holies. The relationship between us, the saints, and God is direct. We are all priests (Rev. 1:6). The characteristic of the New Testament is that we "walk in the light as He is in the light," and that we "fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" (1 John 1:7).</P><P>The Israelites were God's earthly people. God dealt with the Israelites in the principle of the flesh. Such things as circumcision, the Sabbath, the sacrifices, and the feasts were all things according to the flesh. The Israelites became Israelites through their birth. They had many things of which they could boast in the flesh. The Gentiles were like dogs. This is absolutely contrary to the principle of the New Testament. Through the cross, God has condemned the flesh. To God, it is no longer a matter of birth, but of rebirth. The distinction of the flesh has ceased: "Both Jews and Greeks...are all under sin...for there is no distinction" (Rom. 3:9, 22). Those who were born as Israelites in the Old Testament cannot be compared to those who are regenerated today, who receive eternal life and justification. The people of God could perish eternally, while those who were not the people of God could have eternal salvation. That was the result of the way of the flesh.</P><P>Actually, grace and the law can never be mingled together. It is impossible for the Old Testament to be mixed with the New. The Judaistic Christians, through their worldly concepts and ideas, considered that the principles of the law and of grace should be mingled together. As a result, they led others into darkness.</P><P>The Judaistic teaching replaces the peace accomplished on the cross with a condition of the law that is past and a shaky uncertainty concerning the future. In this Judaistic gospel, the assurance of salvation is but a conjecture: "How can one know that he is saved before he dies? Even if a person has become one of the people of God, when he sins and fails, will he not be lost again? It is of course good to believe in the Lord Jesus. Yet one must have works also. Otherwise, he cannot be saved. It is true that works do not save a person, but faith must have works added to it before it will save a sinner. Whenever works are missing, a person will go back to perdition." Under such a Judaistic teaching, who can have peace? Everywhere is dreadful uncertainty: "I have indeed believed in the Lord Jesus, but I dare not say if I am saved." "I am only doing my best to do good, with the hope that God will be gracious to me." This kind of erroneous teaching leads man to doubt the promise of God. To these teachings, all the assured future and all the present joy of the gospel are uncertain and unstable.</P><P>Has not Christ Himself said: "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill" (Matt. 5:17)? Hence, to these ones, a Christian should trust in God's grace, but should also keep the law: "One should do his best to keep the law and should look to God's mercy for what he comes short of. It is true that one is saved through believing in the Lord Jesus. However, if one fails and breaks the law, he will be a man of perdition. The Sabbath and other similar things are what Christians ought to keep. It is right to keep them; but if one fails to keep them, he should ask for the Lord's grace." We cannot imagine what this kind of half-law-half-grace teaching will lead man to. Law and grace are two principles that can never be reconciled (Rom. 11:6). To put the new wine in the old wineskin will only damage both. But the greatest damage will be for those who want to have the new wine. We Gentiles were those without the law: The "Gentiles, who have no law...they have no law" (Rom. 2:14). After we have believed in the Lord, we have not been transferred into the rule of the law: "You are not under the law"; "whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law" (Rom. 6:14; 3:19). Hence, the law never has anything to do with us, the Gentile believers. For us to come under the subjection of the law is to fall from grace and to despise the redemptive work of the cross.</P><P>There are too many errors in the teachings of the Judaizers. They cause man to doubt the assurance of his salvation; they rob man of his freedom and put him under the heavy yoke of the law again (Gal. 5:1). In addition to these, there are many other effects.</P><P>God has come out of obscurity. Darkness has departed from God, and the true light has shone. Yet the Judaistic teaching put God back into obscurity: Baptism and the "Communion" have replaced the ordinances of Judaism. The clergy system has replaced the Levitical priesthood. When the church is joined with the Old Testament saints, its claim to orthodoxy becomes all the stronger! The church has inherited all the promises God gave to Abraham and has thus become richer in its inheritance! Man can no longer draw near to God. The common priesthood of all the believers has degenerated into the private possession of a group of clergymen. They become the go-between between God and man, the representative of Christ, and to come to them is considered as coming to Christ. What a pity it is that even in Protestantism such poison is still found! The "high church" is of course poisoned by it, but the "low church" is not free from its damage either. One cannot help but sigh at the present system of the church. Ninety percent of it is no longer according to the original pattern, but has become Judaistic. Although there are specially gifted ones in the Bible, there is not a special class of "clergymen" who stand between the laity and God, performing many things which the laity are not supposed to do. Baptism was originally committed to all the disciples, instead of to the apostles (Matt. 28:19). The Lord's supper was a time for the believers to break bread together (Acts 2:41-42; 20:7). But now, these matters have been monopolized by the clergymen. The system of pastors, of one man ruling over a church, and of the affiliation of churches, are all products of the Judaizers. They are not found in the New Testament and are in fact opposed by the New Testament. The effect of these things is to cut off the direct traffic between God and the believers in various things, so that there seems to arise between God and man an intermediary class. This is the result of the Judaistic teaching.</P><P>The Judaistic teaching is a religion that belongs to man's flesh. As such, it places man under the law and adds to him many ordinances and titles of the flesh. We worship God in spirit and in truth. However, the Judaistic teaching would take us away and rob us of our original position. Is it not true that many things in the church are only Christian in name but are actually works of the flesh? The cross has terminated the fleshly man in God's holy judgment. The Holy Spirit has been sent to continue the judgment of the flesh in the saints' hearts. It is an abominable thing to recover the things that God has already judged. All the things that are orderly and proper in the eyes of man are but of "the synagogue of Satan" in the eyes of God. These people are again mentioned in the letter to Philadelphia. There they are filled with the hypocrisy of the fleshly religion, and they oppose those who keep the Lord's word and confess the Lord's name at the end of the period of the church's testimony on earth. This is the Judaistic teaching; it robs the Christians of the enjoyment of the position they inherit from God. It is also this teaching that takes them away from any portion in the world, because grace has already called them out. It is this teaching that has established a class of priests as an intermediary group between the men full of mixture and the far-away God. Although God has the ultimate authority in everything, such teaching is a big victory for the enemy. Hence, there is no title more fitting than "the synagogue of Satan" to describe these Judaistic teachers. They have shamed the church of the Lord and have lowered it to become the synagogue of Satan. Hence, the Lord no longer considers them as His people, but as those of the synagogue of Satan. This is like what the Lord told these people before: "You are of your father the devil" (John 8:44).</P><P>This term shows the change in the church. Originally, the church of God is different in every way from the synagogue of Satan. If we translate the word "church" as "the called-out assembly" according to the original language, much misunderstanding and many mistakes will be avoided. For example, although the church is the spiritual temple of God, there are still those who consider a physical building as the church. In the Bible, the church of God is the Body of Christ. In the church of God, there is only the fellowship among the members of Christ; no one else can participate in this fellowship. Although outwardly the church has many errors which are not in keeping with God's ordained standard, God's intention will not change because of this. What we are demonstrating at the Lord's table is the one great truth: "Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread" (1 Cor. 10:17).</P><P>The word "church" in the original language is ekklesia, which means the called-out congregation. It is composed of the members of the Body of Christ called out by God's grace from the world. The word "synagogue" in the expression "the synagogue of Satan" is completely different from the word ekklesia. The former only carries the meaning of a gathering. "Synagogue" is a Jewish term, whereas "church" is a Christian term. These two terms identify the differences between these two groups. The Body of Christ is a union of all the members called out from the world. The synagogue of Satan is not called out from anywhere. Rather, it is merely a motley group gathered together. If the church of God is a church, that is, an ekklesia, it should not have any mixture of people among it other than the regenerated and called-out ones. If it does, it will be only a synagogue. This shows how the church has degraded from the position of an ekklesia into a synagogue.</P><P>The Lord is not speaking to these people here. These people do not seem to be the recipients of the epistle. Neither does the Lord consider it the responsibility of the messengers that these people exist. However, the Lord did not speak directly to the Nicolaitans or the disciples of Balaam in Pergamos nor to Jezebel in Thyatira either. Yet no one can deny that these people were part of those in the two churches. The Judaistic teachers here are also members of the church then. Alas, the church has become almost fully degraded and desolated from the beginning! What a solemn thing this is! This is true in all generations. How long did man's ancestor remain in Eden? What about mankind before the flood? What about the descendants of Noah? What about the Israelites in the wilderness, and what about them after they had entered Canaan? The day the priesthood was established, it was defiled. The first king died on the battlefield. The builder of the temple was also the builder of idol sanctuaries. Those who waited for the Messiah were the ones who crucified the Son of God on the cross. The special grace that God bestowed on the church only made her degradation all the more pitiful. Has God ever made up for the failure of the fallen ones? No, instead He turns and creates something new. Can the church be an exception to this rule? As far as the organization of the church is concerned, God has rejected the church already. Now His eyes are turned to the kingdom. This is fully shown in every epistle. When we realize this, we will know how we ought to be faithful.</P><P>We should be careful. "The synagogue of Satan" is a severe rebuke. We should not impose this title on all those who had fallen prey to the heresy of Judaism, nor should we apply the same principle to those of today. According to the Bible, this title is applied only to those who vehemently promote the heresy; it does not apply to those who are deceived to follow the heresy. The word of God points out to us the real condition of everything; it also shows us the reason behind every heresy. Yet to man, love is always the best hope. However, we should not become blind through love, taking evil as good, and bitter as sweet. Love in fact does not have any slight toleration for sinful teachings. Can one consider it love to tolerate poison in the food of others? But then, to men, we must have love and must hope that they would also receive the truth. Today, all around us, we see the effect of the Judaistic teachings: God has retreated behind the veil, man has departed from God, everywhere there is darkness and uncertain hopes, the church is mingled with the world, believers have lost their joy and blessing, and the church has degenerated. All these are the results of this teaching. As to its full development, that is recorded in the other epistles.</P><P>Hence, we see that the Judaistic teaching is the source of failure in the outward form of the church, in the same way that the departure from the first love was the cause for the degradation of the inward content of the church. The reason the Judaistic teaching is mentioned here is so that we would understand the severity of the condition of desolation of the day. First, God rebuked the departure from love. Next, He pointed out the error in doctrine. The former leads to the latter. When one departs from the first love and loses the intimate fellowship with God, spontaneously it will become difficult for him to be preserved in the pure doctrine. Once there is a barrier between God and man, spontaneously one will be drawn back into the teaching of the flesh. The failures of Ephesus and Smyrna are matters of cause and effect. To preserve the purity of doctrine, one must preserve the purity of love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Ten</H2><P>Verse 10: "Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."</P><P>"The things that you are about to suffer." The Lord Jesus is here forewarning His people of their coming sufferings. The Lord Jesus is the prophet to His church; He knows everything that is going to happen. There is not one thing that He does not know. He is our watchman. Before any calamity comes, He warns us ahead of time and causes us to realize our position. If we want to serve the Lord faithfully, we will surely encounter sufferings and persecutions. The result of taking the way of the cross is termination at the cross. The cross that we believe in will eventually crucify us. To be the Lord's disciples, we have to relinquish everything. He who does not love the Lord more than he loves his parents, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and his own life is not worthy to be the Lord's disciple. Those who want to follow the Lord and to live in godliness cannot avoid persecutions. The Lord has not deceived us. He has not kept back His words before we became His disciples, and then left us to undergo unexpected sufferings afterwards. He told us already that there are sufferings which we are "about to suffer." He does not intend that we face the persecutions from the world unprepared. Rather, He told us that "in the world you have affliction" (John 16:33). In this way, those who want to build towers and engage in wars will know how to "sit down and calculate the cost," and to "sit down and deliberate" (Luke 14:28, 31).</P><P>The Lord not only forewarns us of sufferings in the pathway ahead, He also encourages us ahead of time, saying: "Do not fear." Fear is the characteristic of all feeble creatures. It is unavoidable for the flesh to tremble before coming suffering. The Lord's word is not intended to inform us of the sufferings and then lead us to fear. His forewarning is to save us from fear. The Lord knows our weaknesses; He also knows the root of our weaknesses. To remove fear is to remove failure. Fear is the first step to failure. Those who are afraid of suffering are mostly subdued by the enemy and are bound; they turn to the easy way in everything. It is indeed true that man's desires often become his snares, and man's fears cause him to withdraw. Satan's way is to cause man to run away out of fear, or to drop his standard out of fear of running away. Many times, by opening up to private dealings with the enemy, we avoid what is threatening us. But will those who faithfully love the Lord and who willingly serve Him do such a thing? The Lord has no intention for us to be careless, loose, and unwatchful as a result of overcoming the fear of suffering and persecution. Before trials come, many are self-confident and would boast of their boldness. But when persecution comes, they would fail. However, those who are careful and sober, who are apprehensive of the possibility of failure, are often the ones who secure full victory and who glorify the Lord's name. It is wrong to be fearful, but it is also important to be careful. Only those who are not self-confident will not fear. Otherwise, failure is certain. There is a distinction between fearlessness and carelessness or self-confidence.</P><P>"Do not fear." What is the reason that they should not fear? It is not that the tribulations are small. Actually, the tribulation of that day was greater than what the flesh can bear. Neither is it the promise of protection from tribulations. On the contrary, they were to pass through the tribulations completely. It is not that they have the power to withstand or that they could be faithful in the tribulations. If those were the reasons, they would be very untrustworthy indeed. In other places the Lord has told us: "In the world you have affliction, but take courage [be not afraid]; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). His victory is the basis of our victory. It is not that He is victorious and that we can therefore be victorious by ourselves. Rather, it is that He is victorious, and we are victorious in Him. Although He is the best pattern in the world, apart from Him we are powerless. We will suffer tribulations. However, we do not need to fear because of these tribulations, for the power of Christ is greater than that of Satan. We should declare with the apostles: "But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us" (Rom. 8:37). Because we have Him, and for this reason only, we are not afraid. How precious is this "Him"!</P><P>"Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried" (Rev. 2:10). Not only do the Lord's flaming eyes see the future tribulations coming out of man's organizations, but they search into the activity of the demons in the air amidst these tribulations. The church in Smyrna would not only receive reviling and suffering from the hand of man, but would suffer greater persecutions. The devil would cast some of them into prison. Here we see the Lord revealing to us the true condition behind everything. He wants us to know that the one who persecutes, hurts, and kills us is not the Roman emperor, officers, or soldiers, but the devil. The Lord Jesus wants us to identify clearly who our enemy really is, who is the one that is really hurting us, and who is the real source of all sufferings. It is very easy for us to look at man and to hate man. But the Lord wants us to know the creator of all sufferings. Humanly speaking, it was Peter who tried to stop the Lord Jesus from going to the cross. But the Lord Jesus did not see Peter. Rather, He saw Satan. Humanly speaking, the woman who was bent double was sick of a physical illness. However, the Lord considered it as a bondage of Satan. Many things appear to be works of man and are natural in the human eyes. But the Lord Jesus discerns Satan and works behind the human factors and the natural phenomena. The Lord Jesus' eyes see through man and all the natural phenomena. Man considers the persecution in the church in Smyrna as coming from Rome. Yet the Lord Jesus considered the persecutors to be not Rome, nor any other men, but Satan. The devil is the instigator of all oppositions against Christ and the Christians.</P><P>This should be a lesson for us. We should clearly identify our enemy. Many times, we have forgotten that Satan even exists! Because we do not have the experience of the ascended life, often we fail to have discerning eyes to watch over the devil and his works. Many times, we consider things that happen as natural occurrences. Actually, behind everything, there are the supernatural powers interfering! The first step of Satan's work is to hide himself. He allows man to see only the serpent in the garden of Eden, without seeing the actual person behind. We often consider that our persecutors are men, or that misunderstandings are from our brothers, that rejection is from our friends, and that sufferings are from our folks. We do not see the instigating Satan behind these people. If we really know the works of Satan, we will not blame others, but will hate Satan all the more. In this way, it will become easy for us to forgive others. If believers would be on the alert, understand the enemy's tricks in division and mistrust, and oppose him in oneness, removing all barriers, there would not be so much argument among them. Concerning this matter, we can only say this much. Let us come back to our subject.</P><P>God allows Satan to sift the saints so that their light may shine and that God's name may be glorified. It does not mean that they are not true. But tribulation and the fiery trials manifest their true nature in the same way that fire manifests the true gold. This is God's dealing in grace towards the degraded church. The world has turned sour. The saints now know that the world lies in the hands of Satan, and that it is no longer their place of rest. While the goal of the enemy is to destroy God's children, God is using all things for the benefit of His children, so that their faith and perseverance, after passing through the trials, may be complete and lacking in nothing. Although men tried to take away their lives, the Lord turned the darkness of death into the glory of the morning. A cheap bargain, an easy walk, to have two feet on two separate boats, and to live a life that is halfway between, these are the greatest temptations that Satan presents to man. God would rather see His children attacked by Satan than to have them come under his temptations. God allows Satan to persecute the saints so that they would not become worldly people among worldly ones, but would become godly ones in the congregation of the saints.</P><P>Although Satan's power is great, and although the onslaught of tribulations is severe, everything is in the hand of the Lord. Although the Lord allows Satan to apply his great pressure to the church, the Lord restricts the work of the enemy, in the same way that He handled the case of Job. "You will have tribulation ten days." Everything is in the hands of God. Everything that happens to us has been measured by God. The Lord will not let us bear any temptation above what we are able to bear. Every saint can receive tribulations as if they come from the hand of the Lord. All the power of the enemy is under the mighty hand of God. Although the enemy can persecute the saints for ten days, causing them to be purified for God's testimony, the time of his oppression and persecution is measured by God. When He says that it will be ten days, no one can say that it will be eleven days. The Lord is restraining the oppression of His enemy in the heavens. He lets us know that the roaring lion has been chained with chains. What a comfort this is for the saints to remember in the time of tribulation! Faith in the power of God is the best help for man.</P><P>What is the meaning of "ten days"? According to man's theory, a day is a year. But this day-year theory is entirely unscriptural. In other places we have proved the error of this theory. We will not repeat this here. "Ten days" in the Bible means a very short time. When the servant of Abraham was about to take away Rebekah, "her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go" (Gen. 24:55). The Israelites asked for meat in the wilderness, and Moses answered them: "Jehovah will give you meat, and you will eat. You shall not eat one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days..." (Num. 11:18-19). Nabal of Maon dealt with David in wickedness. As a result, "about ten days after...the Lord smote Nabal, that he died" (1 Sam. 25:38). Because God wanted to protect Paul from being killed on the way from Caesarea to Jerusalem, Festus, Paul's judge, "having stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea" (Acts 25:6). Although one can interpret the "ten days" to be the ten great Roman persecutions, the meaning of the words "ten days" refers only to the limitedness of their sufferings and to the fact that they were for a short time only. Thank the Lord that He restricts as well as allows the sufferings. Everything is in His hand.</P><P>"Be faithful unto death." This was the Lord's command. Although the Lord restricted the work of the devil strictly, He did not promise immediate deliverance. The Lord was not willing to deliver His people from their temporary tribulations. Rather, He desired to uphold them through death. The Lord can intervene with Satan and stop all his attacks. The Lord has the power, and He can do this. However, He demonstrated greater power in preserving the persecuted and martyred saints. We know that it was a great disappointment to the saints of old when they were pardoned by the government and spared from execution at the time of persecution. Many moving letters that have been preserved up until today were written by imprisoned saints while they watched their companions being taken to the execution ground. These letters express their sorrow and grief at not being able to share in the privilege and honor of dying for the Lord. In many cases, they did eventually receive what they hoped for, and they rejoiced greatly. This shows us how great the power of the Lord is. Amidst the enemy's extreme opposition, the Lord is able to comfort His people.</P><P>This being the case, since the Lord has put us in tribulations, and since He has allowed the enemy to try us, we should not hope or pray for the Lord to have pity on our weakness, to lead us out of the tribulations, to stop the fiery trials, and to grant us a comfortable and peaceful living. We should instead hand ourselves over faithfully to the hand of our Maker and await the completion of the carving work that tribulation works in us. God surely knows how to bring us out of these trials. We do not need to pray for God to use His power to intervene and to stop the persecuting circumstances. Instead, we should pray for God to preserve us with His power, so that we can withstand the trials of sufferings, being faithful in persecutions, and not shirking from death. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?...But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us" (Rom. 8:35, 37).</P><P>The expression "be faithful unto death" has two meanings. First, it means that to be faithful is a matter of a period of time. It means that one should be faithful up to the time he dies. "Unto death" means to continue until one dies. While one's breath lasts, he should remain faithful. Second, to be faithful is a matter of price. It means that we should remain faithful and should not give up even if it means losing our life. In this case, "unto death" means to maintain faithfulness at the cost of death. One should be willing to sacrifice his body in maintaining his faithfulness.</P><P>The word "faithful" is pistos in the original language. It means to persevere and to remain unchanged. This is in opposition to the looseness in Ephesus. Faithfulness is a matter of time. It is not difficult to be stirred up and become excited in an instant. But it is not easy to remain steady for a long time and to regard ten years as a day. It is possible for one to maintain his love for the Lord and his standard according to the Lord's word in calm and peaceful days. But it is rare and precious for one to act as "he had always done" as Daniel did (Dan. 6:10) and to be unmoved when confronted with swords, persecutions, and chains from non-Christians. To begin well is indeed commendable, but to continue well is more praiseworthy. The Lord is the faithful One, because He is the unchanging One. What He has promised He will never change. His promise stands and remains for as long as He Himself stands and remains. If there is no possibility for Him to perish, then His promise must necessarily be eternally efficacious and unchanging. If God's promise to us is unchanging, how can our promise of consecration to Him be broken? We should be faithful as God is faithful. If He has not changed, how can we change? It is indeed pleasing to the Lord to love the Lord in our youth. But it is more pleasing to the eyes of the Lord to be ripe with age and yet still not be an "old prophet" (1 Kings 13:11).</P><P>To be faithful is to have the heart of a virgin. It is to remain chaste for the Lord. To be faithful to the Lord means to be single-hearted for the Lord. It is right for us to work, to labor, to suffer, to sacrifice, to love, and to serve. Yet the most crucial question is for whom are we really doing these things? Why are we doing all these things? What the Lord considers is not simply the works, but the motive behind our works. Why are we doing all the works? The Lord does not care for the greatness of the outward works. He only questions the purity of the inward motive. If there are other mixed goals besides being for the Lord in the motive of our work, we cannot be considered faithful. Neither a craving for fame, gain, or praise from man, nor a work out of pity, or an outright absence of purpose in our work can gain us the Lord's pleasure. To be faithful in our work is a matter of the heart rather than anything else. To be faithful in our work does not mean to work hard. Rather, it means that the motive of our work is for the love of the Lord. This is the most crucial question. In that day, the judgment of our work at the judgment seat will be for the most part, if not fully, according to this standard. Every work that is not done for the Lord will be burned. Those who will gain a reward are those who have a pure and clean motive. The Lord wants us to be faithful and to be "faithful unto death." To be faithful unto death means that we should be faithful even at the time we die. Death is the last moment of our life. Although not all of us will necessarily die, and although it is possible for some of us to remain until the Lord comes back, such is the Lord's charge: to be faithful unto death, that is, to be faithful unto the end. The day of the coming of the Lord is nearer day by day. The path we are treading may be the last few miles. "For in yet a very little while the Coming One will come and will not delay. But My righteous one shall live by faith; and if he shrinks back, My soul does not delight in him" (Heb. 10:37-38). Hence, "Hold fast what you have that no one take your crown" (Rev. 3:11). This one "has" something already; he already has his crown. But there is a condition for keeping his crown, which is to be steadfast and to be unchanging. "And let us not lose heart in doing what is good, for in the proper season we will reap if we do not faint" (Gal. 6:9).</P><P>Moreover, "unto death" is not only a matter of time. It also means to be faithful even at the cost of death. Death is the greatest temptation and the last trial. If we are willing to accept the sinful terms of Satan, he is willing to promise us life. However, if we will serve the Lord faithfully, we will lose our life. To be faithful is to die, and to compromise, to withdraw, to succumb to man's will, and to lower God's standard is to live. If one is faithful to the Lord and is willing to forsake everything, his end is death. Those who are open to private intercourse with Satan in secret and who are willing to bow down before him on the mountain, when no one is around, will surely be spared from death and will be granted the blessings of this world. But those who will serve the Lord faithfully will have to sit down and count the cost. At present, the anti-religious tide is rising everywhere. We do not know where this will lead in the future. However, if the time comes for us to pour out our blood on our faith and on the words of our testimony, are we fully prepared? When our lives are threatened, will we be able to preserve our faithfulness? How do we feel when we hear the Lord say: "For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it" (Matt. 16:25)? Now is the time for us to prepare ourselves to be a martyr. So often we think that time is plentiful and the battle has just begun, and that we should save our useful body for future use. However, if we avoid the testimony of this crucial moment, but try to save our body for greater use by the Lord later, our future work before the Lord may amount to nothing. Martyrdom is the greatest work. The supreme testimony is to be faithful unto death. The blood speaks better words than the mouth. The voice of the blood is louder than any other voice, and its power greater than any other power. The Lord wants all of us to be martyrs, if not physically, at least psychologically. If we are prepared to shed our blood and to die for the sake of our faith and for the keeping of His word, and if we would not dodge to sacrifice our faithfulness, will we not be more than prepared when trials less dreadful than death come upon us? Although the Lord has not ordained that every one of us be martyrs in our body, He desires that we have the spirit of those who will not deny the Lord or disobey His word even unto death. If we encounter misunderstandings, rejections, oppositions, persecutions, and even execution for the sake of being faithful in serving the Lord, and if we are not mindful of these things, we are being faithful unto death. If through serving the Lord faithfully, we lose our worldly friends, parents, wives, wealth, fame, glory, joy, and life, and would accept these losses happily, we are being faithful unto death. How difficult this is! Does not the flesh tremble at this thought? Yet the power of the Lord is strong enough to sustain His saints.</P><P>Nevertheless, some people think that it is easier to make a clear-cut move and to die for the Lord once for all. They think that it is too difficult to suffer daily for the Lord, to bear misunderstandings and opposition for the sake of obeying the Lord and His word and for the sake of pleasing the Lord's heart. However, if one cannot live as a martyr for the Lord, he cannot die as a martyr for the Lord. If a man realizes the heart-rending pain a martyr faces at the point of death, he will not consider it an easy thing to die for the Lord. If the Lord Jesus with His perfect humanity would need to have the prayer at Gethesemane, how about the ordinary man? The life of a martyr is a life of death. If one does not live a life of death in his daily life, it would be difficult (except by the Lord's grace) to expect him to be an unretreating martyr. The Lord desires that we be living martyrs, that is, "living dead ones." Daily we are living martyrs. When the time comes for us to testify our faith with our blood, we will be able to face death readily through His grace. Towards our own fleshly life, we should always have the attitude that we are living as those who are dying, so that we would not be dominated by this life. The life that the Lord has called us to live is a life of "the living dead." If we truly have the cross working in us, we will consider this life in death as something precious, because it is this life that pleases the Lord.</P><P>The scheme of Satan is to threaten us with the fear of death and to discourage the believers with the prospect of the losing of life. He causes the believers to weigh the advantage of serving the devil against the cost of obeying the Father, and he makes them feel that one is sweet whereas the other is bitter. It is not easy for the fleshly man to be delivered from glory, position, fame, human relations, and financial losses. These things alone are enough to cause his heart to ache. If in addition to this, one is told that the giving up of life is a price to be paid for believing in the Lord, everyone would shrink and would try to escape. It is human nature to covet life and loathe death. Within every natural man, there is the ant-like nature of craving for a mere existence. Satan knows us more than we know ourselves. He knows that our weakness lies in our craving for life. At critical moments, he would make the preservation of life to be a price he will offer for us to forsake the truth. The one necessary condition to win the war with Satan is a will to defy death. "And they overcame him [Satan] because...they loved not their soul-life" (Rev. 12:11). Those saints who battle with Satan in prayer often have the experience of Satan threatening them with the losing of their life if they persist in opposing him. Hence, for one not to love his own life is the prerequisite to his war with the enemy. He is the roaring lion, who is out to make us tremble at his bearing. What he wants the saints to do the most is to drop their weapon of prayer and to stop the war. Actually, Satan and the saints can never come to peace one with another. If we have a death-defying heart, and if we will not care even if we are slaughtered and killed, Satan will have no way with us. What he is doing is to cause us to love ourselves and have pity on ourselves, so that we would not need to pay too great a price to obey the Lord; he is causing us to shed tears in secret, to have pity on ourselves and to wallow in our own sorrow during difficult times, sufferings, and dangers. If we would not love our life, how can worldly gains move our heart? If Satan cannot tempt us with anything in the world or in us, how can he exercise his maneuvering over us? In this way, we will surely win the victory.</P><P>"I will give you the crown of life." At present we are living in a time of peace. When we look back at the suffering of that day, we cannot help but tremble. However, we can see God's Spirit of glory descending on these suffering brothers. Although they suffered much for Christ, they were comforted much by Christ. It is better to have the Lord's comfort through suffering than to have neither suffering nor the Lord's comfort. Who can exhaust the sweetness of the Lord's comfort? The saints in Smyrna had heard the Lord's word to them: "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life" (Rev. 2:10). This crown is the crown of victory, because the condition for receiving this crown is to have the experience of victory. "And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible" (1 Cor. 9:25). The world awards its contending athletes, but our Lord rewards the overcomers who go to war with Satan and his army. However, one has to exercise self-control, that is, to keep God's "rules," before he can win the reward. Otherwise, he cannot overcome, and even if he does overcome outwardly, such a victory does not count. This is because "if anyone contends in the games, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully" (2 Tim. 2:5). Obedience to the word of God is the first step to victory, and it is the condition for receiving the crown. Actually, the chief condition for receiving the crown is suffering. Only those who suffer for the Lord have the possibility of receiving the crown. We can see this from the history of the Lord Jesus. "But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor"; "You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands" (Heb. 2:9, 7).</P><P>James also talked about "the crown of life" given to those who are faithful in trials. "Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him" (James 1:12). Those who suffer trials for the sake of loving the Lord will receive the crown of life as the ultimate reward. Satan threatens with death, whereas Christ promises life. Satan casts man into prison, whereas Christ gives to man the crown of life. Resurrection is the destroyer of the fear of death. Those who will lose their life for Christ's sake will find it in resurrection. All those who die for the Lord will reign with Him in the millennium (Rev. 20:4). The Lord grants special crowns to those who do special works. In the Bible, there are recorded three kinds of crowns. Here the crown of life is one of them. The crown in 1 Thessalonians 2:19 is a term, whereas the crown in 1 Corinthians 9:25 speaks of the nature of the crown. These two instances do not speak of two different kinds of crowns. Peter told the elders who faithfully care for the flock: "And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory" (1 Pet. 5:4). Paul mentioned other kinds of crowns: "Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day, and not only to me but also all those who have loved His appearing" (2 Tim. 4:8). The crown of life is given to those who suffer for the Lord and who overcome all the attacks of the enemy. The crown of righteousness is given to those who love the Lord's appearing. The crown of glory is given to those who work faithfully for the Lord, who are often despised by man and are hidden.</P><P>But what does a crown mean? On the one hand, I believe the crown mentioned here is a real crown, and that there is indeed such a thing. Everyone who fulfills the condition for receiving the crown will receive it. Just those who contended in the games received a crown on their heads, in the same way, there will be real crowns upon the bloodstained heads of the saints. Our unadorned head will one day shine with the splendor of glory. On the other hand, I believe there is hidden meaning behind the crown. A crown implies the sense of being a king. When a prince is crowned, he is henceforth a king. If the saints are crowned without any sense of reigning or ruling, of what worth is such a crown? Will the Lord attract the saints to give up their lives for Him with a mere physical crown? Although the saints' hearts are for the Lord and for pleasing Him, and although their goal is not the reward, yet the Lord will not reward in a common way. If the Lord desires to give a reward, such a reward must be of great value. According to the Bible, such a crown must refer to reigning with the Lord.</P><P>One cannot separate the crown from the reigning. It is difficult to imagine a person receiving a crown without reigning as a king. We can see this from the testimony of the Scripture: "And he took their king's crown from off his head" (2 Sam. 12:30). "Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his [the king's-v. 1] head" (Psa. 21:3). "Behold king Solomon with the crown" (S.S. 3:11). "And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown" (Ezek. 21:25-26). As the Lord was the King of suffering and wore the crown of thorns, in the same way, He is the King of glory wearing the crown of glory. Even the book of Hebrews links His crown with the ruling over all things (2:9). From the clear evidence of the Bible, we can see that the crown is a symbol for kingship. In this way, we see a very important principle: not every believer will receive a crown. In the same way, not every believer will reign with Christ. Not every believer who is qualified to receive a crown will receive the same kind of crown. In the same way, not all believers will receive the same position in glory. There are believers who will not receive any crown, and there are believers who will not reign. The losing of one's reward of reigning and the differences in glory are an important doctrine of the Bible. Those who suffer will receive the crown of life, and those who die will resurrect to reign (Rev. 20:4). Salvation may be the same for two persons, but their position in the millennium may not be the same. Those believers who will not receive a reward and who will suffer a loss are still saved (1 Cor. 3:15). There is no distinction between the grace that saved the thief on the cross and that which saved Saul of Tarsus. However, we cannot say that the reward of these two in glory is the same. Although there will be a distinction between the great vessel and the small vessel, both will be filled with the same joy and blessing. At present, of course, we see a difference in the level of spirituality among the believers. However, in that day, there will be a difference even in the position in the millennium. When we arrive in glory, there will of course be no more testings. But our present faithfulness and suffering will determine our future position. In spite of this, we cannot, of course, annul God's supreme sovereignty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Eleven</H2><P>Verse 11: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death."</P><P>As before, the word of the Holy Spirit was spoken to the churches. However, it is only to those who have an ear that the command of "let him hear" is given (Matt. 13:9). Although the Holy Spirit continually speaks, there are few who can hear His words.</P><P>Here is an excellent spiritual lesson. These seven epistles were sent by the Lord Jesus to the seven churches. At the beginning of every epistle, it says that the Lord "says." The word "says" in 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, and 14 indicates that the seven epistles were all words that the Lord Jesus spoke. But at the end of all the epistles, the letters were considered words that "the Spirit says." What does this mean? Here is a great teaching. The word of the Lord Jesus is the record of the seven epistles. When He charged John to send the epistles to each church, He began by telling John to "write" (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). Hence, the words that the Lord Jesus speaks to the churches are the words that John wrote. In other words, they become the record of the Bible, the text of Revelation chapters two and three. The Lord Jesus has spoken; His words have been recorded and are written in the Bible. But now the Holy Spirit still must speak to the churches through these words. The Holy Spirit must speak to the church again from the written word. The Holy Spirit does not speak of Himself. Rather, He reiterates in man's heart the written word. When we read the Bible, we have to pay attention to this matter. It is true that in the Bible, we have the word of the Lord and the word of God already. However, we must still ask the Holy Spirit to speak the words within us. The reading of the Bible is for the purpose of receiving the Holy Spirit's speaking. If we only read the Bible but do not have the speaking of the Holy Spirit, our reading will be in vain. We must allow the Holy Spirit to speak His word through the written text. God has spoken in the Bible already. But we must allow the Holy Spirit to speak to us again from God's spoken word. Everyone who waits on God faithfully has the experience of the Holy Spirit speaking to him through the Bible. The word of God, the Bible, is general. We must have the Holy Spirit to appoint certain of God's words for our application according to our need. When we read the Bible, we realize its general goodness. But when the Holy Spirit speaks to us from within, we receive unspeakable teachings, rebukes, comforts, and encouragements. When the Holy Spirit speaks to us through one or two verses, we receive special revelation. What we previously thought we have understood is now seen as being superficial. Now, it seems as if the heart and marrow of the Scripture is opened to us. Hence, in the reading of the Bible, it is not a matter of the quantity read, or the familiarity that counts; neither are we reading for the sake of knowledge. The reading of the Bible is for the purpose of receiving the speaking of the Holy Spirit. As the resurrected Savior expounded the Scripture to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus and caused their hearts to burn within them, in the same way the Spirit who has been sent also opens the Bible to all the believers, enlightening the word and pricking the believers' hearts with it. When we realize this, we will prepare ourselves by prayer and meditation. In this way, the Holy Spirit will be able to speak to us the words of the Bible.</P><P>"He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death." This is a promise. Those who overcome have a secured position. The second death, which is the death of judgment, shall not hurt them. The second death is the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8). Nothing can hurt these ones except the first death of the physical body. Hence, we do not have to be afraid of the first death. It is only a servant that leads us to God. The Lord is the ancient wood which was cast into the bitter waters at Marah. He Himself has passed through the pain of death and has turned it into sweetness.</P><P>To be free from the hurt of the second death means to be free from the hurt of the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14). The lake of fire is what we commonly know as hell. Those who will not be hurt of the lake of fire will have a part in the first resurrection; they are qualified to enjoy the blessing of the millennium. This can be proved from Revelation: "Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years" (20:6). Here we see two blessed ends of the overcomers. Negatively, they are saved from all God's wrath and will not be touched at all by it. Positively, they will receive a crown and will reign with Christ for a thousand years.</P><P>These promises, as do all the other promises in the other epistles, divide the believers in the church into overcomers and those who are overcome. These promises are particular. Not every overcomer will receive all the promises. Only by overcoming certain trials will one receive certain particular promises related to those trials. The promise here is given to those who are imprisoned and killed for Christ. The distinction between the overcomers and those who are overcome is fully attested to by the experience of the church. We know that there have been many sincere ones who believed in Christ for eternal life but shrank back and denied the Lord at difficult times through their physical weaknesses. It is possible, though it ought not be, that regenerated believers may deny Christ. The distinction between the overcomers and those who are overcome is an unremovable fact. If Peter was not regenerated at an earlier time, at least by the time he confessed that Christ was the Son of God (Matt. 16:16) he was regenerated already (1 John 5:1). However, he denied Christ with an oath. We thank the Lord that at crucial moments, there are indeed overcomers. However, there are also many who have been overcome and have retreated. The persecutors always say: "Give up your faith or you will die!" Those who insist on their faith and who die graciously overcome and glorify God. Moreover, they strengthen their brothers' hearts. But if they deny the most holy name of the Lord, they fail and are overcome, and God and the destiny of His church are put to shame. According to the text here, only those who have overcome and who have not denied the Lord can escape the hurt of the second death, which is hell. Those who fail and who have denied the Lord will suffer the hurt of the second death. This is the word of the Bible, and it is clear enough. Yet does this mean that a saved person will perish forever just because he has denied the Lord? No, this is not the biblical teaching, nor is it our teaching. On the one hand, the Bible teaches us that a Christian once saved, is forever saved. All those who have believed the Lord Jesus as their personal Savior are eternally saved. They will by no means perish at all. If a saint could perish forever, this would diminish the merit of the cross of Christ, and would annul God's promise completely. However, on the other hand, we cannot say that a sinning Christian will have no punishment other than the losing of his reward (1 Cor. 3:15). As far as I know, the Bible teaches us on the one hand the eternal salvation of the saints, but on the other hand it also teaches us of the punishment for the failing and sinning Christian. We should believe in all the words of the Bible. In our exposition of the Scripture, we should give the biblical truth its rightful place. We must not cut off portions of the Scripture to fit our theory of exposition. Those people whose minds are more inclined to righteousness explain away the Scriptures on eternal salvation. They claim that if a Christian sins again, he will be lost again. Those people whose minds are bent more towards grace explain away the texts that cover God's judgment on the sinning Christians. They claim that Christians will always be saved. The former group despises God's precious promises, and emphasizes God's warning to the defeated believers. The latter changes the meaning of the texts by their way of exposition, claiming that God's warnings are issued not to the saved believers but to the nominal ones only. The former ones do not understand the doctrine of regeneration and the grace of redemption, whereas the latter ones through their prejudice subconsciously make their exposition a kind of alteration. Both are wrong. We cannot go into detail concerning this matter. Here we can only discuss it in brief.</P><P>(1) According to the biblical teaching, we know that as soon as a sinner receives the Lord Jesus as his personal Savior, and as soon as he believes that the Lord Jesus has died for him on the cross, he is eternally saved. The following are the proofs: (1) "He who believes has eternal life" (John 6:47). Once we believe, we have it, and what we have is eternal life. Since it is eternal life, there is no possibility for one to perish halfway. (2) What the Lord Jesus accomplished on the cross was "an eternal redemption" (Heb. 9:12). Hence, every sinner who trusts in Him receives the efficaciousness of this eternal redemption. As such, the efficaciousness of the blood of the Lord Jesus is eternal with those who believe in Him. (3) The prayer of the Lord Jesus as the high priest is the preserving power for the believers to be saved to the uttermost. "Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them" (Heb. 7:25). If a believer should perish, it would mean that the Lord Jesus' prayer had lost its power. All those who think this way are blaspheming Him! (4) Once a sinner believes in the Lord Jesus, he receives the Holy Spirit and is joined to the Lord in life, becoming a member of the Body of Christ. If a believer could still perish, the Body of the Lord Jesus would become crippled. "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1). (5) The believers are God's gifts to the Lord Jesus (John 10:29). If believers could perish, then what the Father gives to the Son would be something that is not eternal. This is unimaginable. If God's grace to the world is without repentance, how can He withdraw what He has given to His own beloved Son? (6) Since salvation is not received through works (Eph. 2:1, 8-9), it cannot be lost through works. (7) If believers could perish, all the New Testament Scriptures that assert the Lord's preserving power would become absurd. (8) When a sinner believes in the Lord Jesus to be his Savior, he is begotten of God and has become God's child (John 1:12-13). Since he is begotten, he cannot be unbegotten again. Once he has become a child, no matter how much he sins, he will always be a child. Since what he has received is eternal life, such a relationship can never be severed. (9) Those who are saved by God in this age have been predestinated by God before the foundation of the world. If we admit that the matter of salvation is under God's sovereign hand, it is impossible for a person predestinated by God to salvation to be lost again. "And those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified" (Rom. 8:30). God predestinated in the past, and He will glorify in the future. Now He is calling and justifying. The believers are guaranteed to be saved into eternal glory. (10) Look again at the promise of the Lord Jesus, where this question is considered to be settled: "My sheep...shall by no means perish forever" (John 10:27-28). Once a person has become the Lord's sheep, he will by no means perish forever. This is spoken by the Lord Himself. The reason that one cannot perish forever is (a) "No one shall snatch them out of My hand" (John 10:28), and (b) "No one can snatch them out of My Father's hand" (John 10:29). From these points we can see that the question of salvation for every believer is settled and fully secured. Praise the Lord!</P><P>(2) After a believer is saved, if he sins and transgresses by accident, he should come immediately before God to confess his sins. God will forgive his sins based on the work of the cross. We should differentiate between the condition of forgiveness for the sinners and for the believers. The sinners are forgiven through believing; the saints are forgiven through confessing. First John 1:9 says: "If we [the Christians] confess our sins [the unique condition], He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." A sinner cannot be forgiven by mere confessing, whereas a saint cannot be forgiven by mere believing. When a saint sins, and when he comes to God to confess his sins, based on the work of the Lord Jesus, he will immediately be forgiven. In the future at the judgment seat, this sin will no longer condemn him. However, here is a problem. It is true that there are many believers who have confessed their wrongdoings and have asked God for forgiveness. Yet there are still many who die with their sins unconfessed and never repented of. Shall these ones also be eternally saved and not come under God's judgment? Sin is sin. God must judge sin as sin and punish sin as sin. If a believer has not confessed his sins, he will not be able to have the effectiveness of the cross of the Lord applied to those particular sins. As a result, he will have to bear his own sins. God judges and punishes sin, whether it is in the sinner or in the believer.</P><P>A saved Christian will be punished. For this, there are the following proofs: (1) "For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit...to renew themselves again...It is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned" (Heb. 6:4, 6, 8). Such a one is surely saved and has surely believed. Yet he will still experience the punishment of burning. (2) "For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries" (Heb. 10:26-27). The words "there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins" indicate that there was a sacrifice for sins before. Hence, this proves that such a person is saved. However, because such a one has sinned willfully, he will suffer the fervor of fire which is about to consume the adversaries. When a believer sins with the sinners, he will be punished with the sinners. (3) "If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned" (John 15:6). There is still the danger for those who have already become a branch to be cast out, to become dry, and to be cast into the fire. (4) "Whoever says to his brother...Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire" (Matt. 5:22). Since both are brothers, both are saved ones. Yet the one who sins by reviling the other shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire. (5) "Every one therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens; but whoever shall deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens" (Matt. 10:32-33). The "every one" here is the "you" in verse 31, who are the disciples. It is possible for those who are already disciples of the Lord to be denied by Him. (6) "My friends, Do not fear those who kill the body and afterward have nothing more that they can do. But I will show you whom you should fear: fear Him who, after killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, fear this One" (Luke 12:4-5). The Lord's friends are the saved believers. Yet, among them some will be cast into Gehenna. (7) "Many will say to Me in that day [the day of the judgment seat], Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you [lit., I never justified you]. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness" (Matt. 7:22-23). Those who hear the Lord's word but do not obey and who work according to their own will, though they will not perish, they will hear the Lord's severe words to them. (8) "And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 25:30). Those slaves who have received the gift of the Holy Spirit have become members in the Body of Christ. Yet, through their digging of the earth and hiding of their talent, they misjudged the Lord and were cast midway into the outer darkness. (9) "But if that slave says in his heart, My master is delaying his coming, and begins to beat the male servants and the female servants and to eat and to drink and become drunk, the master of that slave...will cut him asunder, and will appoint his portion with the unbelievers. And that slave who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes; but he who did not know, yet did things worthy of stripes, will receive few lashes. But to every one to whom much has been given, much will be required from him; and to whom much has been committed, they will ask of him all the more" (Luke 12:45-48). The slaves to whom the Lord has "given" and committed something are the saved ones. Yet through their disobedience to God's will, they will be cut in two by the Lord. (10) "He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death" (Rev. 2:11). Those who do not overcome will be hurt of the second death, which is the hurt of hell. From these points we can see that if a saved Christian sins and does not confess his sin, he will not experience the effectiveness of the cross, but will suffer serious punishments. God is love; yet He is also righteous.</P><P>In conclusion, the Bible teaches us that believers are saved forever. But the Bible also teaches us that believers will be punished for their sins. We believe and know that the Bible does not contradict itself, and God's work does not contradict itself. The eternal salvation of the believers and their punishment are two simultaneously existing doctrines.</P><P>After reading the second group of Scriptures, we can see that other than the "outer darkness" which has no part in the cloud of glory in the air, there is mentioned the Gehenna of fire, Gehenna itself, and the hurt of the second death. In addition, fire is mentioned many times. These Scriptures lead us to believe that there is the possibility for believers to go to Gehenna. Gehenna is the place of punishment for the saints' sins. In the future, believers will be divided into at least three classes, those who will be rewarded, those who will receive no reward, and those who will be punished. The sinning ones will suffer punishment. But does this mean that a Christian will perish forever? No, this is not the teaching of the Bible. If we combine the first group of Scriptures with the second, we will see that since salvation is eternal for the saints, things such as Gehenna cannot be applied to them forever. They will experience these things in a different way than the sinners will. Hence, we can logically conclude that after a sinning believer is judged at the judgment seat, he will go temporarily to Gehenna to be punished but will eventually be saved. This is not the purgatory that the Roman Catholic Church speaks of. Gehenna is for punishment rather than for the cultivation of the believers' spirituality, as purgatory claims to be. Neither is this the so-called "restoration theology," a heresy which asserts that all sinners will be saved after they have suffered punishment. Here we are only talking about a group of saved believers.</P><P>The words "shall by no means perish forever" in John 10:28 will solve the problem of all those who do not believe in eternal salvation for believers. However, the same words serve to prove our assertion. In the original language, the words do not mean, as some versions have put them, "shall never perish." Rather, they mean "shall by no means perish forever." This clearly shows us our position.</P><P>According to the Bible, the millennium is a special age. This age will usher in God's eternal kingdom, which is an age when righteousness reigns. Hence, everything related to the millennium is in the principle of righteousness. A sinning believer will suffer punishment during this one thousand years. This can be seen from Luke 18. The Gospel of John, from its beginning to its end, tells us that eternal life comes by faith. This is very important. However, the Lord Jesus tells us in the Gospel of Luke that if a man leaves behind everything, he shall receive "in the coming age, eternal life" (Luke 18:30). This word is so different from the words in John! Here it does not say that one will receive as soon as he believes. Rather, it says that one has to leave behind everything and to give up his love for the world before he can receive eternal life in the coming age. Otherwise, he will not receive it. Therefore, we have to realize that there is a difference between "the coming age," the future, and now. Our present age is the age of grace. The coming age is the age of the millennium. The future is not settled yet. Hence, there is no contradiction between John's word and Luke's word. John speaks of the common condition for eternal life, which is faith. Luke speaks of the eternal life in the age of righteousness in the millennium. Those believers who love the world will not receive the eternal life then. Instead they will be punished.</P><P>When we see such a sober teaching, we will become careful. God's grace is sufficient for us. God has no intention for us to suffer punishment. However, sins that are committed and unconfessed will prevent the Lord's grace, which is brought in through the cross, from coming to us. As a result, we will suffer punishment. How dreadful is Gehenna! How evil is sin! What a fearful thing it is that believers are liable to the Gehenna of fire! We should trust in the cross. The things we are speaking of here are God's best warnings to keep the saints watchful and careful. If God's word suffers any loss through man's utterance, may the Lord forgive us!</P><P>Let us come back to Revelation. How pitiful it is for believers to be overcome by the enemy through loving their life! Although those who faithfully serve the Lord will lose their lives, beyond the first death they will no longer be hurt by the second death. What a promise this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>APPENDIX-<br>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</H2><P>Ephesus depicts the first era of the church on earth. Therefore, Smyrna depicts the second era of the church on earth. Although we cannot say definitely that the ten days of tribulation refer to the ten great persecutions of the Roman Caesars, yet they must at least hint at the tribulations of the day. We cannot say definitely that the great persecutions are ten in number. However, the time when the Roman Caesars persecuted the church was very near the time of Smyrna-from the time Domitian ruled until the end of Diocletian's reign was over two hundred years. The age of Smyrna ended approximately A.D. 313. During that period, we have the age of persecution for the church. Although the church suffered greater persecutions in other ages in addition, they were limited to one region only and were not wide-spread. The greatness of the Roman Empire enhanced its power to persecute the Christians and left no place of escape for the believers.</P><P>After reading Foxe's Book of Martyrs, we in the twentieth century cannot help but be baffled. The sufferings that the believers went through at that time were those that no human flesh can withstand. The tortures we see in our history cannot be compared with one-tenth of the cruelty of the punishments these ones experienced in those days. The method of persecutions and the steps of torture for the criminals then was a great invention of the day! Ways so cruel as to surpass the human imagination were used and were applied to the saints. This makes us wonder what extremities Antichrist will use to persecute the Christians during the great tribulation! Surely they will be more severe and more unbearable. What a pity for those who will not give up the world now but who will try to no avail in that day when suffering comes! Now is the time for us to overcome. It is most pitiful that believers have to pass through God's severe chastisement before they will give up the world!</P><P>When we consider the faithfulness of the martyrs of the day, we cannot help but aspire after them. Many believers aspired and even craved to die for the Lord. Some believers had to suffer tortures for a few months before they died. Under such extreme pain, they had no complaints. On the contrary, they endured joyfully, bearing excellent testimony for the Lord. Although they could gain their lives by one word of denial, they refused to do it. When we read of the severity of their trials, we cannot imagine ourselves being put in the same trials and being as faithful as they were. Some sisters had their parents pleading, their lovers imploring, their relatives persuading, and their children wailing before them. They were placed before the wild beasts and subjected to hunger. Yet they were not moved in their hearts at all and did not give in a bit. They would rather be shredded into pieces and wasted in tortures than to deny the name of the Lord they loved. The world could go away. Lovers could go away. Their children and their lives could go away. Yet they would not give up the Lord Jesus. John's disciple Polycarp was one of the elders of Ephesus. At the age of eighty-six, he was taken away by the Roman government and was promised release if he would blaspheme the Lord Jesus. His answer was a timeless motto: "I have served Him for eighty-six years. He has never forsaken me. How can I forsake Him merely for the sake of preventing my death?"</P><P>However, the blood of the saints is the seed of the truth. Many times, the Roman soldiers who did the torturing with jesting saw the endurance, joy, love, forgiveness, courage in facing death, and faithfulness in purpose of the saints in tribulations, and they were moved with curiosity. Out of curiosity they investigated and were greatly moved by the Holy Spirit. As a result, many times, while the saints were being burned in flames, and while the ashes were still falling, the torturer picked up the same faith and stepped in to suffer the same punishment. The Lord's cross draws man to it (John 12), in like manner does the saints' cross draw men to the Lord's cross. This influence is not regional, nor accidental. One famous historian noted that if all the Christians at that time were removed from the great Roman Empire, the population of the Empire would be greatly reduced. This shows us that though the force of persecution was great at that time, the power of the saints' salvation was also great. Many hardened hearts cannot be penetrated through by anything else except by the blood. The Savior has shed His blood already. Those who preach His shedding of the blood should themselves also shed blood.</P><P>However, although the tribulations of the day turned the saints to a greater love for the Lord, these tribulations did not make the ordinances and teachings of the church pure. It is true that the church was very faithful in opposing many heresies already. This is to be commended. However, the Judaistic teaching originated much earlier, and we have no way to find out its way of propagation or the names of its proponents. When we turn to the world histories which are void of God's inspiration, we see that changes were brought in early on. Yet there was no record as to how things were being changed. Moreover, because the Judaistic practices and works were so prevailing already, it is difficult for us to place the age of this epistle to be at the time of Rome's persecution of the church. It is hard for us to believe that such a faithful and suffering church would succumb to the Judaistic teachings. The fact of the matter is this: history concerning the early church was already rare from the start. Those histories that were written passed through many centuries during which the truth was rejected. Considering this, can we hope to find in them any record of the struggle of the Judaistic teachers? Since it was the practice then and in subsequent ages to attach prominent names to the authorship of fabricated works, it is hard to imagine that there were no alterations in early church history to the record of the struggle with the Judaistic teachers. The Judaistic teaching was necessarily very prevailing at that time. However, church history must contain the record of the church's struggle with it. Moreover, the Lord's word here (Rev. 2:9) causes us to believe that there were struggles at that time. We do believe in one thing: that we have to wait until a future time before a true account of church history will appear. Perhaps now it is only recorded before God. Nevertheless, we know that the Nazarenes and the Ebionites were Judaistic religions of the day. Their source, existence, and end were recorded clearly in Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The change in church organization and its deviation from the scriptural principles were also a result of the influence of this teaching. Another proof is that the first fifteen overseers of Jerusalem were all circumcised Jews, and the congregation there all kept both the law of Moses and the teachings of Christ as well.</P><P>If we consider these ones who called themselves Jews to be the Jews in the flesh, we can see that it is also a fact that they persecuted the Christians. Even while Polycarp was being burned, the Jews were busily helping to prepare the stakes.</P><P>We have seen the rising tide of the Judaistic teaching. What we have to do is to lift God's gospel of grace up high, and reject those who mix the law with grace. We must not take upon ourselves the heavy yoke of the law and give up our freedom in Christ. If we keep the law, it will not save us. Moreover, it will not increase our standing before God one bit. On the contrary, we will fall from grace. We are here to obey Christ, and not the law.</P><P>We have also seen how the saints suffered for the Lord. Because they had left their first love, they were chastised by God. We must not wait until the great tribulation comes, when God chastises us, to give up everything to follow the Lord. God has prepared everything on the cross for us to overcome through the Lord. If we do not receive God's grace now, we will receive His stripes in the future. If it pleases God that we suffer for Him, then for His love's sake, we should be faithful unto death to glorify His name. Other saints have suffered. How can we barter for ease? Suffering is the pathway to glory. May we be faithful and watchful together in the way ahead of us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>SUB-SECTION THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PERGAMOS-<br>THE CORRUPTED CHURCH<br>(2:12-17)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Twelve</H2><P>Verse 12: "And to the messenger of the church in Pergamos write: These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword."</P><P>In the church in Smyrna we saw that although Satan attacked the church, its love increased through persecution. Now persecution has stopped, but Satan's wiles have prevailed. If he cannot persecute us outwardly, he will try to deceive us inwardly and will corrupt God's children. Oppression and temptation are two tools the enemy uses to oppose God. These two things are manipulated dexterously by Satan's hand. If he fails in one, he will use the other. This is the way he dealt with our Lord. First, he led Him into the wilderness. When his plan failed, he was forced to kill Him on the cross. Still, he failed, and his Adversary, our Lord, won the full victory. He dealt with Paul the same way. He wanted to collaborate with Paul to damage the Lord's holy work, and when that failed, he cast Paul into prison (Acts 16). He is dealing with the church the same way. When he persecuted Smyrna, it became more zealous. Therefore, he changed his strategy and tried to entice Pergamos with the worldly snare. It is a pity that Pergamos fell into his trap and lost its separation from the world.</P><P>The church in Pergamos reveals to us the condition after Smyrna. God cares for His children. This is why, when He sees them departing from their first love, He allows persecution to come upon them so that they would not backslide. This goal was accomplished for a brief while, but not long after this, the reviving power of the church was lost again! It degraded again, and the degradation became more severe than before. The church has become worldly! There are many similarities between the situation at the time of the judges and the condition of the church now. The book of Judges is a book of revivals. The Israelites failed in Canaan and were overcome by the enemies. Yet God in His grace constantly delivered them. But the amazing thing is that after every deliverance, which can be considered a revival, God's people failed once more. Their resulting condition was far worse than before their revivals! Is this not the same with the history of the church? In His love and mercy God would time and again revive His children with the Holy Spirit so that they would receive life once more and would grow in spiritual stature and that they would obey God's word more. But it is a pity that no sooner does the tide of revival pass away than a renowned church falls back once again. Hence, although God halted the backsliding of Ephesus, in the church in Smyrna this did not last for long. Now Pergamos is before us.</P><P>Here, though the matter is not our subject, I would mention in passing the type of the Israelites and how it can be applied to the condition of the denominations today. The confusion at the time of the judges can be seen from the expression "every man did that which was right in his own eyes" (Judg. 21:25). After this period of doing everything right according to one's own eyes, we see the people taking Saul as king. After this there was David and then Solomon. In the current denominations everyone indeed does "that which was right in his own eyes." Man's tradition, psychology, preference, theology, creed, ordinance, and choice become the goal of all denominational organizations. God's word is cast behind or is relegated a position equal to human work. Many would not obey the "thus saith the Lord" but would rather concede that ordinances for the preservation of order in the denominations be maintained. We are not surprised that this is the natural consequence of apostasy. In the end, as a whole, the people will accept Antichrist as king. This is Saul of the Old Testament. However, our David, the warring Christ, will come again, will war, and will win. In the end He will be like Solomon and reign as the King of peace for a thousand years. Now is the time for us to be faithful.</P><P>If the church has not left the first love, no temptation will make it slide back. However, when the first love is lost, there is no degradation that the church cannot experience.</P><P>The word "Pergamos" has two meanings in the original language. The first is "complete marriage." This means that the church has dropped its present sojourning nature and has instead married the world. The church is supposed to be a virgin espoused to Christ. How can the church be so if it is married before Christ comes? This must be the marriage between the church and the world. It is not a surprise though, because it is the result of a long period of romance. According to the Lord's word, Christians and the world should be diametrically opposed to one another. Our remaining in the world is for the purpose of testifying to the wrongdoing of the world that has crucified Christ. This is why the Lord said that "in the world you have affliction" (John 16:33). If the believers maintain their stand of being out of the world and against the world, they will enjoy an eternal Smyrna. If the world has not persecuted the Christians, it must be for one of the two following reasons: either the world has become the church, or the church has become the world. The present world may be prosperous materially speaking, but is its attitude toward Christ different from that of twenty centuries ago? If the world has not changed for the better to become the church, we have to admit that the church has joined hands with the world and has married it. Hence, the church has become the world!</P><P>This word has another meaning, which is "high tower." The result of the church being married to the world is the gaining of an honorable position. This was its goal anyway. Now this goal is reached. How could cross-bearing followers of the humble Nazarene ever have seen the good that man now enjoys? "We have become a high tower for the whole world to admire. Is this not a great boost to the Lord's truth?" But then, the position of a high tower puts the student higher than the teacher and the servant higher than the master. Since the world calls our master one who is demon-possessed, what mockery should we receive? If all that our Lord received were the thorned crown and the wooden cross, what should we have? If the manger was His birthplace, should the high tower be our dwelling? Those who love the Lord should know how to answer these questions. The high tower cannot be compared to the spirit of the rejected cross. Can the high tower and the cross go parallel one to the other and not clash with each other? In reality, those who marry the world can hardly bear the spirit of the humble, painful, common, and poor cross. The high tower is but a symbol of all the great things. The church can bounce and rejoice on the broad way of the world. However, the Lord will judge.</P><P>We have mentioned before that the way the Lord addresses each church is intimately related to the condition of that church. Since the church in Pergamos is worldly, the Lord revealed Himself as "He who has the sharp two-edged sword." Man opposed Smyrna with his sword, but the Lord opposed Pergamos with His sword. Formerly it was Nero who was drawing the sword. This time it was Christ who was drawing the sword. The Lord Jesus wanted them to know that as much as the sword of the world was fearsome, His sword was even more fearsome. If man is fearsome, is not God more fearsome? As His messenger had dealt with Balaam, in the same way He Himself would deal with the church who followed Balaam. This is the tool He uses to deal with the apostate church. How different this letter is from the last! There the believers were going to die, and the Lord revealed Himself as the resurrection. Here He was the judge with the two-edged sword. In Smyrna He had the authority of life. Here He had the authority of death. To those who did not love their life, He demonstrated His tenderness and loving sympathy, but to those who loved their life and who were joined to the world, He showed His sharp sword. If a man tries to avoid the enemy's persecution, he will instead find the punishment of Christ.</P><P>The first church tells us of the forsaking of the first love. The second church tells us of the enemy's persecution. The question now is not persecution but the enemy's welcome. The smile of Satan is more dreadful than his anger. What a pity that many Samsons have braved the fierce Philistines on the battlefield only to find their locks of power shorn through sleeping on the lap of Delilah and thus becoming no different than an ordinary man. If God chastises, it means that He is still doing something. If God gives up, though the flesh can enjoy comfortably and the conscience is set to rest, danger is near! "Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone" (Hosea 4:17). This is most tragic! Now we have the finer judgment of Christ. These ones utilize their evil teachings to support their walk with the world and cover their evil deeds with false holiness. The word on the removal of the lampstand is no longer suitable here. God did not call them to return to their first love. This was impossible already for the whole church had become lost. Other than the promise for the individual lover of the Lord to take pleasure in the Lord, there was no other promise given.</P><P>This church no longer had the ability to differentiate that which needs differentiation. This is why the Lord told them that He is the One with the two-edged sword. The meaning of the two-edged sword can be seen from Hebrews 4:12-13: "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account." The reason the Lord spoke to the messenger of Pergamos in this way was to show the church that its spiritual condition is naked before Him and that His word will expose our true condition.</P><P>Moreover, this sword also symbolizes judgment. The Lord's word pierces through all hidden things. At the same time, His word also judges, condemns, and executes judgments. Later the Lord used the same sword to smite the nations (Rev. 19). Hence, the meaning is obvious. This is the weapon with which the Lord Jesus judges and executes judgments. As man's sword is used for cutting away, in the same way the word of God is used to exterminate all opposers. Naturally, the Lord will not use this to kill His own people. Yet, the Lord called those who were in the same position as the Nicolaitans to repent, or else they would face war (2:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Thirteen</H2><P>Verse 13: "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; and you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."</P><P>The word for "throne" is thronos. The throne is a symbol of reigning. Satan's throne is not in hell for hell is only Satan's prison. It is not the sphere where he exercises his authority. Satan's territory is the present world. The world is the place where he reigns. The Bible says, "The whole world lies in the evil one" (1 John 5:19). The Bible calls him expressly "the ruler of the world" (John 14:30). Paul also called him "the god of this age" (2 Cor. 4:4). Hence, the place "where Satan's throne is" is the present world.</P><P>The church is living in the world! How strange this is! The hostile world is no longer driving away the church, making the church feel that it is different from the world. The church has now fallen into the bosom of the world. The church is no longer the scum (1 Cor. 4:13), much less a pest (Acts 24:5)! Now it has gained a position and is honored by man. The church is living in the world where Satan reigns as king. To "dwell" is to make home. It is no longer a guest in the world but has become an important member in the world. The church has made its home in the world! How different this is from its Lord! Its Lord spent His first night on earth in a manger in an inn. He spent His last night on earth also in an inn. (The word "guest room" in Luke 22:11 is the same word in the original language as the "inn" in Luke 2:7.) The Lord Jesus was a traveller on earth from beginning to end. Even after He died, He was still buried in another person's tomb. He was truly a guest. He expects His church to be nothing more than a guest on earth. This is why He put the one He has saved into an inn (Luke 10:34). He expects to find at His coming back all His saved ones in that inn. However, it is a pity that the church has lost its sojourning and pilgrimming nature! There is a difference between "being" in the world and "living" in the world. In the former case the person is just a sojourner. In the latter case the person is a citizen of the world. This is a moral issue. Since it has joined itself to the world, there is the possibility to receive heresy. When the flesh dwells in the world, there is no danger, but it is pitiful for the heart and the spirit to make home in the world.</P><P>The Savior admitted that the circumstance was difficult. He knew that the place where the church was was dangerous. Sin and idols were everywhere. He realized the predicament facing the church. That is why He said: "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is." The Lord Jesus glories in His martyrs. This is why He said: "Antipas, My witness, My faithful one" (Rev. 2:13). Neither the Bible nor history mention the name Antipas. However, this is the name of one who truly suffers for the Lord. Although man does not know him, the Lord mentioned His name specifically. He mentioned His faithfulness. What a commendation this is! How precious is the death of the saints in the eyes of the Lord! The Lord knows those who are His. He knows who has passed through difficulties and sufferings for His sake. Although man does not know Antipas, the Good Shepherd knows the name of His sheep. What a comforting thought this is! Although there was loneliness, although man's eyes did not see him, although persecution persisted until death, although he had nothing left behind in the world, and although historians would not even save a space for his name, the Lord's eyes saw and His heart remembered; He praised and commended. This is truly "A garden inclosed...a spring shut up, a fountain sealed" (S.S. 4:12). The world could not touch him for he was the apple of the Lord's eye. It was not easy for him to give anything to the world. He only knew the Lord and sought only to please Him. He is a lonely martyr, one whom the Lord praised. We thank and praise the Lord that He never forgets any of His nameless, hidden servants. Everyone who suffers for Him, whoever he may be, is known by Him. He puts all of them in His heart. Lord, how numerous are Your thoughts toward me! In the coming kingdom, all those who suffer for the Lord will receive glory. The life that we lose now will be gained back in the future. This is not only true for Antipas alone but for all the unnamed heroes who are martyrs for the Lord in life or in death. They will all shine as the sun.</P><P>"Who was killed among you, where Satan dwells." The Lord saw the condition of Pergamos. Satan not only had a throne there; he was personally dwelling there. It is hard for one not to find red blood stains and broken bones before a lion's den. It is not surprising to find persecution at the place where Satan dwells. Satan is a murderer from the beginning. He is the same from the first day until now.</P><P>"In the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells." To be a witness, one who is true, who stirs up the wrath of Satan, and who cripples the kingdom of Satan, will necessarily bring out the enemy's persecution. Unless a witness can cripple Satan, he is not a true witness. A true witness will surely stir up the wrath of the enemy. However, at times, even when we witness, we will not be killed. Antipas was not only a witness but a faithful witness. All those who witness faithfully will be persecuted. Satan is not afraid of our empty words. What he cannot stand is a faithful witness. To be a witness alone does not seem to require much price, but to be a faithful witness requires one to risk his own life. The price is here. Who is willing to pay it?</P><P>"You hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas...who was killed." The Lord allowed difficulty to come upon them. This is why the Lord did not interrogate them. He is a merciful Lord. He remembers His mercy in His judgment. He tried His best to commend the church. No merit of His children goes unnoticed and unappreciated. He recognized the difficulty of their circumstance. He praised them for holding fast His name and not denying His faith.</P><P>"You hold fast My name and have not denied My faith." They did not deny the faith that was once delivered to the saints. They were still holding fast everything that the Lord's name implies. This name implies the glory of the Lord's person. They did not forget the Lord's person because of His body of flesh. Although their eyes had not seen the Lord, they believed in the Lord's divinity. They held fast the Lord's name and did not deny His faith. How incomplete it is for such a thing to come from a worldly church! Yet the Lord does not annul any merit of man. This is why He commends. The first half of the Lord's commendation was stronger than the second half, for to "hold fast" is much better than to "not deny." Nevertheless, both to "hold fast" and to "not deny" are not easy matters. Even this is good enough to make the Lord grateful. This is why He delighted in mentioning them and praising them. Can the Lord say this word to the church today? What do we see today? Do we not see Christ's person being rejected everywhere? Man extols the twentieth century culture, but is not the world of the twentieth century still the throne of Satan? But here was an Antipas. The meaning of his name is "against everyone." He, like Stephen, sealed the witness he bore with his own blood. He is one who refuses to keep silent. Neither the power of hell, nor the persecutions of the world, nor the danger of life can stop him from opposing everyone. Where are those witnesses today who will testify faithfully for the Lord and who will not love their life unto death?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Fourteen</H2><P>Verse 14: "But I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication."</P><P>"But I have a few things against you." The words of praise are over. Now comes the word of rebuke! What is the teaching of Balaam? What characteristics does Balaam have? Because of his greed, he set his mind to serve the king of Moab and to curse God's Israel. God had stopped him already, yet his heart was moved by the high place and the offer of gold, and he went to inquire of God again. In the end, he went. Although many of the things he said were true, he said it not by will and not from his heart. By taking this way, he was bit by bit going downhill until he was clearly aligned with the world, scheming with the world to stumble God's people. Is this not the case with the present church? To barter God's truth is to go the way of Balaam.</P><P>What then is the teaching of Balaam? Through Balaam's mouth, God told the Israelites that they should dwell alone and should not be reckoned among the nations. Yet Balaam taught the Israelites to remove the wall of partition between them and the nations so that they would be joined to the Midianites and would worship the idols and sin together. Hence, the teaching of Balaam is the alliance with the world. The result of this teaching is to take away the church's qualification as a Nazarite and its zeal in loving the Lord.</P><P>The world and the church should be separated by a deep gulf. Yet the teaching of Balaam causes Balak to build a floating bridge across it so that the church and the world can be joined together and can love one another. The way of Balaam was to cause Balak to utilize the Moabite women to draw the Israelites to worship idols and to commit fornication. Because the church is joined to the world, everything has become comfortable and easy. Comfort and ease lead to looseness. This is why the teaching of Balaam was able to prevail. The eating of things offered to idols and fornication are the sins which resulted from Balaam's teaching. The Holy Spirit had forewarned the church through Paul to stay away from these two particular sins. Please read 1 Corinthians 6, 8, and 10. Formerly, these two sins caused the Israelites to become desolate. At this point they corrupted the chastity of the church.</P><P>Outwardly speaking, Balaam was God's prophet, one who was near to God. However, he tried to use his power for the purpose of gaining money. He himself had no animosity against the Israelites, but his own belly was his own god. When this god of his belly had a demand, he helplessly complied to curse the Israelites. He used sin and reveling to lower the standard of the Israelites so that they would become the same as the Midianites. First there was friendship, then temptation, and finally sin. If a man is standing by the side of the pit of sin, the evil spirits will never sleep. Given an opportunity, they will push man down the pit. The eating of the food offered to idols is something for the belly, and fornication is a sin against one's own body. Both cause the flesh to rejoice. The worldly associations, congregations, and lusts have led the Israelites and those in Pergamos into the pit of sin. Yet there is an unbroken line of followers behind the Israelites and those in Pergamos! Balaam has corrupted the Israelites of its distinction and has caused it to mingle itself with the nations and their idols. As such it is easy to understand its significance in type. Once the church is joined to the world, has received benefits from the world, and uses the world to attract fleshly men, the natural consequence is that the hired prophets will, for the protection of their own interest, do everything to corrupt the distinction of all the godly ones. This degradation is a corporate degradation. It has never been repented of; much less has the lost ground been recovered. Although throughout the ages there have been many individuals who have left this teaching, up to today the corporate recovery has not yet been seen. Every step downward increases the speed of the decline. "Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, and the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, whose name is The God of hosts" (Amos 5:25-27). Although since that time there have been many revivals and restorations, they have all been partial; there has never been a fresh start. Is the same not true for the church? Some have said that there is a new Pentecost now, but where is the new Pentecost? Did not even the first Pentecost last for only a brief period of time? "On you, the kindness of God, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off" (Rom. 11:22). Have the Gentiles continued in His kindness? Is it not rather the case that since the first day, the teaching of Balaam has become stronger and stronger and its disciples more and more numerous until the whole church is now conformed to this sinful teaching? No doubt the Israelites later moaned to remove the abominable things among them (Ezek. 9:4). But allow me to say a gentle word: is not the church still holding on to what the Lord condemns here? Although there is a minority who opposes this kind of influence, how many are there who can escape the sway of its power?</P><P>At the present time we should examine ourselves to see where we stand. Are we in "Babylon" or are we "outside the camp?" What have we done personally to separate the church from the world? Second Corinthians 6 strictly forbids believers from bearing the same yoke with unbelievers. Concerning this matter, have we fully "come out from their midst"? Before God, our keeping of companions will be judged in the same way our works will be judged. Although God wants to be our Father in experience, He cannot carry out His fatherly duty or manifest His fatherly love unless we come out from their midst. How numerous are the present number of congregations, denominations, and groups! Yet how many of God's children among these groups remember the solemn teaching in 2 Corinthians 6?</P><P>There are, of course, many reasons for God to forbid the bearing of various yokes. But the total significance of these yokes is an alliance with man for the purpose of pursuing after a common goal. Social ties, marital relationships, and partnerships in business are all examples of yokes. However, we must not forget that as far as yokes are concerned the most serious consideration is in relationship to the church itself. At present there are many methods of organization which are trying their best to mingle the church with the world. These methods have no trace of life but are rather formalities. A man can call himself a member of Christ and a child of God just by the ritual of baptism. The saved ones and the unsaved ones can equally come to the Lord's table to share in the Lord's supper. Under this kind of organization it is impossible to be separated from the world. The believers are in the church, and the world is also in the church. How can there be the separation? Charitable works, theological teachings, and all kinds of ecclesiastical ceremonies cannot make the many intruders and imposters in the church the children of God. Yet there are many who do not see what kind of yoke they are bearing in the church!</P><P>In some countries there are even state churches. Through one bill of parliament, a whole nation can become Christians. Some parents through their confession in Christianity make all their offspring Christians as well and their households Christian households. You can give a person a compromising title, yet this person is dead. Such a one becomes a performer and a hypocrite only because you have forced upon him the title of a Christian. You can hide his real condition from him, deceiving him and bribing him, yet in eternity he will wake up. But what a pity when such a one does wake up only to find himself in the midst of a boundless darkness! The reason for this is that you have borne the same yoke with him and have led him into deception and into the place of wailing and gnashing of teeth. If you would have made a separation earlier, you may have stirred up his conscience, and he may not have fallen into the condition that he is in.</P><P>It is unavoidable for the Judaistic churches to have a lot of mixture (cf. the section on Smyrna). There, no one has the solid assurance, and everyone is on probation, hoping to be saved. If the church is not composed of a group of saved ones, having only a method of salvation, it will be difficult to have the same yoke. According to the present prevailing thought, a man joins the church in hope of being saved. As such, it is hard to avoid seeing the church becoming an institution of saints and sinners combined. When man does not believe in the teaching of the assurance of salvation, such a condition is unavoidable.</P><P>Balaam was a hired prophet. He prophesied only for money. How numerous are the students of Balaam among today's churches! One argues that only with money can he build churches, buy Bibles, and support preachers. Yet Pentecost can never be purchased with money, and the millennium is never built on earth with money! Formerly, Balak hired Balaam to work. Now the church is seeking for the world to contribute money to pay for the preachers. Some worldly people have not even put on a Christian appearance, yet the church has already come to them for contributions. The church tells those who have not consecrated themselves to the Lord to consecrate their money! To them, as long as money is put to the right use, it does not matter by what method the money is secured. With money one can conduct charitable works and build schools and hospitals. With money one can buy Bibles and send preachers to evangelize the faraway lands. With money one can perform thousands of good works. "Why then should we worry where the money comes from? If the goal is right, why should we be worried about the means? Can one still hope to find miracles in the twentieth century?"</P><P>What can be the result of this plea for men to help the church and for the children of Satan to use their material riches to help a work that supposedly will destroy the work of Satan? Can we tell the world its true condition with a Bible that is printed with their money? Can we prove to them that before God everyone is a sinner and will perish? Can we tell them that they are the children of the devil? Can we tell them that no flesh can please God? If we want money from the world, then we must first change our gospel and auction our truth! The world does not have to give its money. It will certainly not give money to something that will be used to condemn itself. Once Balaam becomes our prophet, we cannot be too "square" anymore. At least, we have to be toned down a little and should be joined to the world. "Let the world come in, or else you cannot help it! There should be nice buildings, comfortable chairs, beautiful music, and soothing teachings. Since we cannot expect them to come up to our standard, we should lower ourselves to their level. How can we arouse their attention and gain their heart if there are no social gatherings, entertainment clubs, and other various colorful get-togethers?" Frankly speaking, if we want the world's help on the one hand, and try to preach the truth on the other hand, the world will turn around and say to us: "You have exhorted us to give money and to store up riches in heaven, yet you are telling us that we cannot go into heaven! What is this?" Readers, am I being too much? Is it not true that all faithful children of the Lord do have this kind of feeling? Actually, there is no word that can adequately describe the degradation of the works of the nominal Christians. I wish I could be like Jeremiah, with tears like a fountain, weeping day and night for those who are God's people in name! What a pity that day by day the church has sunken to a level below that of the world while boasting that the world has risen to her own level!</P><P>If we consider further the preaching work up until today, we have to admit that the teaching of Balaam has indeed gained many followers. Money is the power behind the preaching, and remuneration is the condition for work. The first question asked in the work is how much salary one will receive. If there is no money, the workers will go away. Those who pay more can expect a greater leader. Those poor villages that cannot afford much can never have a teacher. The rich church with a deep pocket has the biggest hope of getting the ones it admires. The poor church, in spite of its godliness and faith and riches before God, considers itself inferior to others and dares not invite those it admires. With money there is the power of choice. With little money there is no choice but to accept what is assigned. What man desires is a successful preacher. Of course, success here is measured with respect to the world. But then sometimes, God in His mercy will keep a church from having a Balaam to execute the teaching of Balaam. It is a fact that sometimes a godly preacher in a church rife with the teaching of Balaam will find himself restricted from doing anything. If he tries to do anything, he will be discharged. Godliness is not something that man likes, and as such it will never be welcomed by man. If the world desires godliness, it will not be the world anymore. Hence, there are few who remember to preach to the poor!</P><P>This is all I will say. If I say more, my heart will not be happy and will not improve anything. But I would present this most solemn matter before those who love Christ honestly and who honor Him faithfully. The teaching of Balaam is everywhere. What a shame this is to the Lord's name! If this is the only way to maintain the church and to support the preachers, why not let this work fall to pieces? If a Christian cannot go on without the world, he will soon find out that the world can go on without him! The Pharisees of old were wiser than the Christians of today. They said of the pieces of silver that "it is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is blood money" (Matt. 27:6). Because man does not believe in God's power and love, he devises many ways to fill up the lack. But if God truly does not have the power and the love, why do we have to spend the effort to do something in His name? If God is liable to fail, why do we not just allow Him to fail? If God can fail, what purpose is there for us to plan so much? If He cannot fail, does not planning expose our utter lack of faith? Where in the Bible does it record a campaign for money with organizational ways? Those who give should give "as a blessing and not as a matter of covetousness...each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver" (2 Cor. 9:5b, 7). God does not want an offering from sinners. What He wants is a willing consecration from His children.</P><P>Where can we find in the Bible the system of hired workers? It is true that "to the one who works" there is the reward (Rom 4:4) and that it is right that "those who announce the gospel...live from the gospel" (1 Cor. 9:14). But who is the one who hires the preacher? Whose servants are they? Are Christians offering money to hire preachers, or are they offering money to God? Are the preachers the workers of God or are they the workers of church members? God can certainly use His people to give money to His workers, but to the giver, it should not be a matter of remuneration to the preacher but a matter of offering to God. For the receiver, he should not consider the amount of work he does as the basis for the amount of money he should receive. Instead he should receive everything from God's hand. If the Lord's believers cannot give without using a certain method, will God then be short of their money? Why do we need their money anyway? If a servant of God cannot trust in the Lord fully, he should change to another profession and should earn an honest wage. The Bible does not give us one instance of a servant of God looking to man. When wages are stopped, the hired ones are gone. In this way, God's work will not be affected by money. This will prevent having useless ones among the servants of Christ. I have said before, and I will say it again, that if we cannot act by God's way, it is better that we not act at all. It is better to let the work fall than to use human inventions to replace the divine institutions. If one wants to offer, he has to do so willingly. If one wants to work, he has to trust in the Lord. Anything else will not please the Lord and should be rejected by those who faithfully love the Lord.</P><P>What is the result of the teaching of Balaam? First, it is idolatry, and second, it is fornication. At present, in addition to these actual sins, believers have many similar spiritual problems. In order to avoid being conspicuous, the believers have absorbed many heathen festivals and traditions and have christianized them. They utilize many heathen festivals as a time to give ground to the flesh. In the end, what we have is a mixed religion, with Christianity contributing the name and the idol worshippers contributing the teaching, the ceremonies, and the reality! Is the present church truly free from the power of idols? What is an idol? It is the setting up of something that man has made and worshipping it as god. Those who consider man's work as God are in reality worshipping idols. How much has the present church been freed from the realm of human work being taken as God? Where can a present believer show his distinction from the world? I do not mean a distinction from the Chinese customs. How many are there in the church who can completely reject festivals, traditions, and other idolatrous things? Or is there still the compromise, beautifying itself with a good name and utilizing this name? It is true that in many things the church is different from the Chinese customs, but can we say that it is different from the world? I am afraid that it is different from others, not because of the fact that it is Christian, but because of westernization! The god of this world is Satan. Those who follow the customs of this age are liable to idolatry in inclination and in fact. But we, the little ones, the ones who have believed in the Lord, should flee idolatry.</P><P>In the matter of fornication, is the church behind the Israelites? The Bible clearly considers the receiving of heresy as a kind of spiritual fornication. To befriend the world is also a kind of fornication. Although Christianity boasts of its power to integrate the worldly teachings, theories, and philosophies (what the Bible calls "the elements") and to turn them into the so-called western Christian culture, the Lord rebukes this as fornication! Christianity cares little for the loss of its standing, and in satisfying the appetite of the world overturns its own faith. The mind of the unregenerated man is very much lacking in standard and is full of darkness and error, yet this is what the so-called world culture is all about! The present so-called Christianity is not preaching Christ's death and resurrection but has instead become a totality of the worldly minds. As the tide of the age changes, unconsciously its position shifts gradually downstream. Periodically there are adjustments, but only for the purpose of making itself more compatible to the age. In fashioning its minds to become more modern, Christianity has drifted further away from its source! It is true that Christians are zealous, but for what reason? I am afraid it is for the reason of maintaining the name of their Christian denominations! As long as Christianity can exist in name, it is ready to sacrifice the existence of the fundamental teachings! But then, if Christianity is regressing, why not allow it to disappear, and why not set up a new religion? Why do we have to labor and be so busy stocking the goods only for the purpose of keeping such a shop running? It is a shocking fornication that the present church has committed in teaching. However, who considers this as being wrong?</P><P>Some things are clearly worldly and some people clearly love the world and make friends with the world. Yet all these are given the beautiful name of service and reform. God leaves His church in the world at this present age in order that it may be a witness to the world of the sin of crucifying His Son and of its impossibility for reform. God's only work is to save a group of people in the world and to gather them under His Son's name. When the church takes in the teaching of Balaam, she becomes a colony of the world! The present world no longer becomes simply a way for the church to pass through. Instead, it is developed as much as possible with the hope that it can eventually become the eternal home of the church! Thus, some have thought that the kingdom of heaven would be realized on earth through the church's work, and the church would remain on earth for millennia. Hence, education, labor, economy, politics, international relationships, and hundreds of other issues should all be studied and improved. However, while the church is busily engaged in all these activities, she has already lost her chastity completely! Through the introduction of the teaching of Balaam, the church has married the world. There is no lack of new terms invented by wise ones, but the Lord calls all these activities idolatry and fornication.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Fifteen</H2><P>Verse 15: "In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans."</P><P>After reading the Lord's letter to the Ephesians, we should realize what the works of the Nicolaitans are. Now we want to consider in detail the meaning of this word "Nicolaitans." At the beginning, there were only the works of the Nicolaitans, and the church in Ephesus was still opposed to this kind of works. However, now it is no longer a work but has become a teaching. Sinful works are done only in private. But when a new teaching is invented to support this kind of works, man becomes bold and open to commit those sins. The church in Pergamos was not as that in Ephesus, hating this kind of "works." On the contrary, she was holding this kind of "teaching."</P><P>Who were the Nicolaitans? Although many theories exist, some considering that there was such a person as Nicoli who was the originator of the evil teaching, all of these theories remain only theories. All writers throughout the ages have had much doubt concerning this matter. No one can prove that a man called Nicoli existed in history and no one can identify the sin of the doctrine he taught. But one thing we know: the Bible never tells us to read church history or to expound the Scripture with other histories. The word of God explains itself, and there is no need of outside help. Otherwise, only the wise and the knowledgeable would be able to understand God's word. The Scripture is revealed to babes. If it were not, only a few would need to study and to expound it, while the majority would only need to follow their decision. Hence, we should not care for what history says. Since the Lord Jesus mentioned this group of people twice, and we know that His word does not fail, the people of this group must be of much significance. According to the principle of all the other names of people and places recorded in Revelation 2 and 3, no name is without meaning. Thus there must be the Lord's intention in using this name.</P><P>The word "Nicolaitans" is composed of two words in the original language. The first word, "Nico," means to conquer and to subdue. The second word, "laitan," means the people or the common man. The two words are combined to form "Nicolaitans," which means those who conquer the people or those who subdue the common man. Hence, the Nicolaitans are none other than those who oppress, control, and subdue other brothers in the church because they are found in the church. The teaching of the Nicolaitans says that there should be hierarchy in the church and there should be a distinction between the rank of the clergy and the laity. As far as the meaning of the word goes, there is another significance which is very obvious: the Lord Jesus mentioned the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans together. Balaam is a Hebrew word, while Nicolaitans is a Greek word. We have seen that in Greek, the word "Nicolaitans" has the sense of subduing the people, but in Hebrew, the word "Balaam" also has a similar meaning. The word "Balaam" means "those who devour the people"! As Balaam taught Balak to induce the Israelites to join themselves to the world, the Nicolaitans in the same way turned the church organization into a worldly community.</P><P>We have covered the teaching of Balaam already. Now we want to concentrate on the teaching of the Nicolaitans. In the beginning, they were only engaged in the works of subduing others. This was not yet official and legal. Now this work has evolved into a teaching. There is a difference between "teaching" and "work." "Teaching" can be translated as "doctrine." Hence, these ones had made their work of a hierarchical distinction a doctrine in Christianity. With this teaching they made their acquired position fully legal. Now with such a doctrine that teaches a hierarchical distinction, they were able to protect their works. What we want to ask is how this happened between the time when there were only the works and when the teaching was there. In other words, for what reason was this work turned into a teaching? Why is it that in Ephesus there were only the works, but in Pergamos it had turned into a legal, acceptable doctrine? We have said something concerning this already. Between Ephesus and Pergamos there was the age of Smyrna. In the church in Smyrna, we saw the development of the Judaistic teaching. We have also pointed out what the Judaistic teaching was and how it had turned the church into a hierarchical organization. Hence, the work of the Nicolaitans in Ephesus, through the cultivation of the Judaistic teachings in Smyrna, became the teaching of the Nicolaitans in Pergamos.</P><P>We have seen that the Judaistic teachings are only a kind of measurement. They measure to see if man has achieved righteousness or not. While God is measuring man, man cannot draw near to God. The Judaistic teaching puts everybody under the same category. Hence, no one can be separated from the world. All those who were born of the flesh were able to join the Jewish religion.</P><P>Now we have to consider how this Judaistic teaching helped the teaching of the Nicolaitans. If the church becomes a Jewish "synagogue," then naturally Christians will become "Jews." The Jews were not able to draw near to God. Even the High Priest, who was a type of Christ, could only enter the Holy of Holies once. While he was in it, he still needed the incense to cover the mercy-seat in order for him not to perish. It was out of the question for the other priests. They could only enter the Holy Place; the Holy of Holies was forbidden to them. For the common citizens, even the Holy Place was unapproachable. Because of the Israelites' failure, they could not draw near to God. God's original intention was that the whole nation would be priests (Exo. 19:6). Yet they became fallen and broke the covenant. As a result, God established a family as priests, to take the place of a whole nation. From this we can see that the characteristic of Judaism is a separate and intermediate priesthood. God was in obscurity; man could not approach Him directly. As a result, God revealed Himself through a special group of people, and man approached God through this special group of people. Between the two, there was no direct fellowship. This is Judaism.</P><P>But how different is Christianity from Judaism! Christ has died, and the veil is rent. Everyone can now come directly to God. The intermediary priesthood has forever been removed, for now every believer is a priest before God. Through the accomplishment of Christ every Christian has unconditionally become a priest (Rev. 1:6; 1 Pet. 2:5). Now our sacrifices are spiritual ones. Our thanksgiving and praises and our life and body are all spiritual sacrifices (Heb. 13:15-16; Rom. 12:1). Our priestly work is to offer up these sacrifices. Hence, every one of us can contact God directly. Let me repeat: in Judaism man could not draw near to God. Even the priests did not really draw near to Him. The common people were even farther away than the priests. Wherever you have the hierarchy of the priesthood, there you will find the same situation of estrangement. The whole congregation never had the opportunity to come near. The meaning of a priestly class is to estrange God and lock Him in obscurity. The Nicolaitans were those who had a clerical position. These clergymen were a special group of people distinct from the laity. They were the specialists in the holy things. They had special privileges and authorities in the divine things. They were a spiritual class, a special group of people who had the special right to lead others in spiritual things. They seemed to be closer to God than others, not through their distinctive spiritual power but through their position being above that of an ordinary believer. Under them were many common believers, whose position could never rival that of the clergy. The former were but common worldly ones who were like the Israelites of old, being in their position far away from God. Although the cross had drawn them close to God, the system of the Nicolaitans had annulled the function of the cross and had isolated God's children. The system of "priests" in the Roman Catholic Church and the system of "pastors" in the Protestant churches are but different manifestations of the teaching of the Nicolaitans. The pastoral system was actually an altered expression of the priestly system. If we admit the existence of the clerical class and deem that they should enjoy far more power and privileges than the common believers, when all the while the Scriptures never promise or ordain such, we are subscribing to nothing less than the teaching of the Nicolaitans! The center of the doctrine of the Nicolaitans is to have the common believers under the hand of a special group of people. The Nicolaitans are the ones who subdue the people! Where in the Bible does it say that Christians should obey a group of people with a special ministry? Surely there is none. Based on the New Testament, we can say that this matter was invented later by others. They only borrowed the Judaistic terms and used them for their own purposes. All those who take the Bible as the supreme law court should receive this light.</P><P>But where is the present day teaching of the Nicolaitans? The priests of the Roman Catholic Church naturally think that they are the priests of God. They stand between God and man and carry out ministries similar to those of the priests in the Old Testament. I am afraid many Protestants will think that their present pastors do not have as much priestly authority as the priests in the Roman Catholic Church. They are surely not wrong. We do not wish to engage in debates here. But for the sake of the churches' benefit in China, we can make one more observation which will help us to understand the situation and to realize whether or not our present system of pastors is in the nature of a priest that stands between God and man. What is a priest? A priest is one who comes to God on behalf of man. A priest is man's representative before God. He is one who stands between God and man, offering man's sacrifice for God and bringing it to God.</P><P>Praise and thanksgiving are the "spiritual sacrifices" that we the Christians as priests offer to God. If we set up another group of special people who officially and regularly offer the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving on behalf of all other Christians, then indeed we have an intermediary priesthood! These ones then become the mediators, for they become a special class of people who are closer to God positionally than other ordinary believers.</P><P>The Lord's supper is the highest expression of the Christian thanksgiving and worship. Do not many present Protestant pastors hold the administering of the Lord's supper as their exclusive and official right? Is it not true that so many common believers and even unordained preachers are afraid of administering the Lord's supper, thinking that to do so would be sacrilegious? This is the error caused by man's tradition and organization. They consider that except for the pastors, all Christians are but worldly people and are not worthy to execute the things of God. The professions of the common believers are in the world. Of course, they cannot be as spiritual as the clergy. For this reason, they should not touch the spiritual things. They can therefore be discharged from their spiritual responsibilities and can hand over all spiritual affairs to those who specialize in this work. However, the matter does not stop here. "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge" (Mal. 2:7). Since the ordinary believers have given up their priesthood, they naturally cannot retain their priestly knowledge. They consider themselves unworthy of taking care of the spiritual matters. As such, sooner or later they will lose their spiritual knowledge. At that time the special group of people will become the only ones who have the right to expound the Bible. They would argue that worldly ones are never able to know the Bible as well as the clergy. In this way, the clergy becomes the ears, the eyes, and the mouth of the common believers. Later, they go on further and replace the whole body of the believers!</P><P>This clerical group not only considers itself to have the special right to spiritual things and the exclusive power to administer the Lord's supper, but also considers itself to be the only group of people who can baptize others. However, there is no such teaching in the Bible. We have mentioned this in previous places already.</P><P>But why is the teaching of the Nicolaitans as prevalent in the church now as it was in the past? Why are the clerical ones so bold to uplift themselves, and why do the common believers think that they are different from the clergy? The biggest reason lies in the ritual of ordination. The clergymen think that they have been ordained and as such, they have the right to do something that ordinary believers cannot do. The common believers, on the other hand, consider that they have never been ordained and that too many things are too spiritual and holy for them to participate in.</P><P>Therefore, we have to spend some time to investigate, not from the church but from the Bible, the matter of ordination. If we read through the New Testament, we will not be able to find one place where man must be ordained before he can teach, preach, administer the Lord's supper, or baptize others. At the beginning, we see the church in Jerusalem being dispersed and everyone except the apostles going out to preach. They were not ordained to do that work. At least, the persecution was not an ordination to them! Apollos and Philip were two examples. Timothy received the gift of prophecy through the laying on of the hands of Paul and the elders. That laying on of hands was for the gift and not for the authority to exercise the gift. Paul committed his knowledge to the faithful ones, who would teach others with it. But nothing was mentioned there about ordination. Many people like to quote the case of Saul and Barnabas in Antioch as a Scriptural basis for receiving authority through ordination, but if we read this passage carefully (Acts 13:1-4), we will see that this passage cannot serve as proof of it. On the contrary, it breaks down the doctrine of ordination of believers for special authority. First, let me ask, "Did Barnabas and Saul preach only after this "ordination," or had they done this long before already?" If we try to give a fair answer, we will see the true value of ordination. Second, who ordained Saul and Barnabas? Could the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch ordain apostles? God has placed in the church "first apostles, second prophets, third teachers" (1 Cor. 12:28). Can the second and the third ordain the first? Those who believe in the authority of ordination should awake to this fact. Therefore what is mentioned here is nothing but a special commission of the Holy Spirit for Barnabas and Saul to do the work that the Holy Spirit had called them to do, that of itinerant preaching. The fact that the church in Antioch laid its hand on them was only a demonstration of their oneness and sympathy with them.</P><P>What then is the meaning of ordination? If ordination is insignificant, then those who believe in the authority of ordination would not have argued so much for it. Strictly speaking, there are two sides to the matter of ordination. These two aspects are the most common and popular notions of ordination. First, the Roman Catholics and those who are superstitious about formalities think that ordination gives a person not only authority but spiritual power as well. They consider that they have the apostolic power, and therefore they can give to others the Holy Spirit through their laying on of hands. Their priests, or fathers, are produced through this process of ordination, and as such, are different from ordinary believers. Hence, no other people of God can participate in their priesthood. This special group of people then insert themselves between God and man, serving as priests and praying on behalf of the people. The church is then seen as the outlet of all graces, and the accomplishment of Christ on the cross naturally recedes to the background.</P><P>Second, in Protestantism, seemingly there is no such sin, and seemingly there is no need for us to belabor this point. Yet Protestantism also has its view concerning ordination. It does not recognize the unreasonable demand of the Roman Catholic Church. Neither does it consider it a means for the ordained one to receive the gift at the time of ordination. Yet it considers the meaning of ordination as nothing other than an acknowledgement of the ordained ones being endowed with the gift of God. Without such an acknowledgement, a person cannot and should not baptize others or administer the bread to others. Here we must ask a question: what gift does a person use to baptize others or to administer the Lord's supper? As to preaching, if a man has the gift of God already, why does he have to be acknowledged by man? Moreover, it is assumed that the acknowledging ones have the discernment and the ability, while other common believers do not have this discernment and ability, and for that reason, they exercise their ability on behalf of the whole and acknowledge these gifted ones on their behalf!</P><P>This way of doing things is most unfaithful before God. If He has given me a gift, I have to exercise it. If God has given me a gift, but I have to go to man or before a congregation for acknowledgement and approval before I can exercise it, is this not offensive to the Lord? The Lord gives us a gift because He reckons that we are worthy of exercising it. If that is the case, why do we have to be acknowledged by man? But then, some say that man can be wrong. They say that sometimes a man thinks that he has the gift, but he is wrong and that in reality he has not received the gift. For this reason, there must be the acknowledgement from man. It is true that man can be wrong, but is it not true that those who acknowledge others can also be wrong? If this is the case, who can we trust? If a man is wrong, it is of course serious, but if a group who acknowledges a person is wrong, how much more serious is this? If an individual whom God has not sent is mistaken, he can still turn back. But if you have ordained him and have consecrated him forever, is not such a failure more serious? If he is not capable of being a pastor, yet has been ordained to be one, what shall he do now that he has become one? Whether or not his ordainer is wrong, he is at any rate ordained and has become a clergyman and should therefore be assigned a field for his work. Even if he is useless, he must be assigned at least a very small place. But then, even the believers in the small places are God's children. Why should they starve under such a one's hand? The one who has ordained such a one in the first place should bear the responsibility for this matter.</P><P>Such an ordained pastor at least must take up three responsibilities in a church: as a teacher, as an evangelist, and as a shepherd. We know that a person does not necessarily have all three kinds of gifts. The worst cases may not even have any one of these three gifts. Those who have one gift are considered good already. We cannot expect a person to have all the gifts. Throughout history there have been few who possessed all three kinds of gifts. If one is an evangelist, he has to lead many to repentance and to believe in the Lord. But because he is not a teacher, these saved ones cannot be edified. Or perhaps one is a teacher and not an evangelist. As such, he cannot lead others to the Lord, and the church that he is managing will either have many empty seats or will be filled with nominal believers. If he is a shepherd, he will be capable of caring for the sheep and of visiting his church members. Yet he is neither an evangelist nor a teacher. As such many nominal believers will remain forever nominal and will not know salvation nor be edified to grow spiritually. This kind of work where one is ordained to manage a whole congregation and where the whole congregation, whether it be thirty people or three hundred people, is assigned to the hands of one person alone as the "flock" under him, with no one else who can interfere or have any say in the matter, is the result of the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</P><P>Please do not misunderstand the teaching of the Bible. Although the Bible has never taught us that a man must be ordained before he can preach and teach and before he can administer the bread or baptize others, it has never annulled the works that Christians have been set apart to do. The work of preaching is established by God. This is a distinctive feature of the church. It does not mean that since the Bible has no record of any ordination that leads to a clerical class that transcends over other brothers, there is, therefore, no such thing as the ministry of preaching in the Bible. Actually, the Bible, on the one hand, opposes the establishment of a hierarchy in the Lord's church and the division into the ordained and the unordained ones. Yet on the other hand, the Bible strongly upholds the importance of the work of preaching. It is true that all Christians should be witnesses, but the Bible clearly tells us that there is a group of people who are set apart especially for this work. God gives the gift of preaching to some and not to all. Yet the purpose of this giving is for all. No one who truly understands God's word can say that every Christian is an evangelist, a shepherd, or a teacher. There is only a minority among all Christians who can do these works. The Bible regards the work of preaching to be more important than man regards it today. The Bible teaches us that everyone who preaches for the Lord does so by receiving the gift from the Head of the church, who takes care of His people under His direction. These workers receive their ministry from God and are responsible to God and God alone. However, the present organizational way as practiced by many serves only to make a person the servant of man. God's honored servants have been greatly despised by His people! Although on the one hand, these servants have been placed on a high pedestal and have been assigned the oversight of a congregation or a chapel, they, on the other hand, have been bound from acting according to the Bible and must instead follow man's tradition and organization and must deal with man with an "artificial" conscience, while coming short in their own conscience towards God! Under such circumstances it seems that for a servant of God to be faithful to man's tradition, organization, and definition is equivalent to being faithful to the Lord!</P><P>The work of preaching that I am talking about is the work of evangelizing, teaching, or shepherding done by those who are working exclusively for the Lord. According to the Bible, this kind of preaching work is very ordinary. The church of God is the Body of Christ. In the Body, every member is a member of Christ. Other than this, the Bible does not know of any "church membership." There is only one Body of Christ; it is not many bodies. In the same way, there is only one church and not many churches. Everyone belongs to this unique church. We are not constituents of a sect or members of a denomination. Other than being members of this Body, we have no other title of membership or affiliation. As members, we belong to Christ. Those who do not belong to Christ are not His members. The church is composed of all the individual members together. All those who are not the members of the Lord do not belong to the church. All titles of membership and affiliation are vain and worthless and are invented by man. The Bible is only concerned with the question of being a member or not being a member. Since every individual is a member, and since the members do not have independent works, no two works of any two individuals can be the same. It is impossible for everyone to be the ear or to be the eye. Rather, everyone should serve one another and help one another. In addition to being faithful in one's own work and helping those members who are related to him, every member must also work for the benefit of the whole Body.</P><P>The apostle taught us clearly that every member has its gift. "For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us..." (Rom. 12:4-6). Following this Paul mentioned the functions of many gifts. In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul mentioned these gifts again. He said that these gifts are the "manifestation of the Spirit" (v. 7). Hence, a person who has a gift is a person who has in him the manifestation of the Holy Spirit for the profit of others. If he has the gift, he should exercise it and should be responsible to the Lord for it. The Lord does not give gifts to man in vain. When one has the gift, he has to do the work of preaching and has the authority to do such a work. What I have, I should use for the benefit of others. If others receive my help, they do not need to ask if I have been commissioned to do such a work.</P><P>This is the nature of the work of preaching as taught by the Bible. It is very simple and straightforward. Each individual member serves the other through love and by the power received from God for the benefit of all and for the building of the whole Body, without ostracizing anyone or cutting off anyone. All the gifts are put into the same common bank, and everyone becomes richer from these deposits. The manifestation of the Holy Spirit and the blessing of the Lord is God's mark of approval. Given these things, there is no need for any suggestion from fleshly opinions. Although not everyone is a teacher and not everyone can teach the word of God before others, those who are the teachers are but members of the whole Body. Their works are to teach the Bible and to edify others with God's word. In all other things, they still have to receive the help and edification of the other members. Everyone is useful, and everyone is a member. If we disproportionately uplift the gift of the teachers, the evangelists, or the shepherds and regard their works as the whole work, or if we exalt those works done in public more than those services done in private, we do not understand the function of the Body of Christ in the church of God. There may be a difference in importance among the different works and gifts, but we must know that everyone has his realm, and that despite the difference in importance, no one can take over another's work, and no one can say that the less weighty ones are the useless ones.</P><P>Other than the above groups of people, is there no other group? Is there no one else who is ordained? Is that all there is, or should there be others who are ordained? Here we are on a completely different question, one that is separate and isolated from the previous one. It is true that in the ancient church, there were two kinds of officers commissioned (or ordained) to their specific tasks. One was the deacons. The deacons were the ones who managed the fund for helping the poor. They were selected by the saints and were ordained, or commissioned, by the authority of the apostles. The second kind was the elders. As the name implies, they were naturally the ones who were mature both in age and in virtue. They were the ones who served as "overseers" in the separate churches, overseeing the condition of the people. If we read Titus 1:5, 7 and Acts 20:17, 28, we will realize that the elders are the overseers. The term "elder" refers to the person, and the term "overseer" refers to the work.</P><P>The work they did was the work of overseeing. Since heresies and evil teachings were prevalent at that time, being "apt to teach" must have been one of their qualifications (1 Tim. 3:2). However, we must not make the mistake in thinking that since elders should be apt to teach, all therefore who teach are the elders. We must not think that since the elders are ordained, or appointed, that therefore everyone who teaches should be ordained. If we have this thought, we are most definitely wrong. First, an elder does not teach because he has become an elder. Rather, he is one who is apt to teach first, then afterwards is ordained an elder. As such, is it not clear that before his ordination, he was teaching others already? Second, in the books to Timothy, the apostle clearly separated the elders from those who teach: "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching" (1 Tim. 5:17). Hence, an elder is one who manages a church. He can manage a church well without being a teaching one.</P><P>From the above we can see that the Bible does not warrant such things as a church ordaining someone to do the work of preaching and teaching. This latter practice is but a different form of the Roman Catholic priesthood. Such a human invention and tradition is not found in the Bible. However, some zealous religionists think that believers should honor all the systems of the church and that although the Scripture contains no such teaching, we should abide by such decisions of the church. What kind of doctrine is this? Does this not carry the tone of Roman Catholicism with it? The overriding principle in Roman Catholicism is that authority rests with the church and that even the Bible has to be interpreted according to the mandate of the church. It does not allow believers to read the Bible and requires that man obey the church more than he obeys the Bible. As Protestants, are we not opposed to this principle? Does not the principle of Protestantism state that apart from the Bible the church has no authority? Is not our principle that of complete obedience to the Bible and not to the church? If we recognize the existence of the authority of the church, are we not going back to Roman Catholicism? The Son of God told us Himself that we need not keep man's tradition. He said of those who were keen to abide by the tradition of their ancestors that "this people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me; but in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men" (Matt. 15:8-9). If we want to abide by man's tradition, we are transgressing the commandment of God (v. 3).</P><P>Since we cannot find in the Bible the teaching of ordination for the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers, we know that the system of the denominations is a tradition of man and is of no effect to those Christians who faithfully love the Lord. However, many have often argued that elders and deacons were still ordained in the church. This being the case, can we not ordain pastors according to the principle that the elders were ordained in the old days? Concerning this matter, allow me to speak a frank word. Do those who speak these words know what kind of qualifications there are for an elder? Here is a person who is not yet married and who is still young in age. He has recently received a diploma from a Bible school and has worked for only a few years. Now he is ordained as a pastor. One says that this is according to the biblical principle of the ordination of the elders. Does this not surprise one who knows the Bible well? Can such a person be an elder?</P><P>We have said that elders are for managing a church. Shepherding, however, is a gift (Eph. 4:11). We have also mentioned that the exercise of a gift does not require man's acknowledgement and ordination. Hence, the above reason cannot be considered as a proper reason. Bible scholars have long ago pointed out that in the Bible no individual church has only one elder. Every time the Bible mentions the elders of individual churches or what we call now the congregation, it is always plural in number. If we consider the present pastors as the elders, in addition to confusing officers with gifts, we are changing the number of elders in a church from plural to singular! The churches in the Bible had many elders, yet the present churches have only one pastor for a church. If we recognize the ordination invented by the Nicolaitans, we will have to do what practically cannot be done. Bible scholars have already told us that the elders and deacons in the Bible were ordained, or more correctly put, commissioned, by either the apostles themselves or those charged by the apostles or who came in the authority of the apostles. If we are to ordain the elders and the deacons today, we must first ask, where are the present-day apostles? Where are those who have a direct charge from the apostles or who have received the authority of the apostles, like Titus and Timothy did? Hence, those who want to ordain others must first prove their own qualifications. If you are not an apostle and you do not have the charge or the authority from the apostles, you have no right to ordain others. Those who are ordained should ask if the one who ordains them is an apostle or not. If he is not, such ordination is a vain ordination! All those who believe in the Bible recognize the fact that there are no longer any apostles. As such, does it not mean that there is now no more ordination? We admit that in the present churches (not the denominations) there are those who are doing the work which the elders and deacons in the ancient time used to do, but we do not recognize anyone as being officially ordained as an elder or a deacon. We have mentioned this matter before. Here we do not need to repeat it again.</P><P>However, we have to know that the teaching of the Nicolaitans does not involve only a group of people uplifting themselves to a special position. We have to realize that this is something that the common believers prefer. If the ordinary believers object to this and consider this a loss of their right and a demotion of their qualification, such unscriptural and damaging hierarchical distinction between the clergy and the laity would not have prevailed as it has. It is because the ordinary believers love this that the teaching of the Nicolaitans was allowed to prevail. The laity is grateful to the clergy because these professional ones are willing to replace the nonprofessional ones to bear the responsibility of all spiritual things. Since believers have lost their first love, they have long ago lost their taste for spiritual things. As such they are more than willing for someone to come and take over everything. By calling themselves the laity, they consider themselves just the ordinary believers, which means that they cannot be blamed for being worldly! The world should not expect them to be too spiritual! God's foreordained words were not only fulfilled in the Israelites but are also realized in the church today: "The prophets prophesy falsely, / And the priests rule by their own authority; / And My people love it this way" (Jer. 5:31).</P><P>How we wish that we did not have to speak what we are speaking here! How we wish that the scattered children of God could walk according to His word and could move solely by God's instruction without any tradition or self-will. If this were the case, we would not have need to say all the things that we have said! But since we are at a time of apostasy and tradition, we, the servants of God, dare not be silent, and we dare not keep back our testimony against sin, whether it be sin in the world or sin in the church.</P><P>The Lord Jesus said in Revelation 2:6, "But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate." In the original language, the last clause can be translated as "which things I also hate." Brothers, please be assured that what we are speaking here is not aimed at certain persons. We are not speaking about a specific person. If this is the case, may God save us from the sin of criticizing His children! We are like the Lord, addressing only the things themselves. He said, "Which things I also hate." He did not say, "These persons I also hate." We dare not speak, act, or have any motive beyond what the Bible has recorded. What we do not want and what saddens our hearts the most is to often find at the end of this age of apostasy that we are living in an environment where man teaches as teachings the commandments of men (Matt. 15:9) and accepts the "tradition of the elders" (v. 2) without searching into them. These traditions, moreover, are related to the former spiritual giants whom we love and honor. We admit that in many denominations there are many true servants of God; their names always invoke our respect. May God be gracious to us if we have the intention to speak concerning them!</P><P>However, here lies our very danger. Those whom we respect, whether past or present, are in the denominations and have received the teaching of the Nicolaitans. We think that the things that have been passed on through their hands to us, being the "tradition of the elders," should not be wrong. As a result, we do not compare them with the word of God in His light and do not differentiate and examine carefully to see if what we have received and what is declared are contrary to the teaching of God. Although we respect many servants of God in the denominations, we must be careful! We should not neglect the authority of the Bible through our respect for them. We respect Luther. We respect John Wesley, Calvin, and thousands of other servants of God. Yet we must know that the standard of our faith and walk is "thus saith Jehovah" rather than "thus saith Luther, Wesley, or Calvin" or many other names less prominent than these. It is right to respect and honor them, but we must not become extreme in doing this. Otherwise, we will fall into danger.</P><P>Some may think that the question of the church is not important and that there is no great difference between one system and another, that all are right. We have nothing to say concerning this remark. However, there is one thing that we have to know, that is, our Lord can never be wrong. His attitude toward everything should be the attitude of every Christian. He said, "Which things I also hate." He has a reason for this, and He cannot be wrong. All those who fellowship with the Lord, who know the Lord's heart, and who are willing to be obedient to Him should sympathize with Him and should hate what He hates. No matter what others may say, and no matter how spiritual and good they are, if we stand on the Lord's ground, we are safe. We should not be afraid of trouble, nor should we be shy. We should rather take the same attitude that the Lord has. If we do not sympathize with the Lord, we cannot have the same kind of declaration as the Lord has. He said that He hates the works of the Nicolaitans. How many are there who hate together with Him?</P><P>Let us come back to our subject. The Lord said, "In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans." We should pay particular attention to the words "in like manner." The last verse mentions "the teaching of Balaam." This verse mentions "the teaching of the Nicolaitans." What the Lord means here is that in the church in Pergamos, as there were those who held the teaching of Balaam, in the same way there were those who held the teaching of the Nicolaitans. The teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans are twin sisters. When one comes, the other is also there. The essence of the teaching of Balaam is to work for money and to seduce the people of God to join the world, to worship idols, and to commit fornication. The essence of the teaching of the Nicolaitans is to monopolize all spiritual matters and to create hierarchies in the church. We have seen how the present churches have been fully fermented by these two teachings. In the church there are hierarchies, and all the spiritual things and things related to worship are monopolized by the clergymen. On the other hand, hired workers fill the church. Under the direction of their work, they attempt to break down all barriers between the church and the world and to join the two together, having the same appearance in the world and taking the same stand in things regarding the world. They adopt the worldly festivals and other ceremonies and ordinances and commit the sin of idolatry before God. Furthermore, they join themselves to the worldly philosophies, schools, and doctrines, giving them a biblical name, while propagating worldly wisdom and committing fornication before God. As a result, the Lord has the following words of warning:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Sixteen</H2><P>Verse 16: "Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth."</P><P>The Lord demanded His messengers to repent and to drive the sinning ones from their midst. The Lord considers the messengers the ones responsible before Him. When men follow the teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans, the Lord holds the messengers responsible. The Lord rebuked the messengers because He considers them the representatives of the church. The Lord considers it their responsibility to excommunicate from the church those who follow the teaching of Balaam and the Nicolaitans. To excommunicate those who believe in heresy does not mean to drive away the unbelievers from the midst of the believers. It means to drive out those Christians who have erred in conduct and in doctrine. The Lord has to preserve the purity of the church. If the church will not execute punishment, the whole body of the church will be damaged by errors. The Lord wants His children to be firm and pure in conduct and in doctrine. If this cannot be maintained, the sinning ones should be excommunicated for the sake of protecting the other children of God. A heresy or a sinful act must be punished, even if it is committed by a saved Christian. Otherwise, this heresy or evil will become the leaven that ferments the whole lump. For the sake of the purity of the church, and in order to prevent other believers from being deceived, it is indispensable for the church to punish the sinning Christians. Moreover, this punishment is beneficial also to the excommunicated believers, for when the church exercises righteousness and love to remove the sinning ones from the church according to the teaching of the Bible and the leading of the Holy Spirit, the sinning ones will be recovered to their true faith and will repent of their sinful acts through the punishment. If this is not done, the condition will worsen and there will be no chance for turning back. Hence, excommunication either leads one to turn back or preserves the purity of the whole. In either case, it is beneficial. It is beneficial not only from man's point of view, but it is a necessary removal from God's point of view. Apart from doing this, there is no way to maintain the Lord's honor and holiness. The Lord is in the midst of the churches. His person and attributes must be honored. If any man in the church follows sin or heresy, he is despising and damaging the person and attributes of the Lord. The church in Pergamos did not execute judgment according to the Lord's intention. As a result the Lord called them to repentance. Often believers do not remove sinful ones from among their midst because of natural affections, fear of troubles, considerations, indifference, and apathy. The Lord's way is to wait patiently and to stir up the conscience of the believers by suitable means so that they will become zealous for the Lord Himself and for His house. If they continue to remain cold, He will then come to judge the sins that the church cannot judge. If believers would remember that the house of God should be pure and that God Himself is a consuming fire, they will know how to preserve the order in the house of God and will not come into conflict with God's holiness.</P><P>What are the limits of the excommunication of believers? These are covered clearly in the Bible. First, there must be obvious sins. Naturally, it is unavoidable for believers to become weak or to fail, and sometimes they are liable to sin. However, these are not the basis of excommunication. A believer should be excommunicated only on the ground of obvious immorality. We can see this clearly from 1 Corinthians 5.</P><P>Second, there must be heresies involved. We know that even the best believers may have differences in biblical exposition and doctrinal views. What then are the heresies? The Bible allows believers to have freedom of opinions. In many things man has the freedom to be led directly by the Lord. Many particular views should be tolerated with forbearance and love by Christians. We can see this clearly from Romans 14 and 15. However, those who do not believe in the Lord Jesus coming in the flesh and other fundamental doctrines concerning the person of the Lord Jesus should be excommunicated. First John 4 and 2 John 6-7 along with other places have covered the matter clearly. Hence, in order for the church to excommunicate a person, he must have obvious immoral sins or must be one who denies the fundamental doctrines.</P><P>The Lord did not consider the whole church as having failed. He only considered this sin to be local and not global. The whole church must surely bear the responsibility. However, judgment will only come to the sinning ones. "I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth." It is not to war with you. Although sin can grow and can corrupt the whole church, the Lord considers His faithful people as a remnant. When the Lord comes, His people will either rejoice or be sorrowful. The reason for this is that there are differences among them in faith and work. The Lord Jesus has the authority to judge all those who have sinned.</P><P>"I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth." The Lord's sword is not in vain. Here He is telling us that He Himself is judging His own servants with the power of God's judging word. We have mentioned that the spiritual significance of the sword is the word of God. If believers despise God's word of teaching, warning, and correction, the same word will in that day judge and punish the believers through the power of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Seventeen</H2><P>Verse 17: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</P><P>Here the Lord Jesus is again calling those who have spiritual ears to learn the lesson taught by the Holy Spirit. "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knows except he who receives it."</P><P>We should pay special attention to the Lord's promise to the overcomers in Pergamos. We have seen that the condition in Pergamos is not merely an ancient event but the current condition. Not only are the teachings and warnings of this letter related to us, even its promises directly affect us. Actually, it should affect us more today than in those days because we are living in the age when the sinful teachings of those days are ripening, maturing, and increasing.</P><P>Although the condition of the church as revealed in this letter is most corrupt and gloomy, the promise it contains is full of life and light. When circumstances are particularly trying, the overcomers will have particular rewards. According to the preordained course, if we want to gain our possession, we must pass through sufferings, trials, and battles. The Lord's word here is for the comfort and encouragement of those who are still on the way. But the distant view unfolded in these words seems to take one beyond the battlefield into the possession of one's hope already! This promise is divided into two parts. First is the manna, which typifies Christ. It shows how the believers long after Christ. Second is the white stone, which typifies the Christian. It shows how the Lord longs after the Christian. This exchange of love is most touching! All those who trust in the Lord, who honor His name and would not deny this name, will be rewarded according to their faithfulness.</P><P>Before we go on to the spiritual significance, we first have to mention one important point. We have to realize that this promise was meant to be literal. Although there are spiritual meanings to the Lord's promises, we should not consider the spiritual significance first and ignore the literal facts. In the interpretation of God's word, we should know that other than the parables, the prophetic symbols, and the signs, everything should be expounded literally. However, this does not mean that we should annul all spiritual meanings. We should not annul the literal meanings by the spiritual meanings. One should first expound literally, then spiritually. By this, the word of God will be made rich. As to the first half of this promise, we know that there were people who had eaten manna before. Hence, it is not impossible for man to eat manna again in the future. In the future, we will have a resurrected body. We will be like the Lord Jesus, being able to eat and drink as before. The manna was the people's food in the wilderness. Yet the hidden manna promised by the Lord is not for every believer but for the overcoming ones among all the believers. Let us consider the second half of the promise. What is the white stone? We know that the manna and the white stone are both objects taken from the Aaronic priesthood. As Pharaoh of old gave Joseph a new name and a ring, in the same way Christ will give to His overcomers a new name and a white stone. This name is now kept secret. Only the overcomers will know the secret of this heavenly name, and only the overcomers will inherit this name. As the name of Antipas was unknown to man, in the same way, the name of the overcomers will be unknown to the world.</P><P>We believe that in the future there will be literal manna to feed our resurrected bodies. We also believe that in the future we will receive an actual precious white stone. This is the literal side of these words. However, besides the literal meanings, there are still many profound spiritual meanings. Now we want to consider the spiritual side of these words.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Hidden Manna</H2><P>Let us first look at the hidden manna. Manna is the food in the wilderness. It was not found in Egypt, and it ceased to come after the entry into Canaan. It was only sent down in the wilderness. Manna is not something common. It is God's food to those who trust in Him solely, who have no other trusts, whose only support is from God, and who would die of starvation otherwise. It is because men have this dependence and need that God manifests His power and love to take up the responsibility to meet their needs.</P><P>There are those in the church who love the world. When they think of Egypt, they think of the land as being rich and filled with tasty food. They consider what the world can give to be better than what the Lord can give. "We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic; but now our soul is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna before our eyes" (Num. 11:5-6). Manna was given to those in the wilderness. Those whose bodies were in the wilderness but whose hearts were in Egypt did not consider the manna as being precious. On the contrary, they longed after the tasty food of Egypt. Those believers whose bodies were in the church in Pergamos but whose hearts were in the world would surely find the teaching of Balaam and his offerings most palatable. But those overcomers in Pergamos whose bodies and hearts were in the church knew that what they were passing through was merely the wilderness. As such, they were willing only to eat of the wilderness food, manna. The believers in Pergamos ate idol sacrifices, yet the Lord gave the overcomers there the manna. What a sharp contrast this is!</P><P>Of course, this manna refers to the Lord Jesus Christ. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus clearly refers to Himself as the One typified by the manna. Yet what is mentioned here is not just the manna but the "hidden manna." This hidden manna was what God had commanded Moses to put within the ark so that the Israelites would remember the food they ate in the wilderness when they entered Canaan. Naturally, this hidden manna was not eaten by the Israelites. Yet the Lord promised to give us this manna. It became possible for the overcoming believers to eat what the Israelites were not able to eat. All those who reject the reward in this age will eat of the future manna. Although we may lose the nice foods of this age, we will eat of the food of the eagle and will enjoy what the Lord will give to us at the table of the marriage feast of the Lamb. Although we miss the offerings of the kings in this age, we will be fed by our Melchisedec and will receive power from Him.</P><P>Manna typifies the Lord Jesus coming down from heaven and joining Himself to the life of the wilderness and taking a humble position. God would have the believers who are beaten in the world to remember the position of Christ here. The "hidden manna" speaks of the manna being hidden in the ark. This kind of manna was placed within the Holy of Holies and remained there as a memorial before God. This is a type of Christ, who came down to the world, and who became the portion God reserved for His people. This reminds us of the Christ who was once in the wilderness but who since then and forever remains in heaven. This hidden manna speaks of how the Christ who was here and who is now in glory has become the heavenly food. The hidden manna is not the daily manna. Rather, it is the manna that testifies daily in the land of Canaan. What a wonderful thing it is for the heavenly grace to be joined to the wilderness living! What is in the golden pot in the ark is a reminder of the life who left heaven to sympathize with those on earth. Hence, the hidden manna is a type of the ascended Christ. However, this Christ is the same One who came and lived on earth. Although He is today at the right hand of God, we still remember how He was tried and rebuffed in the world. At present, we are also in the wilderness and are beset with many special trials. If we remember how the Christ who was with us in the wilderness was tried in all things just as we are tried, and if we take this Christ as our food, we will have the strength to go on. Although at present He cannot be seen by man's eyes, He is the food of His faithful people. We must not only share with Christ in His heavenly glory, but we must also share with Him in His fellowship on earth. Although He is hidden, He is still the manna. Eventually, we will enter into heaven to enjoy all the peace and joy and will share the glory with the Lord Jesus. It is He who will give us the glory, yet it is also He who suffered and who was rejected on earth. When we think of this, do not our hearts rejoice? We abide here with Him, suffering the same kind of treatment as He suffered, but having Him as our portion. Our only regret is that we can only feebly suffer here one thousandth of a percent of what He suffered!</P><P>At the present time of apostasy and tradition, God is giving to the overcomers that which is hidden in Him. Such a promise causes every faithful one of God to leave the present, outward, and public work and come to the hidden place in the Holy of Holies. The church has been joined to the world. It has already been lifted up to a high place and is admired by all in the world! Within the church, there is already the presence of sinful works and erroneous teachings! Those who want to exalt themselves naturally find it hard to part with the church and the world, but those who faithfully serve God receive the hidden manna. Is there such a thing in the world as glorious manna? Since the manna is hidden, it cannot be for those who exalt themselves and who desire to be admired in the church or in the world. If we want to grow in the spiritual life, to fellowship with God, and to gain His Son's heart, we cannot be joined to the sinful world and the apostate church. To drift with the evil tide surely requires no spiritual effort. Both the church and the world will allow one to be on the surface of the water and to be seen by all. Yet the pitiful thing is that they would take the same one to a place that he ought not to go! The hidden manna is surely hidden from the eyes of most people. The heart of an exalted one can never be compatible with the hidden manna. Do we really know what the hidden manna is? Do we really desire it? Do we really desire and admire the form of Christ when He was on earth? Yet God treasures Him and hides Him away. What about us? If we do not know the preciousness of Christ on earth, and if we do not sympathize with God and consider His Son's life on earth as dear, we must surely be sick spiritually. A hidden life is the prerequisite for understanding the "hidden manna." Yet what a pity that important as the hidden life is, it is seriously neglected by man.</P><P>Only those who sympathize with God, not only in mind but in conduct as well, can understand the meaning of the hidden manna. We cannot love what contradicts our mind and conduct. There is no compromise between rebellion and obedience, between pride and humility, and between rudeness and meekness. If we long after the form of Christ as manna on earth, we cannot help but live the same kind of life. What we long after speaks of what we are. When we look into the things that a man desires, we will know the kind of person he is. It is only when we live the true life of the wilderness that we can treasure the manna. How cold our heart is! If our hearts remain so cold, even if the hidden manna is given to us, we will not be able to enjoy it. May we stand on the same ground as the Lord did in the old days so that we can truly realize the loveliness of His rejection.</P><P>The hidden manna reminds us of the condition of Canaan, for it is hidden in Canaan. The wilderness is over, yet we can still enjoy the food of the wilderness. The manna was once eaten regularly. The hidden manna reminds us of what we ate before. In the wilderness the manna came only once a day; it did not last long. When a new experience comes, the old ones have to go. However, the hidden manna was collected from the wilderness. It was obtained from the wilderness, but it does not turn sour. Rather, it serves as an eternal memorial in Canaan. Those who have once eaten of manna will forever be reminded by the hidden manna of the fine taste and the heart-strengthening power of the wilderness manna. This is quite obvious. The hidden manna signifies the memorial of what we have once tasted. In other words, as we enjoy Christ by faith in this age, we will have a taste of this again in eternity.</P><P>From this, one can see what a close relationship there is between this age and the next! Many times we have separated the two far too much! We think that when we enter eternity, all blessings will be the same. Yet this is only our idea. It is true that everyone will become perfect then and that everything that is seen as through the mirror now will be over then. One will forever part with the problem of sin, and former hurts and failures will no longer haunt us with their frustrations. Our cup of blessing will be full. Yet, does it mean that our spiritual journey and history in this age have no bearing on the future? Here, the hidden manna will solve this problem for us.</P><P>Of course, in the Bible there are many passages that indicate the same thing. Yet they are beyond the scope of our discussion, and we will not cover them for now. We will only speak of what is before us. Those who receive the hidden manna must be those who had formerly received the manna in the wilderness. What is received now must be the same as what was received before. It is not a new experience; it is an old experience reviewed. Christ is no longer the rejected One typified by the manna. Manna is not something that belongs to Canaan; it is merely something that is brought into Canaan. Hence, it is strictly a memorial of past events only. As such, its meaning is all the more profound. All our spiritual history and our spiritual journey will be preserved forever. Our joy is not temporary; even in eternity, we will still be able to enjoy this joy. All our sufferings for the Lord, our works for Him, all our experiences in Him, whether in realizing His victory, in being filled with His life, or in tasting of His love, will all be reviewed in experience in eternity. Praise God that whatever we receive in this age will not be lost in the coming age!</P><P>For this reason, the hidden manna makes a most serious demand upon us. At the same time, it is the greatest encouragement to us. Unlike what some have said, there is not that immeasurable gap doctrinally between our present life and the future eternal life. Naturally, we admit that there are many differences between this age and the coming age, but we cannot say that they are completely different. In our spiritual experiences there will still be many gratifying recollections. The joy experienced now will still be felt in eternity. It is like a stone thrown into the pond; the ripples expand and continue all the way to the edge of the pond. Man's responsibility is limited to this present life only. He will be judged according to what he does while living on earth. We will receive either a reward or punishment based on our works. Our present conduct affects our life in the coming age. We may never have thought of this. In coming to this point, we have to be careful not to discredit the greatness of God's grace. It is true that grace has put us on the same position. Thank God that every saved and redeemed person has received the same standing, not through work but by grace. However, we should not stop here. If we do, we will be wrong. Although our standing is the same, the difference in the experiences of our enjoyment of Christ in the wilderness before will cause us to have different memories of these earthly experiences in the future. Because the experiences are different, and subsequently because the memories are different, the reliving of the joy in the enjoyment of Christ in the wilderness will also be different. Both the hidden manna and the white stone are rewards in the eternal age which issue from the experiences of this present age. All present spiritual experiences will be turned into happy memories in eternity. However, in those memories, there will not be the sufferings which accompany the present experiences. Those who experience little will have little to remember, and those who experience much will have much to remember. However, everything will be pure joy; there will be no mixture with the present suffering. What a scene that will be!</P><P>Our present world is truly a wilderness. In it we encounter trials and oppositions. Hence, the wilderness is a place where man trusts in God. Although darkness surrounds us, faith sees the eternal arm working for us. It is here that we understand the grace of the One who has come among us. "A brother is born for adversity" (Prov. 17:17). It is in adversity that we realize the preciousness of a brother. Only adversity will make one realize what a brother is. "There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother" (Prov. 18:24). We can feel that the Lord of glory is closer to us than anyone else. What a comforting thought this is! He is not only our Lord, protecting us; He is also in our midst, walking with us, holding our hands, sympathizing with us, and speaking words of comfort to us. He knows all our sufferings, and He knows how to comfort those who are in the sufferings.</P><P>How wonderful is such condescension! How precious it is! Unless a man truly has the experience of a sojourner and is truly poor in worldly things, being rich only through the grace of Him who became poor for us, he will not understand the deepest meaning of the Lord's descending to the earth. It is for this reason that only those who have tasted of the manna in the wilderness can enjoy the hidden manna. The manna was given in no other place except the wilderness. To enjoy the manna, one has to go to the wilderness. Those believers who have lost their sojourning characteristics no longer consider the world the wilderness. Instead they consider it their comfortable home. How can they expect to have the manna as their food? Later generations of Israelites could see the food eaten by the former Israelites in the wilderness. It is true that they were in Canaan. Yet other than seeing the manna, they could have no other experiences of their own. Only those who had passed through the wilderness could say that they had eaten the manna and could tell of the taste of it. The Lord told us the taste of the manna: "the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil" (Num. 11:8). This speaks of the work of the Holy Spirit. In other places, it tells us that "the taste of it was like wafers made with honey" (Exo. 16:31). This speaks of our Lord Jesus. He is a wafer made with honey. It is not just honey, for too much honey will make one vomit. This is a daily food. It has the taste of honey yet does not have the excessive repugnance of it. It has the taste of the fresh oil, being forever refreshing and fresh.</P><P>However, taste is something that a man has to experience himself. A man can only tell of the taste of something by comparison. Those who listen can only hear the comparison from the mouth of the ones who have tasted. Regardless of how others would describe it, those who do not eat cannot understand its taste. For this reason, we have to taste to see if the Lord is good. All those who are in the wilderness have a chance to taste the manna. Those who have not passed through the wilderness can also hear about it, but they cannot have the personal experience of it. What we lose today can never be recovered in eternity. Whatever little we can add to our experience of the Lord, that little we will add to our joyful recollection in eternity.</P><P>The manna in the wilderness was not hidden. To those who pass through the wilderness, the manna is indeed not hidden. In the glory in heaven, we will recognize the man Jesus Christ. We will see Him and know Him as the slain Lamb. The heavens and all that is in them will worship Him. Heaven will have no need of manna, for in Canaan one cannot find the food of the wilderness. The manna enjoyed in Canaan surely comes from a wilderness that is very different from the condition in Canaan. We will enjoy the hidden manna in heaven, but the experience comes from earth. Our best feelings today are but blurry! We only know of a fraction of the power of the Holy Spirit! We have not longed after or enjoyed that much of the beauty of the humbled Christ! Will we fully know His condescension from heaven to earth when we behold His glory face to face in the future? Now is the time for us to examine ourselves. How much material have we prepared now for our enjoyment in heaven? How much have we longed after and desired Christ? It is true that we have eternal life already. We should thank the Lord that we have received this already. Yet this is only the beginning. Have we started on the journey that is set apart from the world, or are we like all others, living in the world? Either we belong to one group or we belong to the other. Either we are outside the world and opposing the world, or we are in the world and walking according to it.</P><P>We have seen that the "hidden manna" refers to the personal experience of every believer toward the Lord, of his personal experience of looking to the Lord, marvelling at the Lord, loving the Lord, longing after the Lord, and treasuring the Lord. All these speak of the believers' enjoyment of the Lord's worth and of their appreciation of the Lord's distinctiveness. These are all experiences of the Lord by individuals. Now we will turn to the other part of the Lord's promise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The White Stone</H2><P>"I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows except he who receives it" (2:17). Both the hidden manna and the white stone refer to the individual hidden experiences, but the former points to how the believers love the Lord, while the latter points to how the Lord loves the believers. In the ancient times, when the people supported and elected a person, his name was written on a white stone and placed in a jar. This was the ancient method of voting. In the same way, the Lord's beloved believers have their names written on a white stone. Hence, the white stone speaks of the Lord's love and devotion to the individual believers. The two things are related and cannot be separated. The basis of the Lord's love for the believers is the believers' love for Him. We have seen the secretive nature of the hidden manna. In the same way, the white stone is also secretive in its nature because the name written on the stone is a new name, "which no one knows except he who receives it." Hence, this secret is strictly guarded. Only two parties know of this name, the Lord and His believer. Other than the giver and the receiver, no one else can put his hand on this. This is a personal secret between the Lord Himself and His faithful believers. It is not known to outsiders. This holy and private love can only be enjoyed by the lovers of the Lord alone and cannot be touched or understood by outsiders. Men like Antipas, who were faithful witnesses unto death, were true overcomers and were undoubtedly the ones who will receive the white stone. Many times we are weak because we do not have the confidence that we will receive the Lord's reward. Those who are close to the Lord and who have tasted the hidden manna will know the Lord's mind and will receive the white stone. This promise enables every sincere lover of the Lord to testify faithfully for the Lord in the face of all oppositions and temptations.</P><P>Do we want such an intimate communication between the Lord and us? What is the hidden name that we will receive? Names are meaningful in the Bible. The Bible often uses a name to denote the characteristics of the person. To know God's name is to know His very self and His nature. A name denotes a person. The Lord will give to every overcomer a new name. It matters little by what name others call us, but we need to pay attention to and be careful about what new name the Lord will give to us. He gave Simon the name Peter and James and John the name Boanerges. In the same way, the apostle followed the Lord's pattern and gave to Joseph the name Barnabas, for he was very good at comforting others. Towards the world we all have our personal names, but towards Christ we also have our distinctive names. These names are not taken by oneself but are given by the Lord. These names signify the characteristics and virtues which the Lord's eyes notice and which please Him. He pays special attention to our suffering for Him in the world, our service to Him in the wilderness. If we please Him in anything, He will give us a new name. The giving of the new name here signifies the commendation and appreciation of the nature and conduct of the ones receiving the name. This is a special association between the Lord and His commended ones. This association speaks of the Lord's appreciation of them. The Lord loves to point out to us what He appreciates in us. The name He gives to us speaks of the thing in us that pleases His heart. We can see this clearly from the Song of Songs. There the bridegroom repeatedly enumerated to the bride what beauty in her was drawing his heart. In the same way, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit the apostle also mentioned the virtues he saw in the believers. However, the name received on the white stone is not announced in public. This is an absolute secret between the Lord and His overcomers. Although eternity is long, it will not leak out this secret! Although there are virtues and blessings which everyone shares, the name on the white stone remains a secret. This secret tells us how much the Lord cares for us! Does not our heart rejoice at the thought that in eternity the Lord alone will still be fond of our distinctiveness and hold it to memory? Will not such a secret drive us to pursue and fan into flame our burning love for the Lord?</P><P>This new name speaks of the things that happen in the world. It speaks of the believers' suffering for the Lord in the world and their attitude and spirit in going through these sufferings. This new name signifies the Lord's attention towards what we have experienced. It also signifies the Lord's commendation in private of our attitude and thoughts in the midst of trials. We do not want to blow the trumpet and let others see what we have reserved for Him; the Lord will reward us in private. Everyone will know that we are rewarded, but they will not know with what and by what we will be rewarded. Others will see us receiving the white stone, but they will not know the name written on the white stone. Even if they see it, they will not be able to understand it if they search into it, because it will be a secret. For one thousand overcomers, there are one thousand different experiences. The Lord will note all the one thousand special characteristics. Since others have different experiences from what I have, and since the Lord's appreciation differs for different people, others will not know even if they see it. Those who know the meaning of the name must have gone through the experiences signified by the name. What we suffer for the Lord is distinctive. According to our distinctiveness the Lord will give us a distinctive name. This being the case, how can those who never have our experience understand this name? We will receive the publicly acclaimed reward, but this new name will have a deeper meaning. In eternity, among the millions of saints, we will hold a secret personal understanding with the Lord. What a thought this is!</P><P>What one dreads the most in human love is to be "common." What one desires the most is singularity. All love demands total commitment. Love does not want to share itself in public. Love requires special treatment from the object of love. One who treats everyone the same has no intimate friends. The Lord loves us. As such He requires total commitment. He does not want us to divide our heart and to love someone else or to love Him in a common way. He has a loving heart; hence, He demands singleness. If believers are zealous in loving Him, they will demand special treatment also. But then, how can He give up everyone and love only one? Yet this is where the greatness of the Lord lies! He has a heart that can love all the believers. Yet He can have an individual and special appreciation and commendation towards every single one of them. This kind of affiliation is absolutely confidential and is not known to outsiders. Does not our heart burn within us when we consider that we have a special place in the Lord's heart and that we are related to Him in a special way that is not possessed by nor known to myriads of other believers? Does it not seem that the Lord is for us and us alone?</P><P>Should we not pursue after the Lord's pleasure? What can compare with this in the world? Do we give up the eternal, priceless joy just for the present, meager, unsatisfying world? Will not such a turnabout amaze us? Why should we who are God's Nazarites and who have received His boundless grace make friends with the world and squander away His eternal, special love for the carob pods which the hogs are eating? Why do we not give up everything of the world to gain the mark of Christ's love instead? Why are we so cold and so reluctant to receive the secret that is only shared with Christ alone? Oh that we would be overcomers to receive this! But then, what is it to overcome? May each one of us ask the Lord this question.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>APPENDIX-<br>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</H2><P>The church in this age is the church that had passed through the great persecutions of the Roman Empire and which was accepted by the Roman Emperor as the state religion. At the beginning, Constantine was west of the Alps and those Britons and Gauls under him were mostly Christians. His army came mostly from these two groups of people. When he conquered Rome and became the Emperor, he accepted Christianity as the state-acknowledged religion. His motive was political rather than religious. His goal was to integrate Christianity with the pagan religions so that his empire would not fall into confusion through religion. He tried to make the church the handmaid of the empire. He himself, of course, realized that he had to be a Christian too, but he was not baptized until he was about to die.</P><P>After much suffering, it was unavoidable for the church to lean towards a compromise for existence. The policy of the Christians at that time was that, since events had developed the way they did, they readily accepted them without qualm. As such, the church stooped and accepted the welcome of the government. Hence, the church lost its purity and was joined to the world. It forgot the Lord's name and its own testimony and accepted what was offered to it by the emperor and the world. Even saved Christians forgot what the church was and how it ought to be heavenly and not worldly. The church should testify of two things: first, the corruption of the world, and second, the love of God. When the church joins hands with the world, the testimony of the church is lost and there remains no distinction from the world. If the world can secure the compromise of the church in a few areas, we will see the church lose all its ground. "If the world is no longer persecuting us, and if it is willing to come close to us, why can we not widen the narrow gate and constricted way? Why can we not do this?" If we are willing to sacrifice the truth and glory of Christ, is there anything that we cannot do?</P><P>Satan's altered strategy has prevailed! Formerly it was persecution. Now it is welcome. The angry face may not frighten us, but the smiling face surely wins one's heart. If fiery punishment cannot change one's faith, zealous natural affection will shake one's purity. At this point the church is already in the arms of the world!</P><P>The Lord said that they had not denied His name. This is because by then they were still quite "orthodox." This was the time of the first Nicene Council of the Roman Catholic Church. There they were still adhering to the doctrine of the Trinity. They opposed the Arian heresy. They were truly orthodox in relation to Christ. However, in relation to the gospel they were perhaps beginning to be confused. Although the Apostles' Creed mentions the forgiveness of sins, it does not mention when and how sins are forgiven. The Nicene Creed acknowledges the baptism of repentance, yet it does not mention the other one. It mentions the Lord's suffering for us, yet it is silent concerning the way to be saved! The Athanasian Creed mentions the suffering of Christ saving us, yet it does not have a single word concerning how we can receive this salvation! Hence, it was an orthodox faith at this time, but the gospel of salvation was not clear.</P><P>The teaching of Balaam was very prevailing at this time. The church accepted many heathen ceremonies and festivals and made them part of the Christian worship and Christian festivals. The designation of December 25 as the time of Christmas is but one example. During the next one thousand years, the church degraded further and further. It has completely joined itself to the world and has lost its sojourning nature and blessed hope. It has become a colony of the world and presumes that the church has the power to change the world and can turn it into the kingdom of heaven. To them, God's promise to the Jews is now fulfilled in the church. The Lord will not need to come back anymore, and His advent is just the time of the Christians' death. What a pity that the church has become fully buried in the world!</P><P>As to the teaching of the Nicolaitans, there was already at this time in the church the hierarchy that rules over the laity. Those who were wise, capable, and powerful became the leaders, and the church became organized like a worldly organization.</P></body></html>
