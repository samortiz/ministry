Such people are most easily satisfied. "As long as I can go to heaven, I will be satisfied!" Such ones live for two worlds. Before they go to heaven, they like to strive as much as they can to gain what this world offers them. However, they do not want to leave the church. The teaching of sanctification is too strict, and the work of self-denial is too difficult. They like to practice any teaching in the Bible that does not come into conflict with their interest, but if it does, they say, "One will not perish even if he does not keep it. So what is the problem if one does not do it?" When there are some misunderstandings, they will stop coming to the meetings; they will not come to break the bread and will not help in the gospel preaching. They are not zealous for the word and are not jealous for God's glory. As long as they can feel comfortable, everything else can get by easily. Of course, such ones will not have a testimony in the world. On the contrary, the world will see in them that there is no joy in being in Christ. The world will conclude that such a loose religion does not mean much!</P><P>"I am about to spew you out of My mouth." Lukewarm water makes a person vomit. As a person dislikes lukewarm water, in the same way the Lord Jesus hates the taste of Laodicea. The real condition of Laodicea has been exposed by the Lord. Its real condition makes the Lord vomit. This is why He said that He would spew it out. He did not say when He will do this, but since He has said it, it will not fail. Here it does not say that He will spew them out only if they remain lukewarm. Their former conduct was enough to condemn them. This rejection is unconditional. In no other place in the Bible do we find harsher expressions than here. The reason for this is that grace has already worked and has done what it could do. However, it still has not become Philadelphia. On the contrary, it became Laodicea. As such, judgment becomes the inevitable end. He would rather see the coldness of Sardis-"I wish that you were cold"-or the sin of Jezebel-"I wish you were cold." But He hates a heartless lip service, one which takes worship as a term only, which in reality is an entertainment of the flesh. He hates to see a brain full of all kinds of profound doctrines but a heart which is cold towards Himself. Do we see it the same way? To us, perhaps the defilement of Roman Catholicism and the corruption of Protestantism are more evil. Have we ever thought that lukewarmness could be the most evil of all? This is exactly what the Lord hates the most, and there is no one in the world more wise than He is.</P><P>What is the meaning of being spewed out by the Lord? Before we speak about this expression, we want to turn the readers' attention again to the nature of these seven letters. We mention this repeatedly because we have to remember this point before we can understand these letters. The seven churches to whom these seven letters were addressed were seven actual local churches during the time in which John lived. They were meetings of the believers and were churches of that day. They had their golden lampstands before the Lord. Hence, they were all saved ones with life in them. These seven letters were sent to saved ones. Hence, everyone who is saved in later generations and who is met with the same conditions as those seen by the seven churches of that day will see these seven letters having an effect on him. These letters will be for him. Therefore, the letter to the Ephesians at that time is a letter to all the Ephesians throughout the ages. This means that as the first letter was sent to those who had left their first love in those days, it is sent to all those who have left their first love throughout the ages. What is covered here is a nature.</P><P>Another way to look at it is that these seven letters typify the condition of the churches throughout the ages. For example, Thyatira typifies the Roman Catholic Church, and Sardis typifies the Protestant churches. If we see these seven letters from this point of view, we cannot say that all the recipients are saved ones, because what the church in any one age includes is a wide spectrum. For example, the Roman Catholic Church typified by Thyatira spans more than one thousand years and encompasses almost all lands. Under such circumstances, there are surely countless numbers of sinners and worldly ones mixed in with the church. Hence, when we consider Thyatira as a local church, we have to say that they are all saved ones who have fallen into defilement. But when we consider Thyatira as a church of an age, we have to say that it is mixed. We can see this most clearly from Sardis. If it refers to a local church, the "death" mentioned by the Lord would refer to its coldness, which means that its work was without any vitality. But if it refers to a church of an age, then the death there would refer to the spiritual life. This means that it has a name only but has no reality and that it has never been regenerated. In expounding these seven letters, we have to present these two aspects simultaneously. The readers should not confuse the two.</P><P>For the church in Laodicea that is presented before us now, there are also these two aspects. If we consider it as a letter to a local church, then we should say that this letter is for the saved believers who boast of their spiritual knowledge but who do not have a single heart for Christ. But if we consider Laodicea to be a type of the church of an age, then we have to say that it is for those present-day lukewarm churches composed of both saved ones and perishing ones. Hence, there are two meanings to the Lord's words, "I am about to spew you out of My mouth." It means one thing to the saved believers, and it means another thing to the nominal churches.</P><P>In the last letter, we have briefly mentioned the proofs of the local church in Laodicea being a congregation of saved believers. However, because of the prejudice of many who have always considered the church in Laodicea as composed of the perishing ones, we will repeat these proofs here. We cannot assume that the Laodiceans are unrepentant and hypocritical ones just because the Lord is not pleased with them. Laodicea was an actual place, and the church in Laodicea was an actual church. Paul already wrote a letter to them (Col. 4:16). Now the Lord charged John to write another letter to them (Rev. 1:11). These seven churches are a complete representation of the churches. Hence, every one of these seven churches is important and must be living. This is why all seven churches were summoned to hear "what the Spirit says to the churches." The churches to whom the Lord addressed these letters were all churches of the believers. Hence, the people there were all saved ones. There was no benefit at the time of the apostles in being a false Christian; the gain was not worth the loss. John saw the lampstand of Laodicea in the Holy of Holies (Rev. 1:11-12). If Laodicea was only a nominal Christian organization, the Lord Jesus would not have recognized it as a lampstand in heaven. Once a church becomes false, its lampstand in heaven is removed. In considering the Lord's word to Ephesus, we know that when a church remains a church, its lampstand remains in the Holy of Holies. In all these seven churches the Lord recognized their works. This means that they all have the foundation of faith and salvation. We do not see the Lord preaching the gospel to any one of these churches. Hence, the church in Laodicea, like all the other churches, must be a gathering of the saints; they must have faith already and must have works also. The only thing is that their works were not good.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 05: The Christian (3) &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
