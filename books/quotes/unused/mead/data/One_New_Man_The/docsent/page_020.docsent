   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third step for the created new man to come into existence is that he needs to be renewed Col 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As long as we have the baptism in the Spirit and the constant drinking, we will also have a thorough renewal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever we drink saturates, refreshes, and renews our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In like manner, when we drink the Spirit, He saturates every part of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just to have the baptism in the Spirit is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need the inward saturation, so we need to drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we drink of the Spirit, we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind Eph 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not just need an outward baptism, but an inward, constant, and instant drinking of the Spirit into our very inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we drink of the one Spirit, this Spirit saturates our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The leading and central part of our inward being is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, when the Spirit has been drunk into us, it first saturates our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Spirit spreads into our mind, it becomes the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is in such a Spirit that we are renewed for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit renews, reconstructs, rearranges our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man is absolutely under the control and direction of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What his mind thinks, he does.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What his mind thinks, he follows.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What his mind thinks, he carries out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The director of our being is our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even after you have been regenerated and are loving the Lord, you are still under the direction of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since we were born, we were always taught, raised up, and educated to be in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our being raised up, our education, and our makeup are altogether a matter in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the schools are intent on building up our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The classes in schools have nothing to do with building up our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This kind of natural education builds up the mind mostly according to the different races.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Different domestic teachings build up different racial characters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you were born and raised up in Germany, you will have a German mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you were born and raised up in China, you will have a Chinese mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is so hard to pass on the gospel to those of the Arab culture because of the way they were raised up and educated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the missionaries first went to China, it was hard for them to change the mentality of the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not so hard to tell the Chinese that they were sinners and that they needed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if you touch the mentality of the Chinese, you are in danger of becoming their enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even in the United States there are many different cultures with many different mentalities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With all these different mentalities, how could we practically have the new man?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Americans are noted for their quick disposition, while the Chinese are very considerate and cautious in what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The British are noted for their politics, their "politeness."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why all the members need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to drink of the one Spirit so that the Spirit can saturate our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The renewal of the mind is for the real practice of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The British, the Chinese, and the Americans all have different ordinances related to their culture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why we need to have our national mentality renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our national and even natural mentality was educated and built up according to our racial and cultural background.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the top hindrance to the existence of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Hudson Taylor went to China with a burden to bring the gospel to the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was so burdened that he even dressed the way the Chinese did.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was very commendable, but we must go further to see that it is necessary to be renewed in our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Merely to change in an outward way could be a kind of performance and not the renewal in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have seen that in this modern age the entire earth has become small.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We believe that this is the age for the new man to be perfected and to come into existence in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord has arranged the outward environment and situation for the new man to come into being, but the outward situation has to match the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is the need of the inward reality in the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Due to the scientific inventions and the political situations on this earth, the many nationalities and cultures have been brought together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now there is the need of the inward reality, which is the renewal of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our national, racial mentality which has been built up through our entire life must be renewed.</S>
