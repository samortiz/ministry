   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord Jesus, we would bow down before You and offer to You our praise from the depth of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You have brought us through the past three days.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen Your glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We praise You as the Alpha and the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are the Beginning and the End.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, You have given us a glorious beginning and have led us through a glorious time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Tonight we ask for an even more glorious ending.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, draw near to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have not accepted us based on what we are, but on Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, thank You that Your redeeming blood cleanses us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Under Your blood and by Your mercy, we receive Your anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, we admit that we have nothing and that we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason You must speak and must point out to us one by one the mysteries in Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May You supply Your word to us once more, and may You glorify Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Shame Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, by Your victorious name and under Your victorious blood, we bind what You have bound in heaven, Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also ask You to release Your riches and to glorify Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>LIFE, THE SPIRIT, AND THE LAW BEING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The message that we will consider now is the key of the keys.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It concerns the mysterious law of the Spirit of life in God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a three-in-one subject.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The three are life, the Spirit, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These three are one; they are triune.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The consummation of these three is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is like the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The consummation of the Three is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Father is embodied in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Son is realized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Triune God has been processed to become the completed God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This completed God is the all-inclusive, essential, economical, compound, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is also the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we talk about the law of the Spirit of life, the same is true.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life is in this Spirit, and the Spirit is this law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, this law is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot tell if there was such a branch of knowledge as physics among mankind two thousand years ago when Paul wrote the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But Paul did use this term law in his spiritual writings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not the legal law, but the natural law, the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, many who are sitting here have studied physics and know science.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through physics and science we find out the laws and principles behind all matters in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Romans 7 and 8, Paul mentioned four laws.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One is the law of God outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The other three laws are inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are the law of evil in our flesh, the law of good in our mind, and the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>EVERY LIFE HAVING A LAW</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul discovered that there was a law of evil in his flesh, which wars with the law of good in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through this he was made a captive and was put under sin Rom 7:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These two laws fit the description of the "conflict between reason and lust" described by the ancient Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Reason is the law of good, and lust is the law of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These two are warring with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the end, reason always fails, and lust always wins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Except for those who have a strong will, who walk by reason, and who temporarily overcome their lust, most are caught by it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The experience of millions of people can testify to this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, Paul said in Romans 8:2 that "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Paul's experience, the law of the Spirit of life is versus the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not only versus sin but also versus death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sin and death cannot be separated in the same way that the Spirit and life cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One law is versus the other.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit is versus sin, and life is versus death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I must tell you that every life is itself a law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The human life begets humans.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The dog life begets dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No one can change this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Take, for example, the sprouts of four kinds of trees the apple tree, the pear tree, the peach tree, and the almond tree.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is difficult to differentiate between them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But when they grow up to a certain stage, the apple tree will bear apples, the pear tree will bear pears, the peach tree will bear peaches, and the almond tree will bear almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This does not come about through any regulations in outward circumstances, but through the respective regulations of the different lives within them.</S>
