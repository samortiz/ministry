   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The saved ones in the city include the believers, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, who are saved by the blood of the Lord because the gates of the new city have the names of the twelve tribes and the foundations of its wall have the names of the twelve apostles .</S>
