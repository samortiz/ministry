   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Those Mourning to Be Comforted</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although we should be very happy to hear that we are in the kingdom of the heavens today, in the very next verse the Lord Jesus told us to mourn.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 4 says, Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not seem logical to say that those who mourn are blessed and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if we pray for a certain period of time, with a spirit filled with the King and the kingdom, we shall begin to mourn over the negative situation of today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The entire situation of the world is negative in relation to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan, sin, self, darkness, and worldliness predominate among all people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s glory is insulted, Christ is rejected, the Holy Spirit is frustrated, the church is desolated, self is corrupted, and the whole world is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, God wants us to mourn over such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the kingdom is in us, we are subdued, controlled, and ruled by the indwelling King.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If, while we are under this rule, we look at the environment and the situation of today s world, we shall sigh and mourn.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This mourning, however, is a blessing, for the Lord said that those who mourn shall be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we mourn according to God and His economy, we shall be comforted by being rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We shall see God s heavenly ruling over all the negative situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times I have had the experience of mourning and being comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must mourn, yet we are filled with hope.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The King is coming, the enemy will be defeated, and the earth will be regained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sooner or later, we shall be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is it not a comfort to see so many in the Lord s recovery seeking the Lord and His kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a comfort this is to me!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have never experienced mourning in your spirit, then you cannot realize how sweet and comforting it is to see so many who care only for the Lord s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, we love all the dear saints in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the churches with all the seeking saints are a real comfort to every mourning spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>C. The Meek to Inherit the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sequence in these verses is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Firstly we are poor in spirit to receive the King with the kingdom and to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we mourn over the pitiful situation and are comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Following this, we have a word about the meek.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 5 says, Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some translators have said that the Greek word rendered earth should be land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But whether we translate this as earth or land, it refers to the coming subdued world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today the earth is a worldly kingdom under the rule of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the day is coming when the Lord, the King, will regain this world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation 11:15 says, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The world spoken of in Revelation 11:15 is the earth in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew 5:5 the Lord says that the meek will inherit the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who are poor in spirit in verse 3 and who mourn in verse 4 are now the meek in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many Christians do not understand what it means to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not mean simply to be gentle, humble, and submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be meek means not to resist the world s opposition, but to suffer it willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be meek means not to fight or to resist.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are meek, willing to suffer the world s opposition in this age, we shall inherit the earth in the coming age, as revealed in Hebrews 2:5-8 and Luke 19:17, 19.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today, those who fight are those who gain the land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you do not fight, you will not receive any territory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the reason there are so many wars.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nations wage war with one another to gain more territory for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The human way is to obtain the land by fighting for it, but the way of the kingdom of the heavens is to gain it by being meek.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no need to fight, but there is the need to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some of the young people have been shouting slogans about taking the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way to take the earth is not by slogans, shouting, or fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The way is through meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Are you a fighting one or a meek one?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you would inherit the earth, you must be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will regain the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, when He was arrested, tried, and crucified at Golgotha, He was meek.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As He was nailed to the cross, He did not resist.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In every way He was meek, meek to the very end. Eventually, the earth will be gained not by the fighting ones, but by the meek ones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Several weeks ago an opposer told one of our brothers, We are going to stop you!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Time will tell who will be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The fighting ones will be stopped, but the meek ones will not be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, they will inherit the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Satan is always fighting, but the Lord Jesus never fights.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Instead, He is meek.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this we see that the economy of God is opposite to the economy of man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you want to gain the earth, you should be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you have not received any territory, this may indicate that you are not yet meek enough.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Young people, you must be meek on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I realize that this is a heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But the Lord Jesus did not say, Blessed are those who fight, for they shall gain the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The fighters shall take the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not say, Let s take the earth by fighting for it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No, you must say instead, Let s take the earth by being meek.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You may think that meekness is related to material things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, if you consider the matter carefully, you will see that meekness is not related to outward material things.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, it is related to something inward, to what we are in our very being.</S>
