<h1 class="series">SECTION TWO<br />FELLOWSHIP<br />IN VARIOUS PLACES IN 1934</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">KEYS TO STUDYING THE BIBLE</h1><p>In studying the Bible we have to pay attention to the following points:</p><h2 class="head1">GRASPING THE MAIN THEME</h2><p>In studying the Bible, the first thing we have to do is to find the main subject. Then we can go into the details. We must first have a grasp of the main subject of a portion of the Word, and then we must find out the various details. The details are supplementary, while the skeleton is the main subject. For example, Leviticus speaks of many kinds of offerings. It is of little use to merely understand the facts concerning the various offerings. We must see how the work of Christ satisfies God and how He satisfies the believers. In this way, we can relate all the offerings to God's pleasure in Christ and the saints' enjoyment of Christ. For example, the sin offering satisfies God, and Christ's death satisfies both God and the believers.</p><h2 class="head1">FINDING OUT THE LINES</h2><p>One must also find the proper lines in God's Word before he can have God's revelation and light. It is useless to struggle laboriously or to resort to some study techniques. When I was still in Trinity College, I read the Old Testament seven or eight times and the New Testament twenty or thirty times within a year. But I did not gain much from that kind of reading. In studying the Word, we can skim over the general verses, but we should pay attention to the crucial verses. I have been studying the Old and the New Testament in the Holy Spirit concerning the truth of Christ's coming again. I am still not finished with this study. I think that I would need fifty years to study this truth in a thorough way. If our daily reading of the Scripture in the morning and evening is a routine work, we will not receive much benefit from it. However, there are times in our reading and our time of fellowship when we are touched and overwhelmed by a certain truth. If we pay attention to the crucial truths in the Bible, we will readily receive God's revelations.</p><h2 class="head1">FORGETTING WHAT ONE READS</h2><p>When we come to the Word, we should read through it consistently without trying to do anything more with it. It is even better if we would forget what we have read. Later, at an unexpected time, God will spontaneously reveal to us what we have read in the way that He sees fit. It is useless for us to strenuously try to understand the Word. Concordance-like expositions are unprofitable; we need divine exposition.</p><h2 class="head1">VIEWING FROM THE BROAD ANGLE</h2><p>In studying the Word, one must view things from a broad angle, yet concentrate his study on the detailed points. This is like the engineers who work at the Canton-Swatow railway; their eyes must be set on the broad topography between Canton and Swatow and must not be caught up with the little ponds, houses, and hills along the route. In studying the Word, we have to pay attention to the big points and not be preoccupied with the small points. This is like connecting two points; the fastest way is to draw a straight line instead of meandering around in circles. Once my sister-in-law went to a department store to buy a pair of shorts. She spent over two hours in the store. The delay was caused by stopping to look at such things as toothbrushes and handkerchiefs. In studying the Word, we must first find the main highway and deal with the side streets afterward. This does not mean that the small points are not important; it means that we are putting them aside until later.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING PRACTICAL STEPS</h2><p>The Bible says that the Lord went into Jerusalem on a colt. If we waste our time studying such things as the color of the colt, the age of it, etc., we are being caught up with inconsequential things. Paul had a thorn. If we waste our time studying what kind of thorn it was or arguing if it was an eye disease or malaria, we are just studying the map and not actually embarking on the journey. If a man spends all of his time reading a map instead of walking, he is wasting time and energy, and his work is futile. Some have tried to determine whether the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a fig tree, vine tree, pomegranate tree, or olive tree. This is silly. The same is true when some try to find out who Cain's wife was. This kind of study does not bring any profit to the spiritual life.</p>
