   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN REVELATION AND THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The starting point of the ministry of the word is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once revelation comes, God shines in us, and we feel that we have a little light within.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, even though we seem to see something within, this light does not seem to remain for long.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems as if we have seen something, and yet we cannot say what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To deny that we have seen anything is wrong because we clearly have seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A vision will appear to be with us for a time and then disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is an actual description of the enlightening process.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are enlightened, our inner being seems to be clear about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet we cannot explain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems as if we are more than clear, and yet we cannot explain what we are clear about.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, we are very clear within, but on the other hand, we do not have the assurance that we are clear at all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Inwardly we are clear, but outwardly we are confused.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is as if there are two persons in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One is very clear, and the other is confused.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After some time, we seem to forget everything except the fact that God's light has shined on us at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps after some time, God will shine on us a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The light comes again, and we seem to see something again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second encounter may be exactly the same as the first, or there may be some differences.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In fact, the two may actually be totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of our first experience, we may react differently the second time by trying to grasp hold of the light for fear that it will disappear again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE NATURE OF LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should pay attention to a characteristic of light it easily fades.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seems to run or fly away every time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It comes to us in a flash and does not stay for long.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It does not remain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All ministers of the word have such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They all wish that the light would make itself clear before it goes away again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They wish that the light would remain long enough to clear them up completely.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the strange thing is this: Many of those who are familiar with the ministry of the word have the experience that they cannot hold on to the light; they cannot grasp it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A man can remember many things, but it is hard to remember light, and what he remembers may not be what he has seen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's light is so great and so strong, yet it flies away quickly, and we have no way to remember it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more light we have, the harder it is to remember it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many brothers have remarked, "The more we read the writings of those with revelation, the more we tend to forget them."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must admit that it is not an easy thing to remember light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In fact, light is the most difficult thing to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We see with our eyes, not with our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more light we see, the harder it is for us to remember the light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our memory cannot grasp hold of light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The nature of light is to provide only revelation; it does not provide anything for our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to pay attention to the nature of light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even while the light is shining on us, it seems to be moving away at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In fact, it often does fly away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It often appears that it is passing away and, in fact, does pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our memory cannot retain light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we do not know how many times a person has to be enlightened before this shining becomes a revelation to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When light comes to him the first time, it may pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He may not remember anything of the content of what he has seen, other than the fact that he has seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The only thing he retains in his memory is the registration that he has seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When light comes the second time, he may see something more but still may have no way to grasp its content.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He may only remember that he has seen something again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Light comes quickly, yet it is hard to retain it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When light comes the third time, he may see what he saw the previous two times.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He may see something more clearly, or the light may stay longer than the previous two times.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But he faces the same problem of not being able to remember the light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He knows that he has seen the light, and he knows that he has had an encounter with light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Light comes again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Each time the light comes, it is different.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet each time he is enlightened, he has the sensation that the light passes by too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It flies away.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It escapes easily.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is too transient.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He remembers nothing of what he saw and how he saw it; all he remembers is that he saw something.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes this light shines into a person's spirit directly without passing through any other means, and its shining goes on in a dynamic way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes a person experiences this shining in his spirit as he is reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Most of the time he receives the shining directly in his spirit, but occasionally he receives some shining when he is reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whether he sees the light directly in his spirit or through reading the Bible, there is one characteristic of light it is fleeting and hard to retain.</S>
