   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING RECEIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the matter of receiving, I have to mention a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those Recommended by Letters</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>from Another Locality</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those from another locality who come with a letter of recommendation should be received by us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we have to know from where the letter of recommendation came.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If it is a letter of recommendation from the denominations, we will not know whether he is clear about the truth and whether he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, those who are recommended by places that we do not know cannot be received by us based on a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if it is a letter written by an assembly such as the one in Hangchow, we can trust in such a recommendation and receive the recommended person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should trust that what Hangchow does is the same as what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those Recommended by</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>the Testimony of Two or Three</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If two or three brothers testify for and recommend a certain brother to the bread-breaking meeting, we can receive this one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a problem among us today of how to receive transient visitors.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They pass by us on their way to other places and intend to break bread only once with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is difficult to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are also members of some denominations who break bread with us but return to the denominations to break bread there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is also difficult to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In my opinion, it is best to have two or three brothers talk with these ones immediately to check whether they are saved and then decide whether we will receive them for the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot ask these people to wait until the next week before we answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are not like those who intend to have long-term fellowship with us, whom we can ask to wait a little.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Three Kinds of Letters of Recommendation</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The letters of recommendation which we send out should be of three kinds: 1 those that recommend a brother as one who has not left the denominations yet; 2 those that recommend a brother as one who is standing on the ground of the church; and 3 those that recommend a brother as one who has some gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Few Things One Should Know</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>in Recommending Someone to Break Bread</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1 We should ask whether such a one is saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2 We should know whether he commits the sins worthy of excommunication as recorded in 1 Corinthians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3 We should show him that the breaking of bread is not only for the remembrance of the Lord, but for the discerning of the Body of Christ and for taking a stand in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first two matters are the conditions; a man must be saved and must be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The third is the teaching; a person must be able to discern the Body of Christ and must take the stand of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he does not discern such things, in God s eyes he eats judgment for his sins to himself 1 Cor 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he does this, the breaking of bread will not be of much benefit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a man is saved and has not committed the sins of 1 Corinthians 5 but does not see the truth about discerning the Body, we must still receive him because we have to receive those who are weak in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I think we have not been faithful to those who visit us from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have not told them the importance before God of discerning the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should show them this point.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if we make the discerning of the Body a condition for receiving a person, we become a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why we have to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we should not forget the teaching of Titus 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Questions</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Question: After a person is saved, does he have to wait until he is baptized before he can break the bread?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Answer: It is best for a saved person to be baptized before taking the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Bible, there is no such thing as believing first and then waiting for a long time before being baptized; believing and baptism are always linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no such thing as putting a man aside for a few months after he is saved and then baptizing such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such a practice is not found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we should not make baptism a condition for partaking of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some have only been sprinkled and do not know that baptism is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should still receive them for the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those from the Salvation Army do not believe in baptism at all, and none of them are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Quakers, particularly those who are in China, do not have baptism and bread-breaking at all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are other smaller denominations which believe the same way as the Quakers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If these people come to us, we should receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since God has received them, we should receive them also.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should receive those who are weak in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can receive them because they belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot make baptism a condition for receiving a person; we can only consider baptism a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Neither should we excommunicate those who are not baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When a person sees the cross, he will spontaneously be baptized and obey this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Question: The meetings in Gordon Lane and Wen-teh Lane are actually one assembly and are one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In receiving a visitor, should one meeting inform the other of such?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Answer: If it can be done practically, one should inform the other concerning the receiving of a visitor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if it cannot be done practically, there is no need to inform the other meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If anyone wants to remain with us for a long time, those who serve as elders in either meeting should stand on the ground of the church and discuss the matter properly before making a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why the announcements made in the prayer meeting in Gordon Lane should also be made in the prayer meeting in Wen-teh Lane and vice versa so that there can be prayers in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that the meeting in Gordon Lane can install a telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When this happens, it will be easier to discuss matters between the two places.</S>
