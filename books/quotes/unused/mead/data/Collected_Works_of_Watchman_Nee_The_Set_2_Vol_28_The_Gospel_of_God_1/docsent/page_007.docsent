   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OTHER SINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This does not mean that the other sins are unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All sins carry punishment with them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament, those who did not love God committed many other sins spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament, those who do not believe in the Lord also commit many sins spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The failure to love God and the refusal to believe in the Lord are the two main sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From these many other sins are produced, such as unrighteous acts, evil deeds, expressions of greed, wickedness, jealousy, murder, strife, deceit, displays of hatred, slander, backbiting, blasphemy, insolence, pride, arrogance, false accusations, disobedience to parents, unfaithfulness, a lack of natural affection and mercy, self-love, the love of money, ingratitude, unholiness, ferociousness, the despising of good, betraying others, recklessness, loving pleasure rather than God, giving the appearance of godliness without having its reality, and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But none of these are the most serious sin that man has ever committed, even though they are sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unfortunately, man does not realize that these sins are produced through one main sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both the sinners in the world and the believers in the church try to deal only with these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems as if the removal of all these sins would rid us of the problem of sin altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But man has not realized that these sins occupy only a secondary place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Though impossible, what if someone had received enough grace to deal with all the other sins?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If he had been a person in the Old Testament age, he would have realized that there was still the sin of not loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although he would no longer have the other sins, his conscience would still bother him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he were a person in the New Testament age, he would realize that there is still the sin of not believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although he would no longer be condemned by the other sins, he would not feel satisfied in the deepest part of his heart, because the Spirit of God would convict him of his sin of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man perishes because of his unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unbelief causes the punishment for all the other sins to fall upon an unbelieving one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The immediate reason for man's perdition is his many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ultimate reason is man's sin of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of this, we have to be concerned with the sin of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, we cannot overlook the other sins either.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE RESULT OF SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once a man succumbs to the power of sin, he commits a variety of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a man commits these many sins, he brings upon himself the guilt or condemnation for sins, the verdict or judgment for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As soon as we have sinned, there is the problem of guiltiness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being guilty is not used merely to imply one's act of transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is like a verdict in court that pronounces one either guilty or not guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a description of whether or not one is legally sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the Bible, it is not our sin that we are responsible for, but our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our sin does not bring in the problem of guiltiness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, the sins we have committed bring in this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible says that if we say that we do not have sin, we deceive ourselves 1 John 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet at the same time, it does not require us to bear the guilt for our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we confess our sins, God will forgive us of our sins 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows us that we do have to bear the responsibility for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because there are the sins, there is guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once a person is guilty, there is the problem of punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because there is punishment, there is unrest in the conscience and the consciousness of being apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sins make us condemned persons before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They leave us waiting for God's wrath to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only after one is forgiven is his conscience at peace; only then will he have the boldness to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But even if the many sins are forgiven, as long as the problem of sin remains, the many sins will continue to come, and the problem of guilt will recur.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why after God has forgiven our sins, He must go on to free us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>MAN'S UNDERSTANDING OF SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before we were saved, we did not feel the evil of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before we became Christians, all that we felt was the evil of the many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even after we became Christians, what saddened us were our many sins, not sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The many sins made us feel terrible, not sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even though we are saved now, we may still lie or lose our temper, and we may be jealous and proud, or be inadvertently loose with others' possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, these individual sins bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What do we do?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We go before God and ask for forgiveness for each of these items.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may say, "O God, I have been bad today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have sinned again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Please forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you did twelve wrong things yesterday, you felt sorry inside.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if you have done only two wrong things today, you feel happy within.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You feel that you have committed far fewer sins today, that there are fewer sins in you now.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But let me remind you that this is only the initial stage of a Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>During this period of time, we feel sorry only for the many sins that we commit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After we have been Christians for many years, we realize that what saddens and bothers us are not the many sins, but sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the end, we find out that it is not the things that we do that are wrong, but our person that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not the things that we do that are evil; it is our person itself that is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One comes to realize that all the things that he has done are but outward matters and that the real evil thing is his person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is a natural principle inside us that causes us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The outward things can be of many categories.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can call them pride, jealousy, filthiness, or any other names.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There can be all kinds of sins outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But within us there is only one principle, and it is something that craves sins.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is an inclination within us toward sins.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is something in our being that craves these outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why the Bible makes these outward sins plural in number; they are realized item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Pride is one, lying is another, and fornication is yet another.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Pride is different from murder, and lying is different from fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But there is only one thing which inclines us to sin, which controls and entices us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The reason that we sin is that there is a law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It constantly directs us toward the outward sins.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This sin is singular in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It does not denote our conduct; rather, it denotes our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This sin is in our nature, and we need to be freed from it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Since God's salvation for man is complete, He must deliver us from the many sins and He must also deliver us from sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If God only delivers us from the many sins, without delivering us from sin, then God's salvation cannot be said to be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Since there are two things with us, the sins and the sin, we need a twofold salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>On the one hand, we need to be delivered from the many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>On the other hand, we need to be delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the following pages we will see how in accomplishing His complete salvation through the redemption of Christ, God delivers us both from sins and from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I can clarify my point with an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The many sins are like the fruit of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They exist individually, and a tree can bear one or two hundred of them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is how sins are.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Sin, on the other hand, is like the tree itself.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What we the sinners see with our eyes is the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We realize that the fruits are bad, but we do not see that the tree is just as bad.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The fruits are bad because the tree is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is how God teaches us to understand the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>At the beginning He shows us the individual sins.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In the end, He shows us ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At the beginning we need forgiveness because we have committed sins.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But after a while we realize that we need to be freed because we are sinners.</S>
