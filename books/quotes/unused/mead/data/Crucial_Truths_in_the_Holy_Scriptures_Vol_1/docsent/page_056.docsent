   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They worry about their food and clothing, their health, their future, their children, and many more things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have no way and no place to go to rid themselves of their anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They can only gain more anxiety; they cannot rid themselves of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anxiety is a great entanglement and oppression to humans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, when we are saved and become children of God, we can cast all our anxiety on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By means of prayer and petition, we can cast all our anxiety upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prayer and petition are the means for casting off our anxiety, and God is the place where we can cast it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we make known our anxieties to God by means of prayer and petition, when we cast our anxiety on Him, inwardly our entire being is unburdened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are so comfortable, so happy.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord is my Helper ; Jehovah is...my salvation; / Whom shall I fear?</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who can overcome fear?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some fear illness, some fear death, some fear failing in school, some fear losing money in business, and some fear that their children will become bad.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People are afraid of many things in the present and in the future because they have lost God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is man s Protector; He is the One on whom they can rely.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without God, man has no protection and nothing on which to rely, so he can only know fear.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But those who are saved have God as their Helper and salvation, so they can overcome fear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since God is our Helper, what shall we fear?</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The world is filled with temptations that trap people in sin or cause people to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Very few people can meet, overcome, and escape these temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the Lord delivers us out of temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we fear the Lord and live a godly life in Him, whenever we meet with temptation, the Lord will deliver us.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, when we are tempted, He makes a way out for us to escape the troubling temptation so that we can be released.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No matter the circumstances, they are never content.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Their avarice troubles them and prohibits them from finding rest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we belong to God, and we have Him as our support and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, we do not need to be greedy for the necessities of life, and we can be content in any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This enables us to escape the troubling of avarice and to enjoy the happiness of contentment and blessing that comes from not being greedy.</S>
