   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He "is not" at the time of John's writing, because Nero died by that time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He "is about to come up out of the abyss."</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sixth one, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when Revelation was written; therefore, it was said of him that he "is."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The "other," the seventh, who will be Antichrist, had "not yet come" at that time.</S>
