Of Plants</h2><p>We have seen that the plant life is for generating, for producing. Christ is the essential factor of the generating and producing life. His life is very productive, and He imparts His life to us. According to John 12:24, He was the unique grain of wheat which fell into the ground and died in order to produce us as the many grains. This is Christ as the producing, generating plant life.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Linen, Signifying Christ&rsquo;s Conduct</h2><p>The first expression of this generating life is linen, which signifies Christ&rsquo;s conduct.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Blue, Signifying Heavenly</h2><p>Exodus 25:4 speaks of &ldquo;blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.&rdquo; Linen in the color of blue signifies that Christ&rsquo;s generating life not only imparts life to us, but also produces a character and behavior which are heavenly, as signified by the color blue. When others see us, they should have the sense that we are not earthly, but have instead a heavenly nature. We have a heavenly appearance, the appearance of a blue sky.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Purple, Signifying Royal</h2><p>Linen with the color of purple signifies royalty. In our behavior we should show forth a royal, or kingly, character. Even the students in high school should be dignified and kingly in their behavior. There should be a certain dignity and royalty in what they say and do.</p><p>To have a heavenly and royal character in our conduct does not come from our efforts to improve ourselves. We must turn from the religious, philosophical, and natural teachings concerning self-improvement. We need to experience Christ as our heavenliness, royalty, and dignity and grow until we become those who have the experience of blue and purple linen in their daily living. Just as a prince in a royal family is a person of dignity, we also should be dignified people, not by trying to improve ourselves, but by experiencing Christ and growing in Him. We all need the experience of the blue and purple linen.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Scarlet, Signifying Redemption</h2><p>For the tabernacle there was also the need for scarlet colored linen. Scarlet signifies the blood of Christ shed for our redemption. We should always bear the testimony that we realize we are sinful and need the cleansing of the precious blood of Christ. Often we need to turn to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, cleanse me. Even if I am not conscious of any sin, I know that I am still unclean. Lord, I am natural, so much in the old creation, and I am still fleshly. How I need Your cleansing!&rdquo; Others may admire our heavenly appearance and royal character, but we should have the realization that we are sinful, always in need of the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood. This is to have the experience of scarlet linen.</p><p>Suppose the attitude of a young person toward his parents is that he is always right and that others are wrong. He may say, &ldquo;Father, I have never offended you. I love everyone in the family, and I am always willing to do things for others.&rdquo; To have this kind of attitude is to be lacking the scarlet colored linen. Anyone with such an attitude may be represented by black clothing, but certainly not scarlet clothing.</p><p>Others can testify that when I pray I ask for the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing. Even though I may not feel defiled, I know that I am still in the old creation. Unconsciously I may still be in the natural life in many respects. Because this is the condition of us all, we need the scarlet. We need the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Fine, Signifying Even, Perfect, and Beautiful</h2><p>Verse 4 indicates that the linen used for the tabernacle was not only blue, purple, and scarlet, but was also fine. To be fine in our conduct and behavior means that we are balanced in every way. For example, when we laugh or cry we should be balanced. We should not laugh or cry excessively or without limitation. However, there are some who laugh or weep without restraint, without any balance in the emotion. It is also possible to love others too much. To love without the proper limitation is a sign that we are coarse in our love, that our love is not balanced.</p><p>Our conduct should not only be balanced, but also perfect and even beautiful. A certain person may be very humble, but his humility may not be beautiful. We need a beautiful humility. All our virtues and attributes should be like fine linen&mdash;even, perfect, and beautiful.</p><p>The more we consider through prayer and fellowship the significance of the fine linen in the color of blue, purple, and scarlet, the more we shall realize what a revelation is unfolded here and what experience is implied.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_277.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_279.html">Next</a> </body></html>
