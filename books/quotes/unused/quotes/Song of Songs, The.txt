God has chosen to reveal it to us in the Song of Songs so that we can comprehend the pathway of love and be encouraged to go on
We must not only have a love like that of Jonathan toward David, but a love like that of the Shulamite toward Solomon
The maidens pursuit refers to the individual believers pursuit of the Lord it does not refer to the churchs corporate pursuit of the Lord
There are many ways to use this word; it can be used in the singular, in the plural, as masculine, as feminine, or in a general way
Friends' in 5:1 and 16 should be translated 'beloved'; it refers to love in the masculine sense in contrast to love in the feminine sense
The interpretation of each verse must make sense within the context of the passage, as well as match the central theme of the book
In interpreting the parables in Matthew 13, the Lord gave detailed commentary on some parts, but made no comment on other parts
We should find the meaning of a term partly from the word itself and partly from its historical use in the Bible
In some instances, the nature of the figures of speech and the symbols are the same; in other instances, they are different
Ecclesiastes tells us that man cannot be satisfied with knowledge, but this Song tells us that man can only be satisfied by love
In the end the experience is the same as that which was encountered at the beginning; the banner is still love
We do know that a longing arises when a saved person is awakened by the Holy Spirit and begins to seek after the Lord
If we do not have such a hunger and thirst, we will only have a poetic song, and it will not be the Song of Songs
Of everything that brings us joy, elation, and excitement, the Holy Spirit shows us that nothing can be compared to His love
Verse 3 says, 'Because of the savor of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee'
Although we have the desire and the willingness to pursue after Him, we cannot help but feel a lack of strength for the pursuit
A life of consecration always comes before a life of love, and a satisfying experience always comes after an act of consecration
Verse 5 says, 'I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon'
The righteousnesses mentioned in Revelation 19:8 refers to the saints' righteousnesses which come from the work of the Holy Spirit
Galatians 4:26-28 says that the Jerusalem above is our mother and that we, like Isaac, are children of promise
Because she has been led astray by the flock of His companions and is being ridiculed and criticized she asks Lord why would You not tell me
On the other hand, the flock also signifies the saints who have died and have gone on before us throughout the past generations
The Lord intends that she secure a place for herself beside all the other shepherds and feed the kids among them
These three verses speak of six things: horses, cheeks, rows of jewels, the neck, borders of gold, and studs of silver
Verse 9 compares her to a company of horses, while verse 10 points out the reason she was compared to the horses
When we see that we enjoy the same thing that God enjoys, the ointment of spikenard will spontaneously flow out
The henna flower appearing in the place of the grapes speaks of Christ's distinctiveness being manifested and accentuated
The first 'thou art fair' encourages her, whereas the second 'thou art fair' praises her eyes as being doves' eyes
If this were the King's word, it would not make sense for him to say in the next verse that the maiden is a lily
The maiden acknowledges that she is a rose of Sharon and a lily of the valleys because the King praises her in 1:15
God would use Moses to deal with the Israelites and the Gentiles according to Himself, and not according to man's natural life
The thorns in Hebrews 6:8 signify the fruit that comes out of a person's own self-will, whose end is to be burned
At the same time, this hints at the sufferings a seeker endures in the midst of an environment of natural and sinful living
The sons' can only be compared to ordinary trees, whereas the beloved has three characteristics: He can become a forest
There are no longer divisions in the church into those of Paul and those of Apollos, which divisions are but things of the flesh
One is joyous because he sits under His shadow, meaning that he feels as if he is being raptured to His presence
The banqueting house can be translated as the house of wine; it is the place where one is free to enjoy as much as he desires
It is good to be in His presence, but the experience of the saints of old shows us that when they were overwhelmed, they fell down as dead
At this point, a person has reached the stage that he should arrive at, not sensationally, but peacefully and steadily
Although she has seen the error of presumptuousness, she has not seen that the Master of the work is greater than the work itself
During all this time, she has only seen the Lord's worth to her; she has not seen the position she should take before the Lord
In other words, she has enjoyed the fruit of the Lord's travail, but she has not allowed the Lord to enjoy the fruit of His travail
Three versions the King James Version, the American Standard Version, and Darby's New Translation use 'a young hart'
All Bible scholars agree that this refers to the morning of the first day of the week, when Christ resurrected
As a result, she does not say 'my wall,' but 'our wall,' meaning that the wall belongs to both her and to the Lord
There is only the thought of making three tents on the mountain, and no thought is given to the mass of sinners at the base of the mountain
Demons can be with the sinners at the base of the mountain, as long as the Lord is within her heart on the mountain
She should learn to trust in the Lord's word and to follow Him by exercising her faith to leap over the mountains and skip over the hills
He is teaching her to realize that His presence can be found under any circumstance; there is no need to look for Him only within herself
Andrew Murray once said that the Lord's presence should be felt not only in our prayer, but in our factory as well
Madame Guyon said, 'Once His presence was a question of time and place, but now it is no longer a question of time and place
When we can trust that the Lord's presence is within us wherever we are, we will not be deceived by our inward feelings'
It seems as if the Lord has clearly brought her out of all the testings, coldness, dryness, and apparent deadness
The Lord shows her all the things that are in resurrection so that she will no longer pay attention to the dead cold dry and wilted winter
No one sees vine blossoms; before the flowers have time to exhibit themselves, they have turned into fruit already
If she hides in the clefts of the rock and in the secret places of the stairs, she will truly live a life in the Spirit
He is saying that the power and riches of resurrection that have been described must be lived out through a pattern
In the first section there is consecration, and there is the willingness to follow the Lord and bear the cross
Both the countenance and voice should only be found in the clefts of the rock and the secret places of the stairs
In order for the cross of Christ to be all that others see and hear from us, there is a need for us to first know the resurrection of Christ
Many praises were directed toward the King, but the entire first section reveals how much the King was to the maiden
He calls her to live the life of the cross and to express the unspotted new creation produced by the cross through the power of resurrection
In other words, Christianity is no longer a matter of our personal enjoyment, but a matter of Christ enjoying those who are His
Rather, it describes the sweetness and comeliness that she has when she is in the clefts of the rock and the secret places of the stairs
The secret places of the stairs should refer to the place of ascension, the place that an ordinary man cannot reach
The Lord can say that the maiden's voice is sweet and her countenance is comely because she is fully in union with the cross
All the sins and natural elements from Adam have been dealt with, and only that which is in resurrection and the new creation remains
We preach resurrection to sinners because they need to have life, and we preach the cross to believers because they need to suffer loss
If this word is spoken by the beloved, it is a continuation of 2:13, which says, 'The vines with the tender grape give a good smell'
After the maiden has seen the King's attitude, heard his calling, and apprehended the complete union, she answers in this way
A person who has freshly consecrated herself does not know what she should be to the Lord, yet she remembers how her beloved is to her
She only wants to enjoy his presence in her own feeling; she does not have his mountain-leaping, hill-skipping presence
In other words, she is seeking after pleasure in her feeling, and she is reluctant to participate in any activity in resurrection
Formerly, she secured the Lord's presence within herself and in her own feelings; that was the only place she could find His presence
She thought that this experience of His presence was the highest and the only one, and that there was no other kind of presence
She has not learned to be with the Lord in her daily duties, her family, and the world in a mountain-leaping, hill-skipping way
Because she treasures the Lord's presence in her feelings, she would rather hide behind the walls to keep the feelings
She would rather not go to the world, and she would rather let the Lord take care of His own work and interest
She would allow her union with the Lord to slip and become incomplete, and she would allow Him to act apart from her
The purpose of the Lord is to utilize her desire for fellowship in her feeling to attract her so that she would gain what she should gain
Her seeking is genuine, but she does not realize that the object which she seeks and fails to find is not the real thing
Those who have had this experience should be led further to leap upon the mountains and skip upon the hills with the Lord
The Lord calls the maiden out of the bed that she rests in, and He makes it clear to her that His presence is no longer there
After the Lord has taken her a step further, she realizes that a rest that depends on time and place is not complete
She wants to rise up and move away from this rest, and learn to experience the rest that is satisfied in every kind of circumstance
When the Lord purposely goes away and takes away man's feeling of His presence, it is difficult to recover it through man's ways of seeking
Although she is still far from perfection, her desperation for the Lord causes Him to gladly reveal Himself to her
In the initial period of experience, the Lord is willing to allow those who seek to find, even though their seeking may not be spiritual
Although she realizes that she needs to come out before she can be with the Lord her hearts desire is still for His presence in her feelings
She does not realize that in a life of faith, it is impossible to retain the feeling of the Lord's presence forever
When He is not pleased to give us this feeling, we should gladly relinquish it, holding on to Him and on to all that He is by faith
Since she has not yet learned to separate the soul from the spirit, the Lord does not put any further burden on her
Although there is a mixture of the self, the Lord is willing to humble Himself and allow her to enjoy His presence once more
If 'my mother's house' refers to the principle of grace, then 'the chamber of her that conceived me' must refer to the love of God
She is a maiden, and her mother's house and the chamber of the one who conceived her must be a most excellent place
From what follows we can see that she has indeed experienced the power of resurrection the riches of resurrection and the life of the cross
God's Spirit does not repeat the record of these experiences, even though failures and dealings are unavoidably repetitious
She gradually comes out of the wilderness and step by step leaves the wandering life behind and enters the Lord's rest
It is interesting to note that the Lord first lived and then died; whereas we first receive His death and then live His earthly life
The maiden not only has the myrrh and frankincense but also everything that comes from the Lord Jesus that is everything the Lord can sell
Verses 7 and 8 say, 'Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel
They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night'
Around the bed are sixty valiant men, every one of them has a sword; the swords are upon their thighs, and they are experts in war
The palanquin, the pillars, the bottom of the palanquin, the covering, and the love belong to Solomon and to her
In comparing these explanations, my personal view tends to consider the word 'mother' as referring to humanity in general
The Bible shows that the enjoyment of our marriage with the Lord is a result of the experience of our union with Him
Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks
Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men
Because of numerous past experiences the King repeats the words that he said in the past Behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair
The first thing a person has when he advances spiritually is spiritual insight; he can discern spiritual things
The believers' foolishness and mistakes lie in carelessly divulging to the world the things that they have seen through the Holy Spirit
We should realize that we will know very little about the power and the work of the Holy Spirit if we do not have spiritual insight
Symbolically speaking, the power of receiving does not belong to babes, but to grown-ups, because only grown-ups have teeth
In pursuing after the Lord, in receiving His grace, and in our study of the Bible, we must not exercise fleshly zeal
If one only receives certain truths, or if he cannot have faith in material things, his teeth do not bear twins, and some of them are barren
In the new creation, the Lord cares not only for our insight, our consecration, and our power of receiving, but for our words also
It is not like Psalm 12:4, which says, 'With our tongue will we prevail;/Our lips are our own: Who is lord over us'?
The teeth are mentioned before the lips because if something wrong is taken in, whatever comes out will surely be wrong
The Bible speaks of those who walk according to their self-will, who are stubborn and proud, as stiff-necked ones
The neck being like a tower means that the person is released; there is no bondage of Satan and no love for the world
The maiden's will has been strengthened by God to the point that she no longer loves the world and is no longer affected by Satan
In addition to the sense of strength and deliverance, we also see that the maiden's will has been brought into complete submission to David
The armory stored within the tower signifies the victory of Christ for the preservation of the believers' will from the enemy's usurpation
These are the holy sentiments we have reserved for the Lord; they are not open, but are upheld with much feeling
At the same time, he likes to talk about his fellowship with the Lord, the Lord's love, His promises, and His answer to prayers
He does not necessarily have the experience of the third heaven, but whatever he has, he cannot wait fourteen years before speaking about it
After the narration by the third party, she does not bring up experiences that the third party failed to mention
After the King's praise, she does not deliberately try to be humble or to say something to show off her goodness
She realizes that she has not reached perfection and that her day has not yet broken; she feels that she is still living in the shadows
The evaluation of the Holy Spirit and the praises of Christ show that she has reached a high attainment before God
The more he walks in God's light, the more he feels the need for the cleansing of all his sins by the blood of Jesus His Son
Although the maiden has received praise from the Lord, she cannot help but feel that her spiritual dawn has not arrived yet
Before the day breaks and the shadows flee away, she has to go to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense
Before perfection arrives, we must go on in the way of the cross, and we must apply the Lord's life in the Spirit
Verses 4:1-5 show the outward appearance of the maiden, whereas verses 7 through 15 show the maiden's inward relationship with the King
After the maiden has seen the cross and resurrection in a deeper and fuller way, the King says to her, 'Thou art all fair
What is left in her is just the Lord's heavenly and holy life, which is fully on the new ground of resurrection
In the second section, the King asked two things of her: that she would rise up, and that she would go with Him
In the following verses, part of the new experiences of the maiden relate to the smell of Lebanon and the streams of Lebanon
More accurately stated, this call is a call to the believers to stand on the ground of ascension and to look down from such ground
Walking on the mountaintop and looking down from there inevitably bring us into an encounter with the lions dens and the leopards mountains
Our mountaintop is still the truth, our mountaintop is still the armor, and our mountaintop is still victory and destruction
Heavenly things can be clearly discerned only in heavenly places, while earthly things can be discerned clearly only with a heavenly view
If we look from heaven, we will not fail to see the relationship between everything and the lions' dens and the leopards' mountains
Those who observe from the 'promised ground' of God's peak will also see things from the view of the enemy's interest
Without position, we cannot identify the enemy himself, and without the heavenly view, we cannot identify the deceptions of the enemy
Naturally speaking, it is extremely difficult for a weak maiden to climb up the mountain and go to the high ground
Verse 9 says Thou hast ravished my heart my sister my spouse thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes with one chain of thy neck
At this point her love reaches a degree that is above the ordinary and becomes pure to the point that a marriage relationship is sealed
By this time everything that is manifested in her is of the new creation, and she can satisfy the King's heart
The King can love her unreservedly because the Holy Spirit has worked on her to the extent that she has become altogether lovely
The difference between Jacob and Esau is that one married a Gentile, while the other married a sister of his mother's household
Not only have the maiden's eyes revealed her desire for Him, but the chain on her neck has shown Him her answer as well
Love is expressed more and more perfectly as believers consecrate themselves time after time and as they are dealt with again and again
From this we see that the believers' appreciation of the Lord's love cannot match the Lord's appreciation of the believers' love
Even when they speak about spiritual things, the way they speak shows that they have not passed through the deeper work of grace
She has stored so many riches within her that food seems to be under her tongue and she can dispense to the needy ones at any time
Since the maiden's dwelling is in Lebanon, she cannot help but have the smell of Lebanon on her garments, even when she walks in the world
Numbers 19:15 says that when a person dies in a tent, 'every open vessel, which has no cover fastened upon it, is unclean'
If today's believers would close up a little more and seal up tighter, their work would become more prevailing
All the spiritual watering that comes to us today is a result of Christ's appearing before the Father on our behalf
Verse 16 says, 'Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out
She knows that as long as she is filled with the grace of the Holy Spirit, she can happily live in any environment
Although the south wind is pleasant and the north wind is fierce, a person who lives in heaven does not feel the difference
The maiden is filled with the Lord's work already, and this joy, this fruit, and this glory should go back to the Lord
Even when she does something, she does not feel that she is doing it herself; she feels that she is a bystander
The resurrection life of the Lord is in her, and the resurrected Lord Himself is dwelling and living within her through the Holy Spirit
Whenever the Lord speaks, the maiden immediately hears, and she immediately identifies the voice of her beloved
Now a completely different revelation is unveiled: 'My head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night'
We have seen the suffering and death of the cross, and we have seen how the cross delivers us from the world and self
Although he has realized the conformation, that is, the molding of the cross, he does not know what shape this mold will conform him to
We may understand the redemptive aspect of the cross, but there is still the aspect of His outward rejection by God
Although we encountered the suffering and conformation of the cross, we were completely unfamiliar with God's rejection and man's shame
The maiden must still learn what it means to be rejected by God and to suffer the deeper misunderstanding and shame of the cross
My dove' speaks of the nature of the Holy Spirit, while 'my undefiled' speaks of her purity, chastity, and consecration
Now the Lord leads her into the deepest aspect of a life of suffering together with Him and in conformation to His death
Only then will they know what it means to 'fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ'
The maiden's past experience of the cross made her a channel of life; those who wanted to follow the Lord had to go to her
Is it not enough for a person to experience the cross to the extent of being genuinely delivered from the old man?
Many believers who have reached this stage do not see that there are two aspects to the cross, the negative aspect and the positive aspect
Her attention is on the cross's work in dealing with the old creation; she does not see how the cross also deals with the new creation
When we walk through the world, we come into contact with the dust and dirt of the world, yet we are cleansed through a continual cleansing
We prefer to live in the same way, not spending additional effort to pursue new things and not losing our present peace
Putting the hand through the hole of the door means that the Lord is doing all that He can to reveal a part of Himself
Men must see the Lord's revelation before they will rise above their present condition of ease to advance further with Christ
How many are there who can tell the difference between being touched by the teaching and being touched by the Lord?
Because of the Lord's attraction, she is willing to accept the cross of shame, just as she was once willing to accept the cross of power
The Lord's life, which has passed through death, is in her hands and it is rising up as a tide, enabling her hands to open the door
A person who is experienced in the Lord's dealing does not experience discipline from God when he is disobedient
Verse 7 says The watchmen that went about the city found me they smote me they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me
They wonder how a person as beautiful as she, who has gone through as much change as she, would lose her beloved
She is indeed like Job, who tried to find a friend who would help him, but ended up with those who condemned him
When the maiden cannot find help from spiritual men, she seeks help among those who are less advanced than she is
The humility, holiness, and glory of the new creation are admired and acknowledged by all, even by those who do not possess them
Although the maiden no longer sees the countenance of her beloved, she is nevertheless the fairest among women
The revelation we have of Christ through the Holy Spirit may become blurred, but the wonderful thing is that it will never be lost
From the time He was twelve years old until today, while He sits at the right hand of God, He has never been short of strength
By the rivers of waters' speaks of their wetness, 'washed with milk' speaks of their whiteness, and 'fitly set' speaks of their orderliness
The Lord's eyes express His sentiments toward us, and to the believers these eyes are as beautiful as doves' eyes
Verse 13 says, 'His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh'
It is no wonder that the believers consider His cheeks as a bed of spices and as sweet flowers, beautiful as well as fragrant
Go in peace' , 'He who believes has eternal life' , or 'Rise and take up your mat and walk' , all these words are based on His death
Verse 14 says, 'His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires'
Verse 15 says, 'His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars'
After we have known Him in this way, we cannot help but acknowledge that everything is of God and through Christ
At this point, the listener's heart cannot help but be warmed, and the speaker's heart cannot help but be even warmer
In reviewing the way we have taken, and considering the Lord whom we confess, we cannot help but exclaim, 'He is altogether lovely'
, implies that a barrier exists between the maiden and her Beloved and that this is the reason He has turned aside
Since she knew of His loveliness in the past, and since they are ready to seek Him, she should be able to tell them where He is now
They have a sense that when she speaks of her Beloved, it is different from when others speak about their beloved
Verse 2 says, 'My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies'
Originally, the maiden sought help from the immature women, hoping that their beseeching would lead her to the place of her beloved
She can now say, 'My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies'
In thinking about His person, grace, work, faithfulness, and love, she subconsciously recovers the light she had lost
Although she feels that she has lost the fellowship herself, she hopes that others would know His preciousness and fellowship with Him
Although she speaks of her past revelation, does not the Lord quietly hearken when the saints speak one to another concerning Him?
Although she is hungry, others are hungrier than she is, and when she satisfies others, she spontaneously is satisfied herself
After she is enlightened, she realizes that she is actually speaking to herself when she is speaking to the daughters of Jerusalem
Although she senses the estrangement in her feeling, she discovers that during the long period of estrangement, He was still in His garden
When she sees this, she realizes that although everything has changed, the covenant between her and the Lord has not changed
She does not follow these feelings at ordinary times, but even during times of her own failure, she no longer follows these feelings
The King's praise is a proclamation of the riches the believers have received through their union with the Lord
Verse 4 says, 'Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners'
In that Jerusalem everything is comely, and in that Tirzah everything is beautiful, because both are God's new creation
Weapons are the most important thing to an army in battle, whereas the banner is the most important thing in victory
God has no intention for His believers to possess only the heavenly beauty without possessing a warring nature
Believers today have lost their loveliness before the Lord, and they have lost their terribleness before the enemy and the world
It seems that He has become weak before her love; this weakness in Him has been displayed often in the face of love
Only those who have experienced the Lord's apparent rejection, delay, denial, and helplessness know the way of the Lord
In the world, this may be evil, but spiritually, this presents a beautiful picture to those who understand spiritual types
It seems that those who are holy and spiritual are not chosen as the type; rather, an unrighteous one is chosen as a type of God
The experiences of individual believers in their communication and relationship with the Lord's love are not the same
Verse 9 says, 'My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her
Being a child of grace does not merely mean being one who experiences the forbearance of God and who is forgiven by Him
The church is full of children of grace, yet only a very small number of people will allow grace to work on them to the point of perfection
Being the only child of grace does not mean that the maiden is the only one; it merely means that she is the most excellent one
Although many believers realize that they are not absolute for the Lord, they know the ones who are absolute for Him
Verse 10 says, 'Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners'?
The Holy Spirit speaks through the mouth of a third party again and brings out the maiden's glory through exclamatory questions
The way of a righteous man in the hand of the Lord goes only as far as high noon; there is nothing after high noon
The emphasis here is not on the waxing or waning of the moon, but on the beauty of it, which is the soft glow that emanates from it
Other than this, the two verses seem to be an answer of the maiden; she considers whether there is any progress or advance in God's work
Now others want to see her and know the kind of preparations she went through in order to arrive at her progress and victory
On the other hand, the Holy Spirit shows those coming after her the kind of preparation necessary for the work
Verse 2 says, 'Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies'
It is not by reason or logic, but by a spontaneous and inwardly accurate feeling, which enables a person to discern spiritual matters
Many teachings cannot be considered wrong, and many people have nothing that others can find fault with, yet you sense that something is off
Verse 5 says, 'Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the King is held in the galleries'
The believers are empowered by the Lord and strong enough to control Him and force Him to answer their prayers
At the initial stage of the maiden's development, she could not have this experience; God could not commit such power to her
In the past, there was no growth, there was no perfection, and there was no maturity; hence, there was no stature
The emphasis is on the feeding; the breasts are like clusters of grapes, good for food and good for satisfying others
It seems that this is not the time for believers to pursue after the Lord, but the time for the Lord to pursue after them
When such a Body life between the members exists , the Lord is drawn to desire the believers and to communicate with them
The emphasis is not on the function of the intuition, but on the fragrance that the intuition left in her through previous contacts
Little do we realize that even in the matter of loving the Lord, there is the possibility of reserving a place for the self!
When a believer reaches this stage, and when the self is dealt with in such a thorough way, he can begin to work with the Lord
Her desire is no longer for a home but for sojourning a sojourning that is not confined to one place but that is from one village to another
She is looking at the signs of life together with the Lord and considering together the areas that have the promise of fruit
Even the most immature believer becomes an object of her concern as long as he has a little sign of life and a hope of fruit-bearing
The matter is not who these are begotten of and whether or not they are in our meetings, but what they can render to the Lord
She has no condemnation after she works, and she is no longer afraid of losing something of the Lord through her work
In the midst of this scene, when the union has consummated to such a height, how can we say that the mandrakes are not giving their smell?
Although she sojourns from village to village, it does not mean that she has to go to a far place to search for fruit
Before she was delivered from herself, she would not acknowledge the fruit in anyone who did not display signs that she recognized
She realizes that there is only one Lord Jesus and only one new creation, but not everyone bears the same kind of fruit
When our union with the Lord has become very nearly perfect, we sense the difference between our inward state and our outward body
Although the condition of the body does not constitute a hindrance, at the very least it constitutes a weakness
She continues to say, 'On that day, His left hand will be under my head, and He will lift up my face to behold Him
Verse 4 says, 'I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until she please'
Why then does the Lord speak about her coming up from the wilderness a second time, as if she is still in the wilderness?
We must not only be delivered spiritually from the wilderness of wandering, but we must be delivered from this earthly wilderness as well
The cross of Christ delivers us from the spiritual wilderness, and the coming of Christ delivers us from the earthly wilderness
It seems as if He sees a maiden coming up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved the closer she gets the clearer her identity becomes
We see that the rapture that delivers us from the -wilderness does not happen suddenly, but is a result of a step-by-step walk with the Lord
By leaning upon our Beloved, we constantly leave the world behind and come up again and again until the Lord comes to take us away
We should trust in Him helplessly until the Holy Spirit exclaims, 'Who is this that cometh leaning upon her beloved'?
The Lord answers and says that she is none other than the once-filthy sinner, who was seen by grace, called by grace, and saved by grace
Thank God that when she first opened her eyes to behold the world, the first thing she saw was the affectionate Christ
She cannot help but consider her emptiness, the vanity of her experience, the undependability of her mind, and the futility of her pursuit
She realizes that whether she can endure to the end does not depend on her own endurance, but on the Lord's preservation
Everything that is not eternal, that can pass away, that is of the world, and that is of man will be burned away
We cannot replace this love with the gift of prophecy, the knowledge of mysteries, all knowledge, or all faith
Even if we doled out all our possessions to feed others and delivered up our body so that we might boast, we would still be despised
Verse 8 says, 'We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for'?
A person who lives in the Lord's love cannot forget that there are others who should have the Lord's love also
Verse 9 says, 'If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar'
If she has established a life of separation through the Holy Spirit, we will build upon her the fruit of redemption
Before the believers are raptured, the Holy Spirit wants them to pay attention to one thing the reward of the work
