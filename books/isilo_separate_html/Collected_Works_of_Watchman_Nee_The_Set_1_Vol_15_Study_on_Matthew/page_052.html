The beauty of the pearl is the expression of life, not something of human work. The stress of the treasure is more on the Israelites; another interpretation of the field is that it refers to the Jews. Pearls are produced in the sea, not in the field. The sea refers to the Gentiles, the multitudes of peoples. The mystery mentioned in Romans 11:25-26 is related to the Jews; the mystery mentioned in Ephesians 3:4-6 is related to the Gentiles. The treasure is something precious to a nation or a family; a pearl is something valuable to an individual. (Concerning the pearl, see the following references: Job 28:18; Matt. 7:6; 13:45-46; 1 Tim. 2:9; Rev. 17:4; 18:12; 21:21.) From these references we can see that pearls are ornaments for personal beautification and satisfaction. The Lord desires to obtain a good number of pearls. (Seeking the beauty of the pearl is the work of the Lord.) The Lord did not say that no other pearls were found; He only said that one pearl of great value was found. The beauty of the church surpasses everything (see Eph. 5:27). The church is glorious, having no spot or blemish (no stains of sin) or wrinkle (not getting old but staying fresh), just like the infants mentioned in Matthew 11:25. "One pearl of great value." "You have been bought with a price" (1 Cor. 6:20). "Sold all" points to the Lord's death. The beauty of the church is the ornament of the Lord. People will see and praise such a beauty.</P><P>The origin of the pearl is that it is produced out of an oyster, which is the ugliest animal. This is just like the church, which is produced out of a most humble Christ. The pearl is produced because of the presence of a foreign object inside the oyster. The oyster spreads over the object with mother-of-pearl. To produce a pearl, the oyster needs to be wounded. The roundness of a pearl completely depends on the tenderness of the oyster's body. The more tender the oyster is, the rounder the pearl is. Christ is most tender (Matt. 11:29). The pearl is in the sea. The pearl of a living oyster is not as good as that of a dead oyster. Therefore, the pearl divers would first kill the oyster. Diamonds are taken out of the mountains. After much grinding, they become shining. Pearls are formed by accretion. Their color is white, signifying pureness. (Even the Pharisees loved to counterfeit pureness-whitewashed graves.) Merchants surely seek pearls.</P><P>Verses 47-50:The parable of the net is the most easily misunderstood. The common interpretations of this parable are as follows: (1) The net signifies the gospel, the sea signifies the world, the fishermen signify the preachers, and the good and the foul species signify the good people and the evil people mixed in the church. (2) The sea is the Gentile world; the fishermen are the gospel preachers, who rescue the unbelievers from the world into the church; the vessels refer to the work in the churches, in which the foul ones are cast out but the good ones are kept in the vessels. According to this interpretation, it is not enough to be in the church only. This interpretation is close, but it is still wrong. During the medieval period, these two kinds of interpretation were very common; the Brethren also believed this.</P><P>This parable has two particular points: (1) Men signify angels (to say that men are gospel preachers is a contradiction to the Lord's explanation; otherwise, as in the preceding passage, the Lord did not have to give a specific explanation). (2) The time of drawing the net refers to the consummation of the age. By understanding these two points, we can see that the two earlier interpretations are definitely wrong. The mistakes of the first interpretation are as follows: (1) It is wrong to say that the fishermen are the preachers of the gospel, since those who cast the net are obviously those who draw the net. (2) "Cast" is in the past tense. (3) The drawing of the net will be at the consummation of the age and will occur only once. However, the gospel net today is being drawn all the time, even daily. (4) The number of times for the drawing-once and for all. (5) If the sea refers to the Gentiles, then this means that the church has only Gentiles and no Jews. (Romans 9:24 clearly says that there are Jews.) (6) The way of judging the tares is by binding them into bundles, which contradicts the way here of picking out one by one. The tares point to the gospel age; however, the foul fish do not refer only to false believers. Concerning the second interpretation, in addition to the preceding six points, the errors are as follows: (7) The net "was filled." But when is the gospel filled? (8) What does "shore" signify? (9) Gospel preachers are not allowed to choose. (10) The drawing of the net here is different from other places. In the text following, the Lord does not say "fish," but "species." (11) If this is the net of the gospel, it should be drawn daily. However, here it is drawn at the consummation of the age. (12) Men surely would not cast out the foul fish. (13) The Lord only said that we would gain people as fish, but He never said that the saved ones are like fish caught in a net (this kind of saying cannot be found in the Scriptures). How can one's being caught in a net be considered his being saved? Unless the fish are under oppression, they are not willing to leave their own place. (14) The gathering is voluntary and is beyond the expectation of the ones casting the net. (15) Drawing the net with the fish in it signifies the flesh leaving its own sphere. (16) The selecting is done in the net. However, the gospel does not judge people; it only accepts. (17) The "consummation" is the fullness of the time.</P><P>In drawing a comparison between the parable of the net and the parable of the tares, the parable of the tares stresses the beginning, in which men slept, whereas the parable of the net stresses the consummation, that is, the fullness of the time, and is therefore given as the final parable. In verse 47, the word "again" indicates that there is new light and, therefore, what follows must be different from the parable of the tares. Three-fourths of the world is sea, representing the Gentiles; one fourth is land, representing the Jews. The sea covered the earth, indicating that there were no chosen people in the beginning. The sea signifies the Gentiles (see Dan. 7:2-3; Isa. 60:5). The land is different from the sea because the land is solid and has substance that can be stood upon. In Numbers 23:9 the people who dwelled alone are different from the nations. In Genesis 22:17 the stars signify the church, and the sand signifies the Gentiles. The net was cast into the sea. The net is the gospel (see Rev. 14:6-13). The age is at its consummation, indicating that during the great tribulation, the angel will preach the eternal gospel, the gospel of judgment. The angel will preach the eternal gospel to the Gentiles. Both the believers and the unbelievers are in the net.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
