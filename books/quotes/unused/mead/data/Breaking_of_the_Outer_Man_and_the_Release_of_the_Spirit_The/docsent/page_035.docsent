   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN SEPARATION AND REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God not only wants to break our outer man, but also to separate it from the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He wants to dismantle our outer man so that our outer man does not become an encumbrance to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He wants our spirit and our soul, that is, our inner man and our outer man, to be separated from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A MIXED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A problem among God's children is the mixture of the soul with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever their spirit is released, their soul is released as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is hard to find a person whose spirit is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With many people this purity is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is this mixture that disqualifies them from being used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first qualification in the work is a purity of the spirit, not a measure of power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many people hope to have great power, yet they pay no attention to purity in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although they have the power to build, they are short in purity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result their work is bound for destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, they build with power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the other hand, they destroy with their impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They demonstrate God's power, yet at the same time their spirit is a mixed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some people think that as long as they receive power from God, everything that they have will be sublimated and be taken up by God for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this will never happen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever belongs to the outer man will forever belong to the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we know God, the more we will treasure purity over power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cherish this purity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This purity is different from spiritual power, and it is free from any contamination of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a man has never experienced any dealing in his outer man, it is impossible to expect the power that issues from him to be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He cannot assume that just because he has spiritual power and has produced some results in his work that he is free to mix his self with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If he does this, he will become a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This, in fact, is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many young brothers and sisters know that the gospel is the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when they preach the gospel, they add in their own cleverness, frivolity, jokes, and personal feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Others can sense God's power with them, but at the same time they also sense the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The preachers themselves may not feel anything, but the pure ones immediately will sense the presence of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We often are zealous for God's work outwardly, yet in reality we mix in our own preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We often are doing God's will outwardly, but actually it is only a coincidence that God's will matches our will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many so-called wills of God are mixed up with man's preferences!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Much zeal is mixed up with man's sentiment!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many stout testimonies for God are mixed up with man's stubborn disposition!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our greatest problem is our mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, God has to work on us to break our outer man as well as to remove our mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is breaking us step by step so that our outer man will no longer be whole.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After our outer man is battered once, ten, twenty times, we will be broken and our hard outer shell before God will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But what should we do with the mixture of the outer man in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This requires another work the work of purging.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This work is carried out not only through the discipline of the Spirit, but also through the revelation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The way to purge mixture is different from the way to break the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The way to purge mixture is often through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we find God dealing with us in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One is the breaking of the outer man, and the other is the separation of the outer man from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One comes through the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and the other is the result of the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
