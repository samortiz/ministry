<h2 class="head2">A. The Lawless One</h2><p>This man of sin is described as &ldquo;the lawless one&rdquo; (2 Thes. 2:8, Gk.). Antichrist will be a lawless person. The entire world today is heading in the direction of lawlessness. Lawlessness is everywhere. Because Antichrist will be the representative of lawlessness and even its totality, the Bible calls him &ldquo;the lawless one.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Son of Destruction</h2><p>Antichrist, the man of sin, is also described as &ldquo;the son of destruction&rdquo; (2 Thes. 2:3). Because he will be so sinful and lawless, he will become &ldquo;the son of destruction,&rdquo; who will perish in an extraordinary way. He will be defeated by the Lamb, seized, and thrown alive into the lake of fire. Therefore, in this short portion of the Word, Paul gives us three titles of Antichrist&mdash;the man of sin, the lawless one, and the son of destruction.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Opposing God and Exalting Himself above God</h2><p>Second Thessalonians 2:4 says that Antichrist &ldquo;opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped.&rdquo; We need to compare this verse with Daniel 8:11 and 25, 11:36 and 37, and Revelation 13:6. These portions all relate the same thing&mdash;that this man of sin will oppose God and exalt himself above God.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Sitting in the Temple of God<br />Showing Himself That He Is God</h2><p>Second Thessalonians 2:4 also says that Antichrist &ldquo;seats himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself that he is God.&rdquo; Paul went further than Daniel in relating this matter. Daniel did not say that Antichrist would sit in the temple, but Paul tells us clearly that he will sit in the temple as God and compel people to worship him.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Coming after the Working of Satan<br />with All Power, Signs, and Lying Wonders<br />and with Deceit of Unrighteousness</h2><p>In 2 Thessalonians 2:9 and 10 Paul says, &ldquo;The coming of whom is according to the operation of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of a lie, and with all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing.&rdquo; The coming of Antichrist will be according to the working of Satan. In Christianity today there is a tendency to seek signs, wonders, and miracles. But we must be careful. According to John 2:23-25, the Lord Jesus had no confidence in those who were seeking signs. Do not seek signs. If you do, you may be cheated. Not only can the Spirit of God do wonders; the spirit of Satan can also perform them. Paul says that Antichrist, coming after the working of Satan, will perform lying wonders. Although they are wonders, they are a lie, a falsehood, and a deceit of unrighteousness. Do not care for wonders, but maintain the principles of righteousness. Anything unrighteous, even if it is miraculous, must be rejected. Do not accept miracles and forget righteousness. If we are strict to maintain the principles of righteousness, we shall be protected from being deceived.</p>
