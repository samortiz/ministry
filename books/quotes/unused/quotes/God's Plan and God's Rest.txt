Verse 27 reveals Gods creation of man So God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them
The man that God's heart was set upon was completely different from all other created beings; he was a man in His own image
; but verse 27 says, 'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them'
It is because there are three in the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet only one has the image in the Godhead the Son
We are not minimizing the importance of redemption, but only saying that redemption was not foreordained by God
Verses 27 and 28 say, 'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them
The direct translation of verse two is: 'And the earth became waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep'
The word 'was' in Genesis 1:2 and the word 'became' in Genesis 19:26, where Lot's wife became a pillar of salt, are the same
The Lord Jesus taught us to pray, 'Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth'
After the fall of man, God spoke to the serpent, 'Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life'
We see that the creeping things occupy a very great position, for God spoke of it after He finished mentioning 'all the earth'
Not only is there the serpent, representing Satan, but also scorpions, representing the sinful and unclean evil spirits
If man has not restored the earth from the hand of Satan, he has not yet achieved God's purpose in creating him
If we are to be men whom God will use to overthrow all of Satan's work and authority, we must obey the Lord completely and absolutely!
In Genesis 3 the fall took place and sin entered; man came under the power of Satan, and everything seemed to come to an end
In addition to the passage in Genesis 1, there are two more passages in the Scriptures which are related to this problem
Even though Psalm 8 was written after man's fall, the psalmist was able to praise; his eyes were still set upon Genesis 1
The Holy Spirit did not forget Genesis 1, the Son did not forget Genesis 1, nor did God Himself forget Genesis 1
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings You have established strength Because of Your adversaries, To stop the enemy and the avenger
God's desire is to obtain men who are able to praise; those who can praise are those who can deal with the enemy
Starting from the third verse, the psalmist again narrates the same old story, completely ignoring the third chapter of Genesis
In this world there are some who receive many hard blows, but no one has been attacked daily and received continual blasts like God
In verses 5 through 8a the writer says, 'For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak
Psalm 8 said that God made man a little lower than the angels, but the apostle changed the word 'man' into 'Jesus'
God originally purposed that man should be a little lower than the angels and that man should be crowned and rule over all His creation
He intended for man to exercise authority on His behalf to cast out His enemy from the earth and from the heaven related to the earth
In this world there are some who receive many hard blows, but no one has been attacked daily and received continual blasts like God
Genesis 1 speaks of the will of God at creation Psalm 8 speaks of Gods will after mans fall and Hebrews 2 speaks of Gods will in redemption
In verses 5 through 8a the writer says, 'For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak
Psalm 8 said that God made man a little lower than the angels, but the apostle changed the word 'man' into 'Jesus'
God originally purposed that man should be a little lower than the angels and that man should be crowned and rule over all His creation
He intended for man to exercise authority on His behalf to cast out His enemy from the earth and from the heaven related to the earth
In His other aspect, He is a man related to us; He is our Savior, the One who has dealt with the problem of sin in our place
Verse 10 continues, 'For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory'
Since the Lord Jesus is the representative man, the rest will be like whatever He is, and they will enter with Him into glory
The Lord Jesus and we are all begotten of the same Father; we have all originated from the same source and have the same life
Redemption did not change God's purpose; on the contrary, it fulfilled the purpose that was not accomplished in creation
Did this mean that God could never achieve His eternal purpose, that He could no longer obtain what He was after?
In the whole world there is at least one man who chooses God a person who can say The ruler of the world is coming and in Me he has nothing
When the Lord Jesus became a man, He suffered temptation as a man and passed through all the experiences of man
We do not mean that He did not have the glory of God, but Hebrews 2 does not refer to the glory which He possessed as God
It refers to Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels because of the suffering of death; Jesus was crowned with glory and honor
When the many sons have obtained authority and restored the earth, then they will be brought triumphantly into glory
We should never presume that God's purpose is merely to save us from hell that we may enjoy the blessings of heaven
God desires to obtain a group of men who will do His work here on this earth, that God may rule on earth through man
Our relationship with redemption is for the benefit of man, while our relationship with creation is for the economy of God
Once we have become Christians, we should not only receive the benefit of redemption but also achieve God's purpose in creation
God requires the other half, that man may rule for Him upon the earth and not allow Satan to remain here any longer
As one descends from one peak and proceeds to ascend the other, he encounters redemption at the lowest part of the valley
On the one hand, God's will is eternal and straightforward, without any dip, so that the purpose of creation may be achieved
God's will from eternity to eternity is a straight line, but ever since his fall, man has not been able to attain to it
Apart from it we would plunge lower and lower; we would be suppressed by Satan more and more until there would be no way to rise
Both redemption and creation are for the obtaining of glory and the overthrowing of all the power of the devil
The commission of the church is twofold: to testify the salvation of Christ and to testify the triumph of Christ
On the one hand, the church is to bring benefit to man, and on the other hand, it is to cause Satan to suffer loss
To cause such a God, who plans so much and who is full of life, to enter into rest requires the greatest strength
The end of Genesis 1 records that it was because 'God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good'
If we desire to know God's will, His plan, His good pleasure, and His purpose, we have only to look at that which caused Him to rest
Man too cannot rest in that which does not satisfy him; he must gain what he is after and then he will have rest
When we have purchased a certain object with which we are particularly satisfied, we turn it around with pleasure and look it over well
Let us read Genesis 1:27-28 again: 'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them
Now read Genesis 1:31 with Genesis 2:3: 'And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good
God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made'
