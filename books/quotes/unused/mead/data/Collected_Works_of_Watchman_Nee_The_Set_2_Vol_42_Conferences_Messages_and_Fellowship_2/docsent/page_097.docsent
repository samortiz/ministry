   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOOCHOW'S PRESENT PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At present there are three problems.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we have to receive all those who are redeemed by the blood, even the weak ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As long as a person has not committed any sin worthy of excommunication, we have to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a foreigner is caught in the Foreign Concession District as a thief, we can put him out of the Concession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if we catch a Chinese, we cannot put him out; we have to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if we have to punish him, we must punish him on Chinese soil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same is true with the church; we cannot put out any genuinely saved and regenerated person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, there should be no problem in fellowship among all the assemblies in China.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fellowship between one assembly and another should pose no problem at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The only place that poses a problem now is Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the workers understand the problem here, but they have not told the other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, ordinary brothers are kept in the dark about this problem and are not clear about it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem of Foochow's fellowship is not just a problem with Shanghai; it is a problem that exists between Foochow and all the assemblies in China.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, there is the problem of the traffic of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is a problem among the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Three years ago I returned to Foochow, and there was a problem in Foochow concerning head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The local assembly did not see the truth concerning head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some wanted the saints to wait for the responsible brothers to become clear before the sisters covered their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They had the authority to request this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consequently, my mother and sisters removed their head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But it was a difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I told John that we did not demand that the sisters cover their heads when they came from Foochow to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But some workers in Foochow rebuked some of the sisters who came to Foochow from Shanghai for covering their head in Foochow, and they demanded that these sisters adopt their stand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But our condition for receiving one another is based on life; it is not based on light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Take the matter of baptism as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether or not a believer is baptized cannot be the basis of receiving or rejecting him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, whether or not a sister covers her head cannot become a criterion for receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of this one thing, our fellowship with Foochow was interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This interruption lasted for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have promised that they would give us a reply in the near future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the Bible, an assembly cannot receive only local saints; it has to receive everyone that the Lord has received.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Weigh is a very careful person as far as his way before the Lord is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He considers everything carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he comes to the assembly in Foochow, and the assembly in Foochow does not receive him, then it will be a problem whenever he comes to Foochow, and it will be a problem whenever any worker from China comes to Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not speaking for myself this time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have been delivered from myself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there is one strand of hope to recover the assembly in Foochow, we would do it even if it meant the three of us going to them and kneeling down before them to beg.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But it seems that the separating wall has become thicker and thicker.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If it can become thinner and thinner, we will wait, even if it means waiting ten or twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the wall can be dissolved one day, like snow melting away, we are willing to wait as long as necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We want to remove the wall of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, this problem has been existing for thirteen years, and is difficult to be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At present, there are three problems with Foochow, but more than three harms have come in. All those who have had some experience of working in Fukien province know how easy it is to get fruits in the work here.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have assemblies all along the coast of south Fukien already, and they are all practicing the principle of Acts 13 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should have moved west from here, and Foochow is the locality that should naturally bear the responsibility of spreading the gospel throughout the whole province of Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There should be a strong meeting in Foochow to bear the responsibility of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But at present, circumstance does not allow this to happen, and this is a great loss to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The most important thing for Brother John Wang is the Lord's Day morning pulpit, but we are after a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our goal is to teach the brothers and sisters to understand the truth about the church and to know life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, we preach the Word, conduct meetings, and lead many people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the other hand, we are here to bear the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The assembly in Foochow should take up the responsibility for the spreading of the gospel to neighboring villages and towns.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>An assembly should take up the responsibility of its neighboring areas in addition to bearing its local responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The money in Shanghai should not simply remain in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It has to be sent to out-of-town places.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The workers in Shanghai do not receive one cent of supply from the local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The spiritual principle is not keeping but spending.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are "saving" millionaires and there are "spending" millionaires.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the meeting in Foochow was normal, it would have taken up the responsibility for the spreading of the gospel to neighboring towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The assembly is a big family, and our meeting should reflect such a family atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If everyone fellowships warmly with one another and loves one another, the meeting will surely be a success.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can predict that as soon as a meeting loses a family atmosphere, the meeting will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The churches in the first century did not have any chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They met in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There were no church bells, and even when they sang, they had to sing softly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible says that in a meeting Eutychus fell asleep and fell down from a window.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul was halfway through his message, but he went down and embraced him Acts 20:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If this happened today, it would have been forbidden for anyone to interrupt a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is far from the condition at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is where the meeting in Shanghai has failed it has lost the family flavor, and it is difficult for brothers and sisters to have intimate fellowship one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This morning I had a detailed discussion with Brother Wang Wei-san.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He thinks that there is no longer a problem among the co-workers and their fellowship, but Brother John does not want to divulge the content of that talk.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As far as denominations are concerned, there are at least four or five Methodist churches in Foochow alone.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We had thought of having another bread-breaking meeting between the assembly in the city and the assembly in Chang-Chien-Shan.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we cannot break bread together, we can have at least two bread-breaking meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This will give others a chance to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Prior to the Overcomer Conference in Chuenchow, we had suggested this already.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After the conference in Chuenchow, the matter was dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now Brother Weigh has also taken the same view concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At present, he has some burden for the work in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>THE SOLUTION</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As far as the problem with Foochow is concerned, there are a few ways to solve it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>First, the fellowship should absolutely be one.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Second, the work can be separate.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Since the work in the city and the work in Chang-Chien-Shan cannot combine together, we should at least maintain a oneness in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As to when we can be combined as one, and what the criteria is for waiting, it is hard to say.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Ephesians 4 says that we should be "diligent" to keep the oneness of the Spirit v. 3 . This is the oneness of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>First Corinthians 15 says that we should be "diligent" in the work of the Lord v. 58, according to the Chinese Union Version . Hence, we must be diligent to work on the one hand, and diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit on the other hand.</S>
