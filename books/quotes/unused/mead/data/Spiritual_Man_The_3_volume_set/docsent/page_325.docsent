   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All these measures are aimed at evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Previously the believer regarded the evil spirits as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, there was an intimate relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now he is clear about this relationship, and he is going to reclaim what he gave to them in his ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One yields the ground to evil spirits in isolated incidents.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, in order to reclaim the ground, one has to remove the barriers one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The greatest barrier to freedom for the believer is an attitude of reclaiming with his will the ground in a general, inclusive, and unclear way, while refusing to claim back the ground specifically, point by point, in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A general objection to the ground gained by evil spirits will only give the believer a right attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to gain freedom, he has to reclaim all the ground in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This may seem difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if the will is indeed for freedom, and if the believer asks for the enlightening of God's light, when the Holy Spirit points out everything in the past, he only needs to resist item by item, and everything will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the believer is willing to press on patiently, he will see that this is a practical way to deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Item by item he will be liberated into freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A general resistance shows that we are opposed to the evil spirits' work, but a detail resistance forces evil spirits to let go and give up the ground that they held.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For a believer to become passive in his will is like going downhill; everything progresses downward until he falls to the lowest point.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to reclaim his ground, he has to turn back and ascend step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has to climb up the same number of steps that he descended at the beginning; he cannot skip one step.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He gradually fell into deception and passivity, so he must gradually understand and come alive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the passive places must be overturned one by one and reclaimed one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As his feet take another step up, he is reclaiming another step.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Formerly, he had another downturn with each step he took.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now, he is making another upturn with each step he takes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should note that what we have most recently surrendered to evil spirits is what we have to reclaim first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The last step of our descent is the first step of our ascent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The overturning of the ground in the believer must not stop until he reaches his original place of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A believer must know from where he descended.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He must return to his original condition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He should know his normal condition; he should know how active his will was, how clear his mind was, and how strong his body was.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He should know his present condition and compare the two.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he will realize how far he descended through passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has to set his normal condition before him all the time, yet still consider this normal condition as the least of his goals.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He should not be satisfied until his will is actively controlling every part of his whole being; until this is reached, he has not reached his normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the process of regaining his freedom, a believer should clearly identify his normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only then will he not be deceived to think that he is free when he is in fact not recovered to his normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should fully regain the things that we can no longer control, things that seem to lie beyond our sovereign power, whether they be our thoughts, memory, imagination, discernment, judgment, love, power to choose and withstand, or any part of our body that has fallen into passivity and lost its normal condition, which makes us unable to become our own master.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should use our will to oppose this kind of passivity and exercise our will to use our faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The moment we fall into passivity, evil spirits will take hold of our passive faculties and use them in our stead or with our help.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we see our own real condition and want to reclaim the ground and use our own faculties again, we will feel that this is very difficult to do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is because: 1 our own will is still weak and cannot control everything, and 2 the evil spirits will exhaust all their strength to fight us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For instance, a believer may have fallen into passivity in the matter of determination.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even though he repudiates this ground and does not allow evil spirits to work anymore, and even though he has decided to exercise his own determination and not be under the control of evil spirits anymore, he will find that: 1 he cannot determine anything by himself, and 2 evil spirits will not allow him to determine anything or act in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a possessed believer tries to overturn the authority of evil spirits, evil spirits will try to stop their prisoner from acting freely.</S>
