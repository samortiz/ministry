   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt represents another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Egypt signifies the world of enjoyment, the world of pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who are involved with this aspect of the world are not ensnared primarily by rebellion or idolatry; they are fully occupied by pleasure, by the rich material supply and physical enjoyment of the world Gen 12:10; 42:1; Num 11:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The river Nile, which irrigates the land of Egypt, makes the land rich in produce.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we were saved, we were not only in the world of rebellion and idolatry, but also in the world of riches and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abraham was called out of the rebellious world, but the children of Israel made their exodus out of the world of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Egypt was rich not only in food supply but also in gold.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is proved by the fact that the Egyptians gave gold to the Israelites at the time of the exodus.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>for His Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The world typified by Egypt usurps the people whom God created and chose for His purpose 5:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The children of Israel were enslaved to that aspect of the world which gave them their livelihood and afforded them their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether they are rich or poor, many today are slaves to money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They work hard to earn a large amount of money and then in a short time they spend all they have to indulge in the pleasures of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus many today do not serve God, but mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was the situation among the ancient Israelites in the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Egypt they made a good living and they enjoyed the riches of the world.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Egypt the children of Israel became strong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Exodus 1:7 says, And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew strong exceedingly; and the land was filled with them Heb .</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The children of Israel enjoyed the aspect of the world typified by Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were not in the first aspect of the world, typified by Babel, nor in the second aspect, represented by Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But they were enslaved in the third aspect, signified by Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because they were occupied by the riches and enjoyment of the world, they were kept from fulfilling the purpose for which God had created and chosen them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same principle, all the worldly people today have been usurped by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, they do not know God s purpose.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Forced to follow a course that holds them under Satan s tyranny and that keeps them from God s purpose, they have no freedom and do not make the proper choices.</S>
