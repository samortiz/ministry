<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Constitution Being Also by the Transfusion<br>of Christ in His Ascension</H2><P>The constitution of the Body of Christ is also by the transfusion of Christ in His ascension. This relates to the transcending power of Christ mentioned in Ephesians 1:19, which speaks of the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. This power toward us is a fourfold power: resurrection power (v. 20a), ascending power (v. 20b), subjecting power (v. 22a), and heading-up power (v. 22b). This power raised Christ from the dead, seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. This same power that God caused to operate in Christ is operating in you and in me. We do not have to remain in the dead condition of Sardis with a mere name that we are living. We can apply and appropriate the transcending power of Christ to bring us out of our deadness. This power is toward us.</P><P>We are enjoying the ascended Christ, and we are seated with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6). All things being subjected under His feet means that they are under our feet because we are His organic Body. God gave Christ to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body (1:22-23). Thank the Lord for such a constitution of the Body of Christ through the dispensing of the Triune God and by the transfusion of Christ in His ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Formation Being through the Baptism<br>of the Spirit in the Economical Trinity</H2><P>We have seen what the Body of Christ is and also how the Body of Christ is constituted with the processed Triune God. Now we need to see how the Body of Christ was formed through the baptism of the Spirit in the economical Trinity. First Corinthians 12:13 says, "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body." This shows that the Body of Christ was formed through the baptism of the Spirit.</P><P>In order to form the Body of Christ, the Triune God passed through a wonderful process. He was incarnated as a man and passed through crucifixion and resurrection. In resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In John 20 the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples in resurrection and breathed into them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (v. 22). He breathed Himself as the Spirit into them to impart Himself as life into them. Then He told them to stay in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high (Luke 24:49). This is concerning the outpouring of the Spirit as the power from on high and is different from the Spirit of life breathed into the disciples on the day of His resurrection.</P><P>Fifty days after Christ's resurrection, on the day of Pentecost, the economical Spirit of the ascension power was poured out upon the disciples. Acts 2 shows us that on the day of Pentecost, the Jewish believers, the first part of Christ's Body, were baptized (vv. 1-4). In the house of Cornelius the Gentile believers, the second part of His Body, were baptized in the same way (10:44-47). By these two steps both the Jews and the Gentiles were formed into the Body of Christ through the baptism of the Spirit. The Body came into existence, and we are in this one Body. God has given us the Spirit as life but He has also clothed us with the Spirit as power. The Body of Christ is not only constituted with life but also clothed with the transcendent power of Christ to carry out God's work and move on the earth today for His eternal economy.</P>
