Ephesians covers the church as the Body of Christ, whereas Colossians deals with Christ as the Head of the Body
Because in our spiritual experience there is the need for us to be reduced, we must be ready for winter at the appointed time
We may say that Galatians is a winter book, a book that reduces us and eliminates everything that should not be permanent
We need to be reduced not only in things that are natural or worldly, but even in the various aspects of our spiritual experience
Whenever we come to a winter in our experience with the Lord, we should be encouraged that spring and summer will follow in due time
In order to study the book of Galatians properly, it is important to know the background and the subject of this book
The more negative a certain background is, the greater is the opportunity for the Lord to release His revelation
If there had not been such a dark background at the end of the first century, this wonderful Gospel probably would not have been written
If we did not have the book of 1 Corinthians, we would not know how Christ could be our enjoyment in all kinds of situations
Apart from such a situation and background, the truth of justification by faith would not be as clear as it is today
The book of Galatians reveals that the very Christ whom we need for the church life is versus law and religion
The observance of the law could never be a gospel that sets free the sinners under its bondage and brings them into the enjoyment of God
Although they had been justified in Christ, they had gone back to keeping the law and were trying to be justified by the works of the law
The true circumcision that cuts off the flesh is not the circumcision practiced in the Old Testament; it is the crucifixion of Christ
The Galatians were trying to perfect themselves through their own effort, through the works of the flesh, in which there is nothing good
The various ages of the satanic system are expressed in the fashions of clothing that prevail during a certain period of time
By these illustrations of neckties and hair nets we can see that the world system of Satan has different ages, different sections
He desires to rescue the churches which were distracted by Judaism with its law and to bring them back to the grace of the gospel
His intention in writing to the Galatians was to rescue the distracted believers from the tyranny of the present evil religious age
In 1:4 Paul points out that in order to rescue us from the present evil religious age Christ gave Himself for our sins
In John 10 we see that Christ as the good Shepherd entered into the fold in order to bring His sheep out of the fold and into the pasture
Christ has come as the Shepherd to bring the sheep out of that fold to the pasture where they may feed on His riches
In Ephesians 2 we see that He gave Himself in order to abolish the ordinances for the creation of the one new man
In Galatians 1 we see that Christ gave Himself for our sins for the purpose of rescuing us out of religion, out of the present evil age
Christ is seeking to rescue His sheep out of the various religious folds and to bring them together as the one flock
Christ's death on the cross to deliver us from the present evil age was according to the will of God, the Father
Although we do not proselytize, we do desire that the Lord's sheep may be led out of the fold and into the flock
Through His death on the cross, the Lord gave Himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the religious fold
At the very opening of this book Paul emphasized the fact that he became an apostle not from men nor through man but through Christ and God
He says that he did not become an apostle 'from men'; he goes on to say that his apostleship was not 'through man'
He was made an apostle directly through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Christ from among the dead
Paul does not say here, 'God the Father who gave the law through Moses'; he says, 'God the Father who raised Christ from among the dead'
God's New Testament economy is not with man in the old creation, but with man in the new creation through the resurrection of Christ
Paul's apostleship belonged altogether to the new creation, which transpires in our spirit through regeneration by the Spirit of God
Matthew reveals that Christ, the Son of David, came as the King to establish the kingdom of the heavens on earth
According to Luke 24:47, repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in the name of Christ among all nations
We have pointed out that Matthew is the gospel of the kingdom, that John is the gospel of life, and that Luke is the gospel of forgiveness
In Colossians 1:25 Paul says that he became a minister according to the stewardship of God to complete the word of God
Mark may be regarded as Peter's spiritual son , and he drew upon Peter as the source for much of the material in his Gospel
Although John tells us that Christ is the vine and that we are the branches he does not say that Christ is the Head and that we are the Body
It is crucial for us to see that Paul's ministry was a completing ministry, a ministry of completing the divine revelation
Paul's Epistles not only complete the divine revelation; they form the very heart of God's revelation in the New Testament
In the four Gospels we are not told that Christ is the mystery of God or that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily
There is no doubt that Matthew speaks clearly and emphatically about the kingdom, which is a matter of administration
Some Christians boast that they accept all ministries, but actually they do not wholly accept the ministry of Paul
Even some of today's pastors do not adequately know Paul's gospel revealed in the one hundred chapters of his Epistles
Those who preach a so-called gospel that is different from the unique gospel pervert and distort the gospel of Christ and should be accursed
The expressions Paul uses are too wonderful to have come from any source other than a revelation directly from the Lord Jesus Christ
As a slave of Christ, he preached the gospel according to the revelation he received, not to please men, but to please God
The Jewish religion was composed not only of the God-given law and its rituals, but also of man-made traditions
Because Paul was so zealous for the traditions of his fathers he became a leading religionist and advanced beyond many of his contemporaries
At the time appointed by God, when Saul, zealous in his religion, was persecuting the church, the Son of God was revealed to him
God could bear with Saul's zeal for the traditions of his fathers, for this produced a dark background against which to reveal Christ
The desire of God's heart is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life , and become the sons of God
The Judaizers bewitched the Galatians so that they considered the ordinances of the law above the Son of the living God
The apostle in the opening of this Epistle testified that he had been deeply involved in that realm and far advanced in it
God, however, had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God's eyes, by revealing His Son in him
God made the Apostle Paul a minister of Christ by setting him apart, calling him, and revealing His Son in him
Of focusing his attention on this living Person, man has a natural tendency to direct his attention to religion with its tradition
The record of the experience of the disciples with the Lord Jesus on the mount of transfiguration illustrates this
Although it is doubtful that Moses and Elijah were in glory, they nonetheless were speaking with the glorified Jesus
He was heir of the centuries-old tradition concerning Moses, who represented the law, and Elijah, who represented the prophets
How foolish to treasure the seventh-day Sabbath when we can enjoy Christ as our real Sabbath and as the reality of every day!
Those who specialize in the lengthening of legs should call themselves 'leg-lengtheners,' not ministers of Christ
A great many Christians care for religion and traditions, but they do not care for the living Person of Christ
The focal point of the Bible is not practices, doctrines, or ordinances-it is the living Person of the Son of God
Concerning the Son of God, many are still under the influence of the traditional teachings in Christianity with respect to the Trinity
We cannot have the grace of Christ the Son without the love of God the Father or the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
It is significant that in Galatians 1:15 and 16 Paul does not say that God revealed Christ in him, but that He revealed His Son in him
The reason for this difference is that whenever we speak of the Son of God, we are immediately involved with the Father and the Spirit
As we have pointed out repeatedly, the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the Spirit for our enjoyment
It is quite possible that even among us in the Lord's recovery we may care for any number of things instead of Christ
Although this living Person is so all-inclusive, He is very practical to us, for, as the life-giving Spirit, He is in our regenerated spirit
We also need to see that a very high degree of intelligence was required to interpret this revelation and to express it in words
Others may receive such a revelation, but, unlike Paul, they may not have the ability to understand it and to convey it in language
According to his darkened mentality, nothing could compare to Judaism with its law, Scriptures, priestly service, and traditions
Now Saul was shocked to realize that Jesus was living, was speaking from the heavens, and was being revealed to him
Pray that they will see this living Person and care for Him instead of things such as the Sabbath head covering healing and spiritual gifts
We need to pray that we shall care for this living Person more than anything, even more than for the church life
Without this living Person as the reality and content of the church life, even the church life will become a tradition
We should not treasure anything, including our Bible knowledge or spiritual experience and attainments, in place of this living Person
Because this living Person is everything to us, there is no need for us to seek mere holiness, spirituality, victory, love, or submission
As the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, He is within us to be whatever we need
From the beginning of the Bible to the end, especially in the New Testament, Christ occupies the central place
As we review our past experience, we shall have to admit that in our reading of the Bible we did not see much of Christ
If you contact orthodox Jews today and speak to them about Christ, you will realize that they are covered with a thick, strong veil
In his subtlety, Satan has blinded people to the fact that they have a spirit, or has otherwise kept them from using their spirit
These veils not only frustrate them from knowing Christ, but often keep them from recognizing the church people as genuine Christians
It is crucial that we be on the alert, for it is possible for anything that is not Christ Himself to be used as a veil by the subtle one
Our problem is that our heart is turned away to many other things, and therefore we are covered with layer upon layer of veils
When Saul was on the way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus appeared to him from the heavens, and spontaneously Saul called, 'Who art thou, Lord'?
The light of the gospel of the glory of Christ shined into Saul of Tarsus, and he saw the glory of God in the face of Christ
The more you turn your heart to the Lord, the less ground the god of this age will have in your life and in your being
Because the mind plays an important part, it is crucial that we drop our concepts, all of which are in the mind
If we hold on to concepts in our mind, the revelation may be in our spirit, but it will not be able to penetrate our veiled mentality
The subjective revelation about which we are speaking here is concerned only with the living Person of the Son of God
The more He lives in us, the more He will become to us the unique and central blessing of the gospel which God promised to Abraham
The book of Galatians eventually brings us to the new creation by way of the inward revelation of the living Person of the Son of God
The proper way to answer is to reply that according to life we are males, but according to love we are females
It was as a matter of life that he was made a pattern for all the believers, the brothers and the sisters as well
As we consider the various points in this message, we need to see how we can follow Paul's pattern and be formed into apostles
When we read about Paul being set apart from his mother's womb, we may have the concept that this was true of him, but not of us
Surely to be chosen from before the foundation of the world is more crucial than to be set apart from our mother's womb
Since you have been chosen from before the foundation of the world, do you not believe that you were also set apart from your mother's womb?
Some teachers of the Bible have different opinions concerning the time that Paul was separated from his mother's womb
The main point here is that according to His selection we were chosen by God in eternity, before the foundation of the world
To be set apart from our mother's womb is related to the accomplishment in time of the selection God made in eternity
We thank the Lord that Saul of Tarsus was not born a hundred years before the Lord Jesus, nor six hundred years afterward
Both Peter and Paul were chosen before the foundation of the world, and both were set apart at precisely the right time
We all were selected in eternity when Paul was selected; however, we were set apart from our mother's womb at different times
If we spend time to review our past, we shall see that God's calling of us began with our conception in the womb
Everything related to us, such as our family and education, is according to God's sovereignty and related to His calling of us
Since Paul is a pattern of the believers and the Son of God was revealed in him, we also should have Christ revealed in us
Some of you may have spoken to certain preachers or ministers, only to find that you were discouraged by your contact with them
Some of the leading ones may be concerned that such a word will cause the saints not to seek the proper fellowship
If we would be today's apostles, we should follow Paul's pattern in not going up to Jerusalem to confer with others
After receiving revelation, at the proper time we need to contact those members of the Lord's Body who came to know the Lord ahead of us
To say this is also to strengthen the point that Paul did not receive the gospel from any who were believers in Christ before him
In verses 23 and 24 Paul concludes, 'But they only heard that he who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which formerly he ravaged
The churches, including all the believers in Christ in Judea, only heard the news of Paul's conversion and glorified God in him
In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that Paul was a pattern for the believers, especially for Gentile believers
In writing this Epistle, Paul was endeavoring to restore the Galatian believers who had been overtaken by their weakness
Those who take the lead in the churches must learn to be honest, faithful, frank, and bold, yet all of this with meekness
In this realm, the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, there should not be any lying; neither should there be any playing of politics
As recorded in Acts 15, this happened after a number of churches had been raised up in the Gentile world by Paul's preaching
In 2:1 and 2 we see that after a period of fourteen years, he went up to Jerusalem again, according to revelation
Not only Pauls gospel but also his going up to Jerusalem was according to the Lords revelation not according to any organization or system
The Judaizers had caused a great deal of trouble by telling the Gentile believers that they had to be circumcised in order to be saved
If we were going up to Jerusalem in that situation, we probably would have gone up with a great deal of fanfare
Announcement of the coming of a well-known preacher or evangelist is made in advance in order to assure a large crowd
In verse 3 Paul goes on to say, 'But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised'
The false brothers to whom Paul refused to be subject were spreading the concept that believers had to be circumcised in order to be saved
In order to maintain this freedom, Paul refused to have Titus circumcised or to yield in subjection to the Judaizers
Paul refused to yield in subjection to the false brothers so that the truth of the gospel might remain with the believers
He describes our regenerated spirit, renewed heart, transformed soul, renewed mind, and the condition of our physical body
Paul and Barnabas were apostles to the uncircumcision, to the Gentiles, whereas those in Jerusalem were apostles to the circumcision
The attitude of superiority that prevailed in Jerusalem was a factor that contributed to the destruction of that city in 70 A
Peter, John, and James were older than Paul and were apostles when he was still a young man persecuting the followers of the Lord Jesus
Both in Galatians 2:12 and Acts 21:18, James was considered the representative of the church in Jerusalem and of the apostles
It strongly refutes the assertion of Catholicism that Peter was the only successor of Christ in the administration of the church
Because Paul was honest, faithful, frank, and bold, he opposed Peter to his face when Peter was not faithful to the truth of the gospel
When certain ones came from James, Peter 'shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision'
What weakness and backsliding to shrink from eating with Gentile believers out of fear of those of the circumcision!
It is almost incredible that Peter, the leading apostle, practiced hypocrisy in relation to the truth of the gospel
At least twice in the New Testament we are told that Peter took the lead in a negative way and that others followed him
Barnabas participated in Paul's first journey to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to raise up the Gentile churches
Even though he did not forget the vision, he behaved in a hypocritical way with respect to eating with the Gentiles
In the book of Galatians Paul presents a number of contrasts between things that are superior and things that are inferior
As we read these terms in the Scriptures, we may take them for granted without having a proper and adequate understanding
Such strong negative terms as false brothers stole in and spy out should impress us with the fact that freedom in Christ is a great matter
Because we are free in Christ, we are no longer obligated to the law and its ordinances, practices, and regulations
Anyone who tries to keep the law makes himself a debtor to the ordinances, practices, and regulations of the law
Proper freedom is not only liberation from obligation; it is also full satisfaction because of an adequate supply and support
Those who still observe the Sabbath day do not have true rest because their efforts to keep the Sabbath place them under a heavy burden
As you consider this description of freedom in Christ, you will find that it corresponds to your experience with the Lord
Satan, the subtle one, sent in the Judaizers to spy out this freedom and to deprive the Galatian believers of this treasure
He wanted to take away their liberation from obligation and their satisfaction, their rest, and their enjoyment of Christ
It refers in particular to the labor of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations
If we consider this contrast between freedom in Christ and slavery under law, we shall be full of praise to the Lord
The slavery under law spoken of in Galatians is not the same as the slavery of the children of Israel under Pharaoh
In 321 Paul spoke like a skillful debater If a law was given which was able to give life righteousness would have indeed been of the law
All those who endeavor to keep the law, such as the Seventh-Day Adventists, are today's Ishmaels brought forth by Hagar
For this reason, they do not participate in God's promise and have no enjoyment of life in grace by the Spirit
As we consider the matter of freedom in Christ, we need to see that Christ as the life-giving Spirit imparts life by grace
Christ as the life-giving Spirit imparts life into us by the Triune God who has been processed to become our enjoyment
When we come to chapter four, we shall see that these women are an allegory signifying two covenants that bring forth two kinds of children
When we received Christ as life, we became sons of God to inherit the blessing promised by God for the fulfillment of God's purpose
The word truth in these verses does not mean the doctrine or teaching of the gospel; it denotes the reality of the gospel
In verse 7 Paul refers to the commandment about coveting: 'I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet'
If you look into the Ten Commandments, you will see that they embody the divine holiness, righteousness, light, and love
When the people declared that they would keep God's commandments, the atmosphere changed and became terrifying
The law was used by God as a custodian to keep His people just as a fold keeps a flock of sheep during the winter or during a storm
In verse 24 he goes on to say, 'So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith'
The proper preaching of the gospel is not the preaching of a doctrine; it is the preaching of the Person of the Son of God
No matter what the subject of our gospel message may be, the focal point of our preaching must be this living Person
The faith in Christ by which believers are justified is related to their appreciation of the Person of the Son of God
The more we describe Him and speak of His preciousness, the more something will be infused into the being of the listeners
As Christ's preciousness is infused into us through the preaching of the gospel, we spontaneously appreciate the Lord and call on Him
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we had this kind of experience, although we did not have the terminology to explain it
The organic union with Christ is accomplished spontaneously through the living faith produced by our appreciation of Him
The crucial point in that message was the organic union with Christ which takes place spontaneously when we believe in Christ
If we are not actually organically united with Christ but are in ourselves, then we are neither dead to law nor are we living to God
In Romans 11 Paul goes on to use another illustration- the grafting of a branch from one tree into another tree
In Romans 11:17-24 Paul uses the illustration of branches from a wild olive tree being grafted into a cultivated olive tree
As a result of grafting, the branches from the wild olive tree and the cultivated olive tree grow together organically
Although this is correct it is also true that in the Bible the real Israel is always identified with Christ and Christ with the real Israel
In the death of Christ our old life was cut off, and in Christ's resurrection we were united to Him for further growth
The experience of the death of Christ causes us to die to the law, whereas resurrection enables us to live to God
When the preciousness of the Lord Jesus was infused into us and we began to appreciate Him, we were grafted into Him
On the negative side, we have been cut in Christ's death; on the positive side, we have been united to Christ in His resurrection
According to Galatians 6, we are dead to the world, particularly to the religious world, through the crucifixion of Christ
By the all-inclusive cutting of Christ's all-inclusive death on the cross, we are dead to everything other than God
Having been cut off from everything other than God, we are dead to religion, including Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism
One aspect of our history includes the crucifixion by which we have been cut off from everything other than God
As we tell the Lord Jesus that we love Him, we experience the operation of genuine faith that is implied in our appreciation of Him
In this union we realize that His history is our history; with Christ we have been crucified, buried, and resurrected
If the older saints have a greater appreciation of the Lord, their condemnation of the young people will be swallowed up
Just as the older saints have the tendency to condemn the young ones, the young ones may not appreciate the older ones
In Christ's death we are through with the law, and in His resurrection we are responsible to God in the resurrection life
As long as we still hold to any kind of law, whether the Mosaic law or our self-made law, we cannot live to God
Whenever we have a certain self-made law, we always strive to keep it by the strength of the flesh, not by the Spirit
To be living unto God is to be obligated to God in the divine life, to be responsible to God in the resurrection life
To live in the faith of the Son of God means to live in the organic union with the Son of God which comes through our believing in Him
If we present Him adequately, others will be infused with His preciousness, and they will spontaneously appreciate Him
The new 'I' still lives, the 'I' that came into being when the old 'I' was resurrected and had God added to it
The life which we now live in the flesh is not bios, the physical life, not psuche, the soulish life, but zoe, the spiritual and divine life
According to our Christian experience, the genuine living faith which operates in us is not only in Christ, but also of Christ
We have also pointed out that genuine faith is Christ Himself infused into us to become our ability to believe in Him
Faith is related not only to the Christ who has been infused into us, but also to the Christ who is infusing Himself into us
Proof that the faith in 2:20 is both the faith of Christ and the faith in Christ is found in Paul's words at the end of the verse
As we consider these verses, we can see that Paul's faith came from an appreciation for the constraining love of Christ
The Galatians had turned from God's economy and had gone back to the law, which they were trying to keep by the efforts of the flesh
God's New Testament economy is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into us to become our life and our very being
If we see this, we shall be able to proclaim that we have been crucified with Christ and that we live no longer
Now we live by faith in the Son of God and of the Son of God, a faith that produces an organic union in which we and Christ are one
In His economy God's intention is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into our being to make us a new person, a new 'I'
The old person, the old 'I,' the 'I' without God, is over; but the new person, the new 'I,' the 'I' with the Triune God in it, still lives
From that time until now, He has been working and moving on earth, seeking those who will appreciate Him and call on His name
It is important for us to find out the genuine and proper significance of the grace of God in the New Testament
Approximately another fifteen hundred years passed before grace came with Jesus Christ, with the incarnated Son of God
Grace is God in His Trinity processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to be everything to us
If we would understand grace as revealed in the New Testament, we need a clear view of the New Testament as a whole
The fact that the coming of grace is contrasted with the giving of the law indicates that grace is greater than the law
We have pointed out that in 2:20 Paul says that he has been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in him
Paul closes the Epistle to the Galatians by saying, 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers'
As we have pointed out emphatically, grace is God Himself in a subjective way to be everything for our enjoyment
Although man was created in God's image and likeness in order to express Him and represent Him, man became fallen
In the fall man not only did something wrong outwardly, but the very nature of sin was injected into man's being
After accomplishing redemption through His death, Christ was resurrected from among the dead to release the divine life from within Him
As soon as a sinner responds to Him in this way, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into that one and through regeneration is born in him
Praise the Lord that this is the grace we find by approaching the throne of grace daily to meet our timely need
We shall experience grace, the grace who is the very Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit for our enjoyment
To nullify God's grace is to reject the processed Triune God who has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
We should go on to be one spirit with Christ , to walk in the Spirit , to deny the natural 'I' , and to abandon the flesh
If we walk in spirit, deny the natural 'I,' and abandon the flesh, we shall be those who do not nullify the grace of God
In 3:1 Paul says, 'O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified'?
If God wants us to keep the law and if we are able to keep it, then there was no need for Christ to be crucified
The cross is the center of God's operation in His economy, just as Christ Himself is the center of God's economy
Without Christ, God's economy has no center, and without the cross of Christ the operation of God's economy is without a center
In 3:1 he goes on to remind the Galatians that the crucifixion of Christ was openly portrayed before their eyes
Although Christ was crucified for our sins, the goal of His crucifixion was to 'rescue us out of the present evil age'
Even if the Galatians and the Judaizers could have been successful in keeping the law, how would they have dealt with the Devil, Satan?
Apart from the crucifixion of Christ we have no way to deal with sins behind which the Devil hides or the evil age behind which Satan hides
Dealing with these negative things opened the way for Christ to impart Himself into us as our life and thereby to live in us
The process through which Christ has passed affords Him the ground and the way to enter into us and to live in us in His resurrection life
In Galatians 3:13 Paul seemed to be telling the Galatians, 'The law is not good to you, for it has made the curse official
Galatians 2:21 says, 'I do not nullify the grace of God; for if righteousness is through law, then Christ has died for nothing'
Dying for our sins is related to redemption, whereas dying to become our righteousness is related to justification
Through His death we have been redeemed from our sins, and through His death we have also obtained righteousness in Him
Death in Adam is horrible, but the death of Christ is lovely and even lovable, for it accomplishes a great deal for us
Our crucifying the flesh with its passions and lusts is based upon the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ
The crucifixion of the old man had to be accomplished by someone else, but the crucifixion of the flesh must be carried out by us
Now we can see that if Christ had not been crucified, we would not have any basis or foundation for the crucifixion of our flesh
Since Christ has died on the cross, we can crucify our flesh, based on the fact that the old man has been crucified
With His crucifixion as the foundation, we are now able in Christ's resurrection life to crucify the flesh and deny the self
Through the cross Christ redeemed us from our sins, rescued us from the present evil age, and redeemed us from the curse of the law
Through Christ's crucifixion we now have the ground to crucify the flesh and the way to be separated from the world
Because the Galatians were endeavoring to keep the law, Paul considered them foolish and told them that they had been bewitched
As we read this important chapter, we should not take it for granted, assuming that we understand all the terms used by Paul
In this contrast we have two sets of opposites: the Spirit and the flesh as one set, and faith and law as another
In this central section of Galatians is presented the contrast between the Spirit and the flesh, and also the contrast between faith and law
It is correct to say that the subject of chapters three and four is the Spirit by faith versus the flesh by law
In verse 5 Paul asks whether the Galatian believers are supplied the Spirit by works of law or by the hearing of faith
Paul mentions the hearing of faith both with respect to receiving the Spirit and to God's supplying the Spirit
In contrast to the traditional teaching that the Spirit and Christ are separate and distinct the Bible tells us that the Spirit is in Christ
The principle is the same concerning the relationship of Christ and the Spirit as the relationship between Christ the Son and the Father
The fact that the Spirit of life is in Christ means that an intrinsic relationship exists among the Three of the Godhead
In these verses Paul says, 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
The Spirit of God is God, the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God, and Christ Himself is the Spirit of Christ
Christ is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is God Himself
In Romans 8:2 and 9 there are three titles of the Spirit: the Spirit is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Christ
In 3:1 Paul declares that before the eyes of the Galatian believers 'Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified'
In crucifixion for the believers' redemption He was Christ, but in the indwelling to be the believers' life He is the Spirit
He enters into the believers and lives in them, not by their keeping the law, but by their faith in the crucified and resurrected Christ
On the one hand, Galatians gives us a revelation of God's economy; on the other hand, it affords us a revelation of our experience of life
In the objective revelation of Gods economy the emphasis is on Christ but in the subjective experience of life the emphasis is on the Spirit
As believers, we have received the Spirit, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, as the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel
According to the understanding of many Christians the One they received when they believed in the Lord Jesus was only Christ the Son of God
Because many are not clear concerning this they talk about a socalled second blessing or about receiving the Spirit apart from regeneration
When some Christians learn that another has believed in Christ, they proceed to ask him if he has received the Holy Spirit
As we have pointed out again and again in this message, we simultaneously believe in Christ and receive the Spirit
When certain Christians are asked if they have received the Spirit, they are not clear or do not know how to answer
Because they are ignorant of the fact of such an organic union, they do not enjoy the Spirit as the ultimate blessing of the gospel
Of enjoying this blessing, they are distracted to regulations, doctrine, or to the study of the Bible in dead letters
Paul places strong emphasis on the sealing of the Spirit, the earnest of the Spirit, and the foretaste of the Spirit
In other words, when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received the Spirit, and the Spirit became to us the ultimate blessing of the gospel
By our experience we know that the supplying of the Spirit and the receiving of the Spirit take place continually
Both the supplying of the Spirit and the receiving of the Spirit are by the hearing of faith, not by the works of law
Law is related to the flesh and depends on the effort of the flesh, the very flesh that is the expression of 'I'
Faith is related to the Spirit, and trusts in the operation of the Spirit, the very Spirit who is the realization of Christ
To keep the law by the flesh is man's natural way; it is in the darkness of man's concept and results in death and wretchedness
To receive the Spirit by faith is God's revealed way; it is in the light of God's revelation and issues in life and glory
It is by the hearing of faith that we have received the Spirit that we may participate in God's promised blessing and live Christ
According to 3:23, 'before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed'
Theological terms such as the dispensation of law and the dispensation of grace are used to point out this distinction
According to this understanding, the Old Testament was the dispensation of law, whereas the New Testament is the dispensation of grace
If we would understand the meaning of the hearing of faith, we need to know what faith is and also what grace is
When people hear of the grace of God in the preaching of the gospel, something rises up within them to appreciate what they have heard
In 1:23 we are told that Paul, who once persecuted the believers in Christ, now preached 'the faith which formerly he ravaged'
The word we hear includes God, Christ, the Spirit, the cross, redemption, salvation, forgiveness, and eternal life
When the gospel is preached in a proper way, those who hear it will be stirred up and filled with appreciation
If our gospel preaching is cold, dull, and dead, it will be necessary to persuade people to pray and call on the Lord's name
They go on to receive, accept, join, partake of, and enjoy this grace, which is the Triune God processed to be everything to us
We can testify that it makes a great difference whether or not we come to the meetings for the hearing of faith
Those who speak in the church meetings should also be hearers, for they also hear the very things they are speaking
As we have pointed out again and again, this grace is the Triune God processed to become our enjoyment and everything to us
According to the revelation in the book of Galatians, God's New Testament economy is not that we strive in the flesh to keep the law
He is eagerly expecting to come into people and to be their life and their everything so that they may be one with Him
By receiving the Triune God we also receive redemption salvation forgiveness eternal life and all the heavenly divine and spiritual things
We have pointed out that Galatians 3 is a very difficult chapter, one of the most difficult chapters in the New Testament
In Christianity people are often told that being able to go to heaven and to live in a mansion is a great blessing related to the gospel
In the Bible, where words are always used economically, the Spirit has a particular meaning, somewhat different from the Holy Spirit
The total blessing of the gospel is not salvation, redemption, forgiveness, life, or going to heaven-it is the Spirit
The New Testament tells us clearly that the Holy Spirit was involved in the conception of the Lord Jesus in the womb of the virgin Mary
In Colossians 1:25 he says that he became a minister according to the stewardship of God to complete the word of God
In particular, the divine revelation is completed in four books: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians
The Spirit as revealed in Paul's writings is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy
If we read the book of Genesis, we shall see that the focal point of God's promise to Abraham was that Abraham's seed would inherit the land
Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 declares that now the Lord is the Spirit
The proper rendering is 'the Spirit,' referring to the Spirit who was 'not yet' until Christ had been glorified
At the time of the Lord's incarnation, the Holy Spirit began to have the element of humanity as well as divinity
In 1943 the church in my home town, Chefoo, was carried away from the proper inner life to the excesses of the Pentecostal things
We realized that this problem was related to the power of darkness and that the only way to deal with it was to pray
As the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the processed Triune God inspires His servants to preach the good word of the gospel
As people listen to this well-speaking, spontaneously an appreciation for the Lord Jesus is stirred up within them
Out of their appreciation they call on the Lord and thereby receive the Spirit as the full blessing of the gospel of God
No matter how we were brought to the Lord, we all have received the Spirit as the blessing of the gospel through the hearing faith
If we had not been frustrated by religion with its teachings, this organic union would have been fully developed by now
Today in His recovery the Lord is developing this organic union, and He will cause it to be developed to the uttermost
Because of the influence of our background in Christianity, our understanding of the terms Spirit and flesh in the New Testament is limited
In 3:3 Paul asks the Galatian believers, 'Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh'?
Those of us who have begun by the Spirit should be perfected by the Spirit and have nothing to do with the flesh
The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man, and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God
God's economy delivers us from the flesh to the Spirit that we may participate in the blessing of the riches of the Triune God
According to the revelation in the New Testament, the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God
The flesh refers to our entire fallen being, and the Spirit, to the entire Triune God, to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Having been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Triune God is today the Spirit
When we read of the flesh in the New Testament, we need to realize that it denotes the totality of man's fallen being
If we look at the book of Galatians from this point of view, we shall find that it is not difficult to understand
Satan utilizes the law given by God in order to distract God's people from His economy and to hinder the fulfillment of God's economy
When we take the way of faith to hear appreciate call upon receive accept join partake of and enjoy we spontaneously experience the Spirit
The way of faith causes the organic union between the processed God and regenerated man to be developed and cultivated
If this were the situation, surely the organic union between us and God would become highly developed in a short period of time
It has been frustrated not mainly by Judaism, Islam, or Buddhism, but by Catholicism, Protestantism, and Pentecostalism
The principle Satan follows in doing this is to take something given by God and to cause it to be used in a wrong way
After they were saved and became believers, they were kept from experiencing Christ by the very denominations through which they were saved
The greatest damage of Pentecostalism is that it makes it difficult for believers to appreciate the inward organic union with the Triune God
After one of the meetings, the leader of this group and his wife tried to get a particular Chinese brother to speak in tongues
Remembering a few words in the Malay language he happened to know, he uttered some nonsensical expression in that language
Immediately the leader of this Pentecostal group and his wife clapped their hands and rejoiced that this brother had spoken in tongues
The claim has even been made in some Pentecostal groups that in their meetings people's teeth have been filled with gold miraculously
Another case concerns the leader in a Pentecostal group who claimed that he had been given the ability to speak Chinese
The writer encouraged them all to go on speaking in tongues regardless of their doubts about the genuineness of what they were uttering
One elderly brother and three young people refused to go along with this situation, for they were clear concerning the truth
According to Paul's Epistles, the Triune God has been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
In the New Testament, however, we do not read of 'Thus saith the Lord'; instead we read of what Paul says or of what Peter and John say
In Galatians 3:16 Paul refers to God's word to Abraham as a promise: 'To Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed'
In message forty-one of the Life-study of Hebrews, we pointed out the difference between a covenant and a testament
A will is a testament which says that the testator has already done certain things or given certain things to particular people
It could only have been a covenant in which God promised to bless all the nations in Abraham and to give the good land to Abraham's seed
Paul boldly declares that the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham
The gospel was preached not only before the accomplishing of redemption by Christ, but also before the giving of the law through Moses
Paul's intention was to show that the law given through Moses was not God's original intention, but something secondary and additional
Because the law is not like Sarah, the genuine wife, but like Hagar, the concubine, it does not have the proper position
God promised Abraham that in him and because of him the nations, which had been brought under the curse, would be blessed
Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Him
The good land typifies the all-inclusive Christ realized by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit to be the blessing of the gospel
Since the Spirit in Galatians denotes the processed Triune God, we may say that the good land is the very processed Triune God
Vincent commenting on Matthew 2819 says that baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him
How could we have failed to receive the Spirit inasmuch as we have entered into an organic union with the Triune God?
There is no need for us to seek experiences such as speaking in tongues, for we can live by the Triune God in our spirit
In Taiwan we did not practice tongues-speaking, but within six years we increased from five hundred to twenty thousand
The Lord's recovery has spread to five continents, not through speaking in tongues, but through the organic union
The more hearing we have, the more appreciation there will be and also more calling, receiving, accepting, joining, partaking, and enjoying
In verse 11 Paul goes on to say, 'Now that by law no one is justified before God is evident, because, The just by faith shall live'
On the one hand, the fall of Adam brought in sin and sins; on the other hand, Adam's fall brought in the curse
The man created by God in His own image and according to His likeness became involved with sin and came under the curse
It is significant that the Bible does not say that the God of love appeared to Abraham, but says that the God of glory appeared to him
God came in, called Abraham, and promised that in him the nations, mankind in a state of division and confusion, would be blessed
In Genesis 15 the promise became a ratified covenant, and in Genesis 17 this covenant was confirmed by the sign of circumcision
At the time God was ratifying the promise in Genesis 15, making it a covenant, a great darkness came upon Abraham
The Bible records that Abraham's descendants went into Egypt and spent at least four hundred years under Egyptian tyranny
After the law with its ordinances was given to the people, God dealt with the children of Israel according to the law through the tabernacle
The people did not contact God through the law, but they contacted Him through the tabernacle with the priesthood and the offerings
Instead of having him cut off, God fulfilled His promise to Abraham to bless all nations by blessing such a sinner through the altar
After the people were exposed, they could turn to the tabernacle, the priesthood, the altar, and the offerings
The book of Exodus is not actually a book of law it is a book of the fulfillment of Gods promise a book of Christ the cross and the church
As we have pointed out, it was in the midst of a clear atmosphere that the pattern of the tabernacle was revealed to Moses
By means of the priesthood and the offerings those who were condemned under the law were able to have fellowship with God
Now we come to a fourth person, the most important of all-Jesus Christ, who came to fulfill God's promise to Abraham
The promise became not only a covenant, but also a testament, a will, for everything that had been promised was accomplished
The more we hear, the more our faith is strengthened, and the more our capacity to enjoy the blessing is enlarged
In the Bible there are six outstanding names or titles: Adam, Abraham, Moses, Christ, the church, and the New Jerusalem
God uses the law temporarily to expose His people, who do not have the proper knowledge of themselves and their condition
He also uses the law as a custodian to guard and keep the people and as an escort, a child conductor, to bring them to Christ
Once the law has fulfilled its function of bringing us to Christ, the law should not be allowed to stand in the way
Now in faith we are enjoying grace, which is the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit for our enjoyment
It was preached to him not only before the accomplishing of redemption by Christ, but also before the giving of the law through Moses
What God promised to Abraham corresponds to what God accomplished in Christ, which is the fulfillment of His promise to Abraham
The New Testament economy is a continuation of His dealing with Abraham and has nothing to do with the law of Moses
All the New Testament believers should be in this continuation and should have nothing to do with the law given through Moses
In dealing with the children of Israel according to the law God dealt with them through the tabernacle with the priesthood and the offerings
On the one hand, He dealt with them according to the law; on the other hand, He dealt with them through the tabernacle
In the Old Testament, an Israelite who had sinned was condemned by the law and required to bring a trespass offering
The law functioned as a custodian to bring the sinning Israelite to Christ, his Redeemer, typified by the trespass offering
On the other hand, the law has a positive position, that of a custodian to keep us and that of a child-conductor to bring us to Christ
We have pointed out that the law was the basic principle according to which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament
If it were not for the law, not many of the children of Israel would have come to the altar with a trespass offering
Because the law exposed them and condemned them, they realized their need to come to the altar with the required offering
Although God dealt with His people according to the law He did not deal with them through the law but dealt with them through the tabernacle
It was added while Gods economy was proceeding because of mans transgression until the seed Christ should come to whom Gods promise was made
Since it was added because of man's transgressions, it should have been deducted when those transgressions were taken away
In 3:23 Paul says, 'But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed'
In 3:24 Paul continues, 'So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith'
If we try to keep the law, we shall be in the flesh and automatically be under the curse, for the works of the law are under the curse
In Acts 6:7 we are told that many priests were obedient to the faith, and in 2 Timothy 4:7 Paul says that he kept the faith
In John 16:9 we are told that the Spirit will convict the world concerning sin because of not believing in the Son of God
It has both a divine aspect and a human aspect, for it implies something on God's side and something on our side
On our side, faith is related to hearing, appreciating, calling, receiving, accepting, joining, partaking, and enjoying
If we do not have faith, all that has been accomplished on God's side will remain objective and not be personally related to us
Faith brings us into the blessing God promised to Abraham, that is, to the all-inclusive land which typifies the all-inclusive Spirit
Finally, faith characterizes those who believe in Christ, and it distinguishes them from those who keep the law
According to both Darby's New Translation and the Chinese version, this expression denotes the principle of faith
Concerning promises made by one person to another, the one who fulfills the promise is seldom the one who enjoys the blessing of the promise
The fulfillment of this promise does not depend on the many sons of Abraham, but on the unique seed of Abraham
He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one, And to your seed, Who is Christ'
As we have pointed out, the One who fulfilled this promise is not the One who made the promise, but the promised One, the seed
In the same principle, in the fulfillment of the promise made by God to Abraham, we are not included as part of the unique seed
We, the New Testament believers, were born sons of fallen Adam, and in Adam, because of transgressions, we were under the law of Moses
As our faith photographed the divine scenery of grace, something of a real and substantial spiritual nature was infused into us
Just as a man's son partakes of his life and nature, so we as God's sons partake of the divine life and nature
It is correct to say that the believers are deified in the sense of possessing the divine life and the divine nature
We may use the word deification in a limited sense to convey the fact that we have been born of God to become sons of God
Praise the Lord that God is our Father and that we are the same as He with respect to the divine life and nature!
By both faith and baptism, we have been immersed into Christ, we have thus put on Christ, and we have become identified with Him
Although we all have a natural life with a natural ancestry, we need not live any longer according to that life
Under the New Testament, the believers as God's chosen people, being sons of full age, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ
Now that we have grace, faith, and the seed which has fulfilled the promise, we no longer need the law to serve as our custodian
We shall be included in Christ, the unique seed, to inherit the fulfilled promise and to enjoy the blessing of the promise to Abraham
We see that we are one in Christ with His resurrection life and His divine nature to be the one new man, as mentioned in Ephesians 2:15
In Romans 6:3 Paul says, 'Or are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
On the one hand, we have been baptized into Christ's person; on the other hand, we have been baptized into Christ's death
To baptize believers into the name of the Triune God means to baptize them into the very being, the Person, of the Triune God
The name denotes the Person, and the Person is the all-inclusive, processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit
The visible aspect is the expression the testimony of the invisible aspect whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect
The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb to terminate the old history of the one being baptized
We have pointed out that the Greek word rendered 'into' indicates union, as in Romans 6:3; Galatians 3:27; and 1 Corinthians 12:13
In chapter twelve, the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father
In chapter sixteen the Son is revealed by the Father to the disciples for the building of the church which is the lifepulse of the kingdom
Such a baptism into the reality of the Father, Son, and Spirit, according to Matthew, is for the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
By hearing such a message, their faith will be stirred up, and they will have a proper appreciation of baptism
If people hear a rich word on the meaning of baptism and have the hearing of faith, they will earnestly desire to be baptized
When a person is baptized into the Triune God, he enters into an organic union, which is able to transform his whole being
By means of our organic union with the Triune God, we are one with the Triune God, and the Triune God is one with us
How could we be baptized into Christ if, according to the traditional teaching of the Trinity, He were only sitting in the heavens?
What we are reflecting today is not the law; it is Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, the blessing of God's promise to Abraham
In order to experience this organic union with the Triune God, we need to believe into Christ and be baptized into Him
Vincent says that this Greek preposition, as used in Matthew 28:19, implies a mystical, spiritual union with the Triune God
If we have these three matters, God's eternal purpose will be fulfilled, and the desire of God's heart will be satisfied
Praise the Lord that we have entered into an organic union with Him and that now we are living Christ in the church, the one Body
In this message we shall consider 4:1-7, where we see that the Spirit of sonship replaces the custody of the law
We see that God's Son is versus man's religion , that Christ replaces law , and that the Spirit by faith is versus the flesh by law
If we have been properly enlightened by this book, we shall certainly choose the Spirit, who is the processed Triune God
In verse 3 Paul says, 'So also we, when we were children, were kept in slavery under the elements of the world'
The fullness of time in verse 4 denotes the completion of the Old Testament time, which occurred at the time appointed of the Father
Christ was born under law in order to redeem them from its custody that they might receive the sonship and become the sons of God
God's economy is to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God's promise, which was given for His eternal purpose
In 4:6 Paul declares, 'And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
As the sons of God, we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life
Although the law could keep us in ward, it could not give us the life, maturity, position, and right of sonship
Since the law could not produce the reality of sonship, you may be wondering why the Spirit was not sent forth earlier
Abraham appreciated this promise more than Adam would have appreciated it, had the promise been given to him immediately after the fall
On the one hand, the law exposed their corruption and helplessness; on the other hand, the law kept them until the coming of Christ
We have pointed out that the One who was crucified on the cross was Christ, but the One who enters into the believers is the Spirit
In crucifixion for our redemption, this One was Christ, but in the indwelling to be our life, He is the Spirit
After He had finished this work, He became, in resurrection, the life-giving Spirit and comes to us as the Spirit of the Son
Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father
For us to become sons of God not only involves our spirit, but also involves our heart as the center of our personality
The inner sense we have as we call on the Lord from our spirit through our heart is mainly in the heart, not in the spirit
How sweet it is when little children, enjoying a relationship in life with their fathers, say tenderly, 'Daddy'
Whereas the law could not give life, the Spirit gives life and brings us into maturity that we may have the full position and right of sons
These verses indicate that the Apostle Paul was in a difficult situation with respect to the believers in Galatia
Pauls burden was not to carry on a Christian work but was to minister Christ to the believers to labor that Christ might be formed in them
It is possible to work for the Lord and to help the saints, without having the burden to minister Christ to them
It is important for us to see that Paul's burden as expressed in these verses was altogether different from that of most Christian workers
To preach the gospel and raise up churches is one thing; to bear the burden to minister Christ into the saints is another
Paul points out that by turning again to the weak and poor elements of the law, the Galatian believers would once again become enslaved
Paul appeals to their love by reminding them that they had received him as a messenger of God, an angel, and had not despised his sickness
The Galatians formerly considered Paul's being retained in their place and preaching the gospel to them a blessing
We should not simply speak according to doctrinal truth, but should appeal to others in a personal, loving manner
Verse 17 says, 'They are zealous of you, not rightly, but they desire to shut you out, that you may be zealous of them'
The Judaizers were jealously courting the Galatians so that the Galatians might jealously court them in return
They wanted to exclude them from God's New Testament economy, from the enjoyment of Christ, and from the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
Their goal is to shut out the church people from the enjoyment of Christ and to cause the ones they have deceived to zealously follow them
By this word Paul indicates that he is not narrow, keeping other preachers of the gospel away from the Galatians
Paul was in favor of the proper preaching of others, but he was not in favor of that kind of jealous courting of the believers
Paul considers himself the begetting father, and the Galatian believers his children begotten of him in Christ
Because they had deviated from the gospel he preached to them, he labors again in travail until Christ is formed in them
Christ was born into us at our conversion, then He lives in us in our Christian life , and He will be formed in us at our maturity
If you would bear the burden, with a sincere heart, to minister Christ to others, you will discover what labor and suffering it requires
It is not adequate simply to say that we preach the gospel, for it is possible to preach the gospel without ministering Christ to others
We must learn from Paul to be burdened to minister Christ and also to appeal to the saints' affection that their hearts may be touched
The apostle wanted to change his tone from severity to affection, as a mother speaking lovingly to her children
He wanted to visit them and stay with them because he knew that his presence would accomplish more than his writing
On the one hand, he addressed them as 'foolish Galatians'; on the other hand, he appealed to them as 'beloved brothers'
There is a great need of affectionate contact with the saints; there is also the need to appeal to the affection of others
We must recognize that such an appeal is difficult, for it is easy for the natural love, the 'honey,' to be present
Otherwise, we might have the impression that in writing to the Galatians he was legal, but not personal or affectionate
In chapter four Paul could be affectionate and appeal to the love of the saints for the purpose of ministering Christ to them
The book of Galatians indicates that God's intention is for Christ to be wrought into His chosen people that they may become sons of God
In order to have Christ formed in us, we need to drop everything other than Christ Himself, no matter how good these things may be
Although the law was given by God, it must be set aside so that all the ground in our being may be given over to Christ
He should not only spread into our mind, emotion, and will; He should actually become our mind, emotion, and will
If Christ is not yet fully formed in us, then our enjoyment of the blessing of the New Testament is not yet full
He appealed to the believers' affection so that Christ might be formed in them for the fulfillment of God's goal
We have seen that in 4:8-20 Paul spoke in an affectionate manner and appealed to the personal feeling of the Galatians
In verses 22 and 23 Paul continues, 'For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one of the maidservant and one of the free woman
The child born of the maidservant was born according to the flesh, whereas the one born of the free woman was born according to grace
Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the Jerusalem which now is, for she is in slavery with her children'
According to Genesis 22:17, God promised that Abraham's descendants would be like the sand of the seashore and like the stars of heaven
The Jews are Abraham's descendants according to the flesh, whereas the believers in Christ are his descendants according to the Spirit
Verse 29 says, 'But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit, so also it is now'
The children of promise are born according to Spirit, God's Spirit of life, who is the very blessing of God's promise to Abraham
Today's Ishmaels, those according to flesh, are persecuting the real Isaacs, the children according to the Spirit
Cast out the maidservant and her son; for the son of the maidservant shall by no means inherit with the son of the free woman
The law brought forth children according to the flesh, but the promise and grace brought forth children according to the Spirit
He closes chapter four with these words: 'Wherefore, brothers, we are not children of a maidservant, but of the free woman'
With God's promise to Abraham there are two main aspects: the aspect of the nations being blessed and the aspect of the good land
When the Lord was with three of the disciples on the mount of transfiguration, the Father spoke the same words
As those who are children according to Spirit, we should lay aside the law, the flesh, slavery, and the children according to flesh
We should remain in the fulfillment of God's desire, enjoying grace, Christ, and the all-inclusive Spirit as the blessing of the gospel
Praise Him that we are children according to the Spirit enjoying the all-inclusive Spirit as the blessing of the gospel!
Although John 1 speaks of grace, in Galatians we see that grace is the fulfillment of God's promise according to the desire of His heart
If we did not have the book of Galatians, we would not know that the Spirit is Christ as the seed of Abraham to fulfill the promise
In fulfilling the promise, Christ is the seed; but for our enjoyment, He is the land, which typifies the all-inclusive Spirit
In this message we come to 5:1-6, which begins another major section of Galatians, concerned with the walk of God's children
After presenting the profound revelation found in chapters one through four Paul turns to the walk of Gods children according to the Spirit
In 5:1 Paul says, 'For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore and do not be again entangled with a yoke of slavery'
Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom and grace
To stand fast is to stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of law, not deviating from Christ, not falling from grace
Consider how often Paul speaks of faith in the book of Galatians, or how many times the New Testament refers to justification by faith
In 5:1 Paul writes in a redundant manner in order to impress us with the preciousness of our freedom in Christ
It seems Paul was saying to the Galatians, 'I want you to remember that it was for freedom that Christ has set us free
Since Christ has set us free for freedom, we should stand fast and not be entangled again with the yoke of slavery'
He was telling the Galatians, 'Dear saints, you who seek to be justified by law have been brought to nothing from Christ
If a branch from an inferior tree is grafted into a superior tree, it will enjoy all the benefits of being part of that superior tree
It reduces itself to nothing from the superior tree, in particular from the enjoyment of the riches of that tree
If we relinquish Christ, let Him go in a practical way in our experience, we shall be brought to nothing from the unsearchably rich Christ
It is difficult to find Christians today who, in some way or other, have not been brought to nought from Christ
Although they regard themselves as the most biblical of Christians, to some extent they also have been brought to nought from Christ
Those in today's Pentecostalism and charismatic movement have also been brought to nothing from Christ in certain ways
Where are the believers who have not been brought to nothing from Christ, who have not been deprived of their profit in Christ?
What a blessing it is to be able to testify that we daily enjoy the riches of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit!
In the same verse where Paul speaks of being brought to nought from Christ, he also speaks of having 'fallen from grace'
If the Galatian believers had received circumcision, making it a condition of salvation, Christ would have profited them nothing
In order to understand Paul's thought in 5:2-4, we need to know the background against which these verses were written
After fulfilling the promise, Christ became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is the very blessing of the promise
By enjoying this life-giving Spirit, we become children according to the Spirit, heirs of the promised blessing
If we go back to the law and circumcision, we shall be brought to nought from Christ, reduced to nothing from Christ
If we go back to the law, we shall detach ourselves from Christ as the superior tree and be brought to nothing from Him
In order to have the proper enjoyment, we need to have the Spirit as the all-inclusive land and faith as the means to enjoy this land
In 5:6 Paul goes on to say, 'For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith operating through love'
The Spirit is the all-inclusive land for our enjoyment, and faith is the organ by which we participate in this rich land and enjoy it
When we have the hearing of faith, this hearing awakens our loving appreciation, and this appreciation causes faith to operate
Of being brought to nought from Christ, we are strengthened with the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit
In the foregoing message we saw that Paul spoke to the Galatian believers about not being brought to nothing from Christ
Truth here does not refer to doctrine, but refers to the reality in Christ, as preached to the Galatians by Paul
Paul's word here is a strong indication that the Judaizers were one with Satan in acting against God's economy
Certain of the Galatian believers, however, may have considered the persuasive speech of the Judaizers as something rather small
In his subtle strategy, Satan uses the opposing ones and the dissenting ones to inject a little leaven through their persuasive speech
The negative points covered in the first four chapters of Galatians were not merely a little leaven, but a large amount of leaven
Because Paul had been praying for the Galatians, he could have confidence in the Lord concerning them and not be disappointed
As long as there is no idolatry, immorality, or divisiveness in the church, we should not be otherwise minded concerning anything
If none of the saints speak critically of this arrangement, this will be a sign that the church life is very strong
Whenever we visit another church, we should be content to be blind, not knowing anything about the situation of the saints there
The Judaizers endeavored to bring the Galatians back to the shadow; the Apostle Paul struggled to keep them in the reality
The Judaizers insisted on continuing the practice of circumcision, even though Christ had been crucified on the cross
Because the Judaizers insisted on circumcision and opposed the cross, they persecuted those, like Paul, who preached the cross of Christ
According to 5:11, Paul would not preach circumcision and thereby allow the stumbling block of the cross to be done away
To them, the cross of Christ was a stumbling block, and those who preached the word of the cross deserved to be persecuted
Paul was saying, 'Those who are disturbing you should not simply cut off a piece of flesh from their bodies-they should cut themselves off'
While Paul encouraged the believers to enjoy their freedom in Christ, he was also concerned that they might misuse or abuse this freedom
He realized that the Galatian believers who had been distracted might return to their freedom and then begin to misuse it
They might have the attitude that since they are no longer under any kind of yoke, they are free to do what they please
When some saints, especially young believers, hear a message on freedom, they have the tendency to cast off restraint
As Paul says in 5:14, 'The whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself'
We may enjoy the freedom we have and yet still be restricted in love for the sake of others that the church life may go on in a good way
According to the context of chapter five the Spirit in 516 must be the Holy Spirit who dwells in our regenerated spirit and mingles with it
We have indicated that in chapter five the Spirit refers to the Spirit indwelling our spirit and mingled with it
In 3:2 Paul asked the Galatians a question: 'Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith'?
Now after covering a number of important matters in chapters three and four, Paul charges them in 5:16 to walk by the Spirit
We cannot deny that we possess such a marvelous reality through Christ's redemption, the Spirit's regeneration, and God's dispensation
Concerning our walk, we thus have the possibility of walking either by the fallen being or by the wonderful Person in our spirit
If we try to keep the law, attempting to do good in order to please God, we shall be in the flesh, for the law is related to the flesh
Of trying to fulfill the law, we may walk by the processed Triune God who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit
In his Epistles, Paul does not charge us mainly to walk according to doctrine, nor even to walk according to certain Bible verses
It is not possible to separate our spirit from the Spirit, for the two spirits have been mingled and have become one spirit
We have already referred to Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 6:17, where he says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit
Even if your attitude toward your wife is good, as long as you are absent from the spirit, you are in the flesh
In Paul's word to the Colossians, he says that we need to 'persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving'
In Ephesians 6:18 Paul also speaks of 'praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance'
If we remain in our spirit, the problems will be solved, and we shall enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit who dwells in our spirit
In 5:16 Paul had the confidence to say that if we walk by the Spirit, we shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh
The way to be holy, to overcome sin, to be spiritual, and to have a life of prayer is simply to walk by the Spirit
Whenever we walk by the Spirit, we have the Lord's leading, even in such ordinary matters as the way we converse with others
The Spirit of life, not the law of letters, is our guiding principle, regulating our Christian walk in our regenerated spirit
If we walk by the Spirit, automatically we shall be no longer under the law, for the Spirit will lead us away from the law in letters
The flesh lusts against the Spirit for its own desire, and the Spirit fights against the flesh for God's purpose
Fornication, uncleanness, sensuality, drunkenness, and carousings are related to the lust of the corrupted body
The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers
Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in these verses will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward
The fruit of the Spirit, as different expressions of the Spirit who is life within us, is listed here with only nine items as illustrations
It has more items, including lowliness , compassion , godliness , righteousness , holiness , purity , and other virtues
Both in Ephesians 4:2 and Colossians 3:12 lowliness is mentioned as a virtue other than meekness, which is listed here
In Matthew 5:5-9 righteousness, mercy, and purity are reckoned with meekness and peace as the condition of the reality of the kingdom today
We have indicated that the fruit of the Spirit is full of life in contrast to the works of the flesh, which are without life
After listing nine aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, Paul declares that 'against such things there is no law'
The fact that Paul spoke of 'such things' indicates that there are many more aspects than the nine he uses as illustrations
It is necessary to differentiate between our natural virtues and those virtues which are the fruit of the Spirit
We also knew a certain amount of joy, peace, longsuffering, and kindness, as well as the other virtues listed here
Natural attributes do not contain anything of God, whereas the fruit of the Spirit is filled with a spiritual substance which is divine
The element of the Spirit must also be found in our joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control
When a person lives according to his natural attributes or virtues, there is no need for him to turn to the spirit
When we walk in the mingled Spirit, we live out Christ in different aspects, in all manner of spiritual attributes and virtues
The word 'but' in verse 22 contrasts the fruit of the Spirit in that verse with the works of the flesh in verse 19
The crucifixion of the old man in Romans 6:6 and the crucifixion of 'I' in Galatians 2:20 were not accomplished by us
For this practical experience, it is necessary that we through the Spirit execute the crucifixion which Christ has accomplished
The second fact, our crucifixion of the flesh, is the application of the first fact, Christ's crucifixion of the old man and the 'I'
Paul's use of the perfect tense to describe this indicates that such should be the normal experience of the believers
The book of Galatians unveils both that the law misused is versus Christ and that the flesh lusts against the Spirit
To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon the Spirit and regulated by the Spirit, not by the law
To walk by the Spirit is to have our practical living and acts in our daily life guided and ruled by the Spirit, not by the law
Because of the desire for vainglory, a brother may become envious if his wife receives praise that he does not receive
We can check whether or not we are walking by the Spirit by asking whether we have any vainglory, provoking, or envying
From his experience he knew what it meant to suffer from the same diseases that afflict us in our spiritual life today
When we test our living by the matters of vainglory, provoking, and envying, living by the Spirit becomes extremely practical
John 1:18 indicates this: 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
According to the book of Romans, it is not God's goal merely to have many people who have been justified and sanctified by faith
Romans 8:14 does not say that as many as are led by the Spirit are sanctified, spiritual, victorious, or will live in heavenly mansions
In verses 29 and 30 we see that those who are predestinated, called, justified, and glorified will be conformed to the image of God's Son
In these verses Paul indicates that we have been predestinated not simply to be sanctified, spiritual, and victorious
God has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that His Son 'should be the Firstborn among many brothers'
The first chapter of the Gospel of John says that the Word, who was in the beginning with God, became flesh and tabernacled among us
In the book of Galatians Paul emphasizes again and again that we are not lawkeepers or slaves under the law but we are sons of God in Christ
Praise the Lord that Christ came and accomplished redemption by dying on the cross that we may have the sonship!
The more we experience the Spirit in this way, the more we are not only transformed, but also conformed to the image of His Son
If Paul had stopped with verses 24 and 25, the matter of living by the Spirit and walking by the Spirit might have been very theoretical
Whether we are walking by the Spirit or by the flesh can be tested by the existence of vainglory, provoking, and envy
We may think that we are walking by the Spirit; however, feelings of vainglory and of envy prove that we are not
If we try to deal with provoking and envying without putting to death our vainglory, our efforts will be in vain
The husbands and wives may give in to one another, but if this giving in does not touch their vainglory, it is not genuine
In these verses he covers three things: how to restore one who has fallen, how to fulfill the law of Christ, and how to sow unto the Spirit
Apparently there is no connection between verse 3 and verse 2; actually there is a very real and significant connection
Perhaps you would say that certain ones who consider themselves to be something seem to bear the burdens of others
Even in the matter of sharing such things, we may fulfill the law of Christ, fulfilling the law of love according to the law of life
In verse 7 he warns, 'Do not be led astray, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he shall also reap'
To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires
Corruption is of the flesh, indicating that the flesh is corrupted; eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself
It is crucial for us to realize that the Christian walk must be a walk by the Spirit and a life of sowing to the Spirit
Of sowing to the flesh, we should sow to the Spirit, realizing that everything we say or do is part of our daily sowing
We may regard certain things as tiny-a little gossiping or a little criticizing-but they are seeds sown into others
Have you ever asked yourself how many seeds you have sown into others seeds that are not according to the Spirit but according to the flesh
Eventually after sowing to the flesh week by week month by month and year by year these coworkers and elders had to leave and go elsewhere
If an elder sows according to the Spirit, the longer he remains in a certain locality, the more he will reap of eternal life
If they minister according to the Spirit, sowing seeds of the Spirit, they will reap eternal life year after year
In the church life there are a number of elderly brothers and sisters who have been sowing unto the Spirit throughout the years
In 6:9 Paul goes on to say, 'And let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we shall reap if we do not faint'
In the same principle, what we sow unto the Spirit will usually grow more slowly than what we sow unto the flesh
In 610 Paul says So then as we have opportunity let us do good toward all men and especially toward those of the household of the faith
All believers in Christ are a universal household, the great family of God through faith in Christ, not through works of law
In these verses the main point is that we have been crucified to the religious world in order to live a new creation
For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh'
The Greek expression rendered good show in verse 12 means a good countenance hence a good appearance for making a good show a good display
The expression 'in the flesh' means outwardly in the sphere of the flesh, which is condemned and repudiated by God
Their circumcision was in mans natural and external being without the inward reality and spiritual value which are in our regenerated spirit
On the one hand, they wanted to make a display in their own flesh; on the other hand, they wanted to boast in the flesh of the Galatians
Circumcision, being a religious matter, indicates that the world in verse 14 must be mainly the religious world
On the one hand, the religious world was crucified to Paul; on the other hand, he was crucified to the religious world
The old creation is our old man in Adam , our natural being by birth, without God's life and the divine nature
The new creation spoken of in 6:15 is the old creation transformed by the divine life, by the processed Triune God
Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation
Although Paul tells us that we are justified by faith, the main point is not justification, but the new creation
When we were in the flesh, we were very much involved with the law and we were, of course, in the old creation
We should be able to say that the religious world has been crucified to us and that we have been crucified to the religious world
We should be able to testify that even if we tried to go back to that world, we would be rejected by it, for we have been crucified to it
In 6:16 Paul goes on to say, 'And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God'
In the foregoing message we considered Paul's word in 6:15: 'For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation'
It is rather strange that, at the end of this Epistle, Paul inserts a word about the brands of Jesus between the mention of peace and grace
In verse 16 he says, 'And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God'
Instead of following this immediately with a word about grace, Paul refers to bearing in his body the brands of Jesus
It is important to know the reason Paul inserted a word about the brands of Jesus between his mention of peace and grace
As he was writing about peace and grace, he had the realization within him that he enjoyed peace because he was bearing the brands of Jesus
After saying that peace should be on all those who walk by this rule, Paul asked that no one trouble him, for he bore the brands of Jesus
With Paul, a slave of Christ , physically the brands were the scars of his wounds received in his faithful service to his Master
Spiritually, they signify the characteristics of the life he lived, a life like that lived by the Lord Jesus when He was on this earth
Just as a slave might bear a brand mark testifying that he belonged to a certain owner, Paul bore in his body the brands of Jesus
It was as if the name of Christ had been branded upon him again and again as a testimony and declaration that Paul belonged to the Lord
As we have already indicated, the spiritual significance of the expression 'the brands of Jesus' is that Paul lived a crucified life
As one who lived in the fellowship of Jesus' sufferings, Paul bore the brands of Jesus as the sign that he lived a crucified life
Because he was persecuted, despised, ridiculed, rejected, and condemned, he could truly say that he bore the brands of Jesus
If you check with your experience, you will see that the more you are persecuted for following the Lord Jesus, the happier you are inwardly
According to Acts 5:40 and 41, the disciples rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus
The persecution Paul faced was a sign that he was in the center of God's economy and that he was one with the Lord Jesus, the persecuted One
After referring to the brands of Jesus, Paul says, 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is actually the bountiful supply, the all-inclusive enjoyment, of the life-giving Spirit
It is in this spirit of ours that we experience and enjoy the Spirit as the focal blessing of the New Testament
We need the grace of the Lord, which is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit, to be with our spirit
Christ the Spirit the new creation and our spirit are the four basic things revealed in this book as the underlying thought of Gods economy
On the negative side, the book of Galatians speaks of the law, the flesh, the 'I,' the religious world, slavery, and the curse
By the cross we are set free from the law the flesh and religion and we have Christ the Spirit the new creation and our regenerated spirit
Living the new creation, we bear the brands of Jesus and enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in our spirit
Although Paul had rebuked the Galatians and called them foolish , he had already used this intimate term to address them a number of times
Would it not be a great miracle for the life and nature of a human being to be imparted to a dog and to make that dog a man-dog?
Using the illustration of a dog receiving a human life, we see that the natural concept is merely that a dog can be cleansed and beautified
The highlight is that God has regenerated us, that He has actually imparted His life and nature into us to make us His sons
Certainly there is no greater wonder in the whole universe than that sinful men by being regenerated can become sons of God
Rather, it merely said that regeneration means that we have a new beginning and that all the old things have passed away
In regeneration, God as the life-giving Spirit comes into our spirit to regenerate us with His life and nature
Some talk about Christ's incarnation and human living with little realization of the significance of these things
The One who was born in a manger in Bethlehem and who was raised in a carpenter's home in Nazareth was the very God Himself in human form
When He came forth to carry out His ministry, He did not do so on a large scale, but on a small scale and even in a lowly way
When some Christians say that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, they consider that as the Son of God He is different from God
The effectiveness of Christ's wonderful death, the power of His resurrection, and the reality of His resurrection life are all in the Spirit
As the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Spirit includes the elements of incarnation, humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection
Not many Christians realize that they are sons of God and that God wants them to live the life of a son of God
Rather, by His salvation according to His economy, God has regenerated us by the divine life that we may be His sons and live as sons of God
After God regenerated us by His Spirit to make us His sons, He has been continually supplying to us the Spirit
There is no need to ask the Lord to make you patient, or to cause you to be a good wife and mother or husband and father
If you give the Lord this opportunity, receiving the transmission of the Spirit, you will automatically be a good wife or husband
If you stay open to the Spirit and receive the Spirit constantly, you will be surprised how this will affect your daily living
If we would receive the supply of heavenly electricity, all we need to do is go to the 'switch,' our regenerated spirit, and 'switch on'
You may pray again and again for the Lord to make you patient or loving, but you may not receive anything of the Spirit
Verse 6 says, 'And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
At the other extreme are certain Pentecostal people who emphasize the Spirit, but in a way that is not proper or in line with God's economy
In order to stay open to the Lord, it is helpful to call on His name, to pray-read, to praise the Lord, and to sing to the Lord
Realizing that we have been born of the Spirit, we should now stay open to receive the Spirit moment by moment
The most crucial and mysterious matter revealed in the Bible is that God's ultimate intention is to work Himself into His chosen people
On the one hand, it is indeed a mystery; on the other hand, it is a mystery that has been revealed in the Bible
Most readers of the Bible have paid their attention to many things other than this crucial and mysterious point in the divine revelation
Eventually, this incarnate Word was crucified, and after His resurrection He, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit
Concerning the Bible and its interpretation, there has been division, whereas concerning the Spirit there has been confusion
Some are actually frightened by any mention of the Spirit, regarding the Spirit as something too mysterious to talk about
If to us God is only on the throne in heaven as the object of our worship, how can He be our life and how can He be wrought into our being?
According to the New Testament, especially Paul's Epistles, the Spirit we are receiving is the processed Triune God
Some find fault with the word 'processed' and argue that it is impossible for God to be processed because He is eternal and unchanging
A certain preposition used in the Gospel of John indicates that the Son comes not only from the Father, but from with the Father
Just as the Father came with the Son when the Son came from with the Father, so the Spirit comes with the Father and the Son
Many Christians today have stopped their spiritual breathing; therefore, their spiritual life has come to a standstill
If we pray with the words of John 1:1, we shall receive the Spirit, for in our experience the Word will become spirit
In such a case the brother is helped in a doctrinal way to become religious, but he is not helped to receive the Spirit
The proper way to help one who has been suffering from mistreatment is to encourage him to open to the Lord and contact Him
We need the life-giving Spirit to flow into us to kill the negative things, the 'germs,' and to supply us with life
Of trying to submit or to love, a husband and wife should simply contact the Lord directly, exercising their spirit to call on His name
Day by day and even moment by moment, we should be open to the Spirit and exercise our spirit by calling on the Lord to receive the Spirit
Those who have been in the Lord's recovery for a number of years have learned the doctrines and teachings of the recovery
As this element spreads within us, we shall grow and be transformed, and the negative things in us will be eliminated
May all the saints in the Lord's recovery turn from receiving mere doctrine and knowledge to receiving the Spirit
Regeneration by which we are born of God to become His sons is accomplished by God Himself as the life-giving Spirit
Not only have we been saved and redeemed; we are even one spirit with the Lord and, as a result, we have the divine life and nature
We all need to humble ourselves before the Lord and pray, 'Lord, show us the vision that we are one spirit with You
Although the Lord has come into our spirit and dwells in our spirit, much of the time we ourselves are not in the spirit
On many occasions we leave the Lord in our spirit and go off to spend time in the chambers of our mind or emotion
The Lord is never willing to give us such a leave of absence, no matter how we may try to bargain with Him about it
They may think that the Lord will be with them if they go to the church meetings, but not if they go to a movie
If you were to attend a movie, the Lord's presence is apt to be more obvious to you than when you are in a meeting
Contrary to your expectation, you may discover that while you are there, the Lord manifests His presence to you more than ever
As long as a person has been saved and regenerated he has not only received the Holy Spirit but he has even become one spirit with the Lord
We have the ground to testify boldly that, as saved and regenerated ones, we are now one spirit with the Triune God
In 3:2 Paul asks the Galatian believers, 'Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith'?
Paul's questions indicate that the Galatians had received the Spirit and that God was continuing to supply the Spirit to them
Whenever we exercise our spirit to call on the Lord, we experience the divine transmission, the flow of the heavenly current
You may learn a particular matter, for example, addition or subtraction, once for all, but you do not breathe, eat, or drink once for all
You may graduate from school, but you cannot graduate from breathing, drinking, and eating and still remain alive
Paul's word about living in 5:25 is not limited to our initial experience at regeneration, but applies to our daily living
If we would receive the Spirit in this way, we need to open ourselves, exercise our spirit, and call on the Lord
The husband may point out the shortcomings of the wife, and the wife may respond by pointing out the shortcomings of her husband
Earlier in the day, they may have exercised their spirit to contact the Lord and to receive the Spirit by breathing Him in
Since a husband and wife exercise their spirit to receive the Spirit, they should also walk by the Spirit in their married life
When we live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit, God is spontaneously lived out of us and is expressed through us
Instead of acting in ourselves and walking by the flesh, we shall do everything by the Spirit whom we receive by breathing
Paul's burden in writing to the distracted Galatian believers was to bring them back to such a walk by the Spirit
Husbands will have no lack of love for their wives, and the wives will not be short of submission to their husbands
Sometimes, when they were on the way to a department store, they had the sense from the Spirit to go back home
Others can testify that because they were walking by the Spirit, they could lay aside their choice in certain matters
Walking by the Spirit is the way to grow, enjoy the Lord, and develop the proper functions for the building up of the Body
Because the Judaizers were misusing the law, the Epistle to the Galatians was written to reveal Christ as the replacement of the law
The crucial points in chapters one and two are that the Son of God has been revealed into us and that we should live Him
In a somewhat rebuking tone, he goes on to ask in the next verse, 'Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh'?
The Spirit in chapter three is the very realization of the Christ in chapter two, and the flesh is the experiential aspect of the 'I'
Galatians 4:29 says, 'But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit, so also it is now'
On the one hand, we are children born according to flesh; on the other hand, we are also children born according to Spirit
Finally in chapter six we have the contrast between two different kinds of sowing the sowing unto the flesh and the sowing unto the Spirit
Even a word uttered by us contains seeds that will land in a particular soil, grow, and produce a harvest which we shall reap
Unsaved people do not realize that their life of sowing will eventually cause them to reap death and the lake of fire
We should not be surprised that we reap a certain thing, for that kind of reaping comes from that particular kind of sowing
Although it is dangerous to gather information about others, some saints in the church could even be called an information center
If we sow unto the flesh, we shall of the flesh reap corruption, but if we sow unto the Spirit, we shall reap of the Spirit eternal life
Gossiping criticizing shopping in a worldly way reading the newspaper apart from the control of the Spiritall these are aspects of the flesh
The way we dress, how we arrange things in our room, where we go, even what we eat-all will be a sowing unto the Spirit
The way we talk to others, the way we spend our money, and every aspect of our living should be with a view to this goal
In 610 Paul says So then as we have opportunity let us do good toward all men and especially toward those of the household of the faith
If we receive grace from the Lord to live Christ, we shall sow unto the Spirit and take the Spirit as our goal
Because we have been sowing unto the Spirit, even those who contact us only indirectly will receive something of life
Paul's concept was that those who were trying to keep the law and were practicing circumcision were sowing unto the flesh
For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh'
Paul's use of the word flesh in these verses affords us a key to understanding what it means to sow unto the flesh
By seeking to make such a display in the flesh, the Judaizers were sowing unto their flesh, and the result was sure to be corruption
The Greek term for corruption does not mainly denote rottenness; on the contrary, the primary significance of this term is destruction
Those who were sowing unto the flesh by practicing circumcision were an offense to God, and God came in to destroy their religious system
By maintaining this practice in order to make a fair show in the flesh the Judaizers were rebelling against Gods governmental administration
It is a matter of utmost seriousness to insist on law-keeping and circumcision when God has made a change in His economy
The New Jerusalem, the ultimate embodiment of eternal life, will be the consummate issue of our sowing unto the Spirit
In verse 15 Paul went on to say, 'For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation'
As we have already pointed out elsewhere, the world in verse 14 is primarily the religious world, as indicated by verse 15
We have seen that the phrase 'unto the Spirit' means to aim at the Spirit and to take the Spirit as the goal of our living
Their aim in life was to carry out the law, circumcision, the ordinances, the regulations, and the keeping of the Sabbath
Paul knew that the Galatian believers were mistaken in aiming at the law and circumcision, which God had repudiated
He wanted them to come back to the life-giving Spirit, the One who is the totality of the blessing of the gospel
Something infinitely better than the world-the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit-has taken full possession of us
Believers are delivered from loving the world not by teaching, but by loving the Triune God and being filled with Him
The meaning of the new creation is that God, the divine Spirit, mingles Himself with us and constitutes us with Himself to make us new
As a result, we no longer remain the old creation but become a new creation with a divine element wrought into us
Today the church people in the Lord's recovery are undergoing the process of becoming reconstituted of the divine element
In 6:16 Paul says, 'And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God'
Paul ends the book of Galatians in this way: 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers
At the beginning of this Epistle, Paul said, 'Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ'
In 6:16 Paul says, 'And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God'
In other words, all who live the new creation by sowing unto the Spirit are the true Israel of God, and peace is upon them
Peace rains upon the real Israel of God, upon those who walk by the rule of living a new creation by sowing unto the Spirit
Why at the beginning of Galatians does Paul mention grace before peace and at the ending speak of peace before grace?
In 6:1 he says, 'Brothers, if ever a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness'
If we do not know our human spirit which has been regenerated by the Holy Spirit we have no way to enjoy Christ as the allinclusive Spirit
The heavenly 'electricity' has been installed in us, and our human spirit is the 'switch' by which we may apply it
The point here is that we have a faculty within us in addition to the mind, emotion, and will, and this faculty is the spirit
When the light of the truth was allowed to shine through our mind into our conscience, our conscience caused us to repent
When we prayed in this way, exercising faith in the Lord, the Spirit of God came into our spirit and regenerated it
Putting these verses together, we see that the grace in John 1 is the very Spirit, the holy breath, in John 7 and 20
Whenever we are short of the experience of the Spirit moving in us and anointing us, we do not have the enjoyment of grace
If we would receive grace and enjoy grace, we need to realize that our spirit is the only place we can experience grace
Just as electricity can be applied only by turning on the switch, so we can contact the moving, anointing Spirit only in our spirit
Whenever we approach the throne of grace by turning to our spirit and calling on the name of the Lord, we should enthrone the Lord
Sometimes as we are praying we sense that the Lord is within us, but we are not willing to give Him the throne
At the very time we are praying, we need to allow the Lord to be on the throne within us, honoring Him as the Head, the Lord, and the King
In Revelation 22:1 and 2 we see that the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb
Many of us can testify that whenever we fail to enthrone the Lord, we do not receive much grace in our times of prayer
If we would receive grace and enjoy grace, the first thing we must do is turn to our spirit and forget our mind, emotion, and will
As they are exchanging words, they will find it difficult to turn to the spirit, for their reasonings and their emotion have been stirred up
During this time, the only thing you should do is exercise yourself to turn to the spirit and stay in the spirit
When we turn to the spirit and stay there, we need to recognize the Lord as the Head and the King and enthrone Him
We need to respect His position, honor His authority, and confess that we have no right to say or do anything on our own
We shall realize in our experience that on the one hand the Holy of Holies is in heaven and that on the other hand it is also in our spirit
If we enthrone the Lord Jesus within us, the Spirit as the water of life will flow from the throne to supply us
As we consider the two kinds of walk by the Spirit, we shall refer to the walk in 5:16 as the first kind and to that in 5:25 as the second
The Greek word for walk in verse 16, peripateo, means to have our being, to deport ourselves, to order our manner of life, to walk about
The various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in these verses are not unusual things; they are aspects of our ordinary daily life
In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about
In Romans 4:12 Paul speaks of those 'who walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision'
The walk in Romans 4:12 is not a common, ordinary walk; it is a definite, particular walk, the walk in the steps of Abraham's faith
In Philippians 3:16 Paul also speaks of the second kind of walk: 'Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk'
Paul's use of two different Greek words for walk indicates clearly that there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit in the New Testament
In the Old Testament we are told many times that the Spirit of the Lord, or of Jehovah, came upon certain people
When the Lord Jesus was about to be conceived in the womb of Mary, we are told that the Holy Spirit would come upon her
After the resurrection of the Lord Jesus the Spirit of God the Spirit of Jehovah the Holy Spirit is now the Spirit the allinclusive Spirit
Now the Spirit includes divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the power of His resurrection
In verse 23 the Lord Jesus said that He and the Father would come to make an abode with the one who loves the Lord and keeps His word
From our experience we know that this Spirit, the compound, all-inclusive Spirit, is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
Some Christians object to the expression 'processed God,' with the argument that God is eternal and never changes
The word Trinity cannot be found in the Bible either, but the Bible nevertheless reveals the fact that God is triune
In the same principle, although the Bible does not have the term 'processed,' it does reveal the fact that God has passed through a process
In the book of Galatians Paul asks the believers in Galatia if they received the Spirit by works of law or by the hearing of faith
In his Epistles Paul charges us not to walk by a particular doctrine or instruction, but to walk by the Spirit
Recently the Lord has shown that He does not want us simply to live in His presence, but to live Christ by being one spirit with the Lord
The first kind of walk by the Spirit, that mentioned by Paul in Galatians 5:16, is the walk in which we are one spirit with the Lord
We may apply this word to ourselves and realize that as we go to a particular place, the Lord's presence will go with us
Some Christians have gone so far as to say that it is blasphemy to claim that we can be one spirit with the Lord
Although we may read this word, we may have no response to it, because we are veiled by religious, natural, and traditional concepts
Recently the Lord has brought us to the point where we simply must pay attention to the New Testament requirement to be one spirit with Him
According to God's New Testament economy, the Lord desires to come into us, to become one with us, and to make us one with Him
The more we are one spirit with Him in our daily living, the more we shall enjoy salvation, sanctification, and transformation
In this message we shall consider in more detail the second walk, the walk in the divine rules and steps by the Spirit
We must have the second kind of walk, a walk to fulfill God's purpose and to reach the goal of our life on earth
In such a case he would not have the first walk as a support for the second walk toward the goal of graduation
They do not have a life of prayer, they do not read the Bible regularly, and they do not contact the Lord consistently
They may not steal or lie; however, even though they are good, honest, and faithful, they do not walk by the Spirit
In order for us to have a proper living as children of God, we need to have the first kind of walk by the Spirit
We may find that as we are taking care of practical matters, we have thirty minutes to call on the name of the Lord Jesus
To be sure, this walk is not the first kind of walk by the Spirit; it is the second kind of walk, the walk in line to reach God's goal
Paul also uses this word in 6:16: 'And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God'
Paul's intention in writing to the Galatians was to tell them that they should no longer take the law as their rule
According to 5:25, since we have received life and live by the Spirit, we should now have the second walk by the Spirit as our rule
In 6:16 Paul says, 'And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God'
To say that the new creation is the rule by which we must walk does not mean that it is a different highway from the Spirit as our rule
In Philippians 3:14 he said, 'I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus'
The second walk is by the Spirit, by the new creation, by pursuing and gaining Christ, and by practicing the church life
Because they do not have the second kind of walk by the Spirit, they are not able to fulfill God's purpose or reach His goal
A proper daily walk by the Spirit will qualify us and equip us for the second walk by the Spirit, the walk which accomplishes God's purpose
If we have the first walk by the Spirit but not the second, we may be regarded by others as 'holy,' 'spiritual,' or 'victorious'
We need to have a proper daily living to qualify us, equip us, and empower us for the second walk to reach God's goal
As we practice the second kind of walk by the Spirit, we need to care also for the new creation, the gaining of Christ, and the church life
We shall reach God's goal and receive the glorious prize of the full enjoyment of Christ and experience of Christ
Colossians and Galatians are two books in the New Testament which reveal that Christ is life and everything to us
Colossians deals with culture, and Galatians, with the law given through Moses and the religion formed according to this law
God's ultimate intention in the universe is to dispense Himself into His people that they may have one life and one living with Him
In chapter one we see that the Son of God is versus the very religion formed and established according to the law given by God
The dear Son of God who has been revealed in us and who is now one with us is versus religion with all its traditions
Their experience on the mount of transfiguration illustrates what Paul is saying in the first chapter of Galatians
While the Lord Jesus was talking with the Samaritan woman, the priests in Jerusalem were worshipping God in the temple
To answer this question properly we need to realize that the One who spoke to the Samaritan woman beside the well was actually God Himself
If you had been there, would you have been worshipping God with the priests in the temple or with the Samaritan woman by the well?
If we are honest, we must admit that we probably would have been with the priests worshipping according to tradition
We need to see from Galatians 1 that tradition must be set aside and that only the Son of God should be revealed in us
In verse 2 he inquires of the Galatian believers, 'Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith'?
To say that we have received the divine life and nature does not mean that we shall ever be deified or worshipped as God Himself
In this message we shall deal with these two walks together and consider walking by the Spirit as the path for our way
The Triune God has passed through incarnation human living crucifixion and resurrection to become the processed compound Spirit living in us
Because we were constituted of the element of the flesh, the flesh was the essence of our life, our constitution
From that time onward it has been possible for us to live either by the essence of the flesh or by the essence of the Spirit
In Galatians 5 Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit, that is, to take the Spirit as our essence and constituent
If we take the Spirit as our essence and crucify the flesh, every aspect of our daily walk will be by the Spirit
If you live by the Spirit as your essence, you should also take the Spirit as your pathway to reach God's goal
Our only reason for doing things or for not doing things should be that we take the Spirit as our essence and thereby live Christ
We shall walk according to the Spirit, not according to doctrine, theology, religion, tradition, or organization
Walking by the Spirit as our way, we shall be able to reach the goal and gain the prize, which is Christ Himself
The book of Galatians indicates that we should not live by the law, religion, tradition, organization, doctrines, or regulations
In the book of Galatians God's two economies, His Old Testament economy and His New Testament economy, are dealt with in a full way
The word for God's economy in the Old Testament is law, and the word for His economy in the New Testament is Christ
In contrast to the Jews, who love the law, we who believe in Christ would all say that we prefer Christ to the law
Although they may not realize it, there is some kind of law hidden within them, like a cancer growing on a person's vital inward organs
Suppose, for example, that a sister is subject to many irritations, but she does not become angry and lose her temper
Is it because she is living according to Christ, or because she is walking according to certain rules and regulations?
Let us suppose, as another example, that whenever a certain brother is tempted to tell a lie, he exercises himself to speak the truth
Our attitude may be that the Lord may sit on the throne in heaven, but we do not need Him to help us live on earth
You can say truly that you love the Lord and seek Him, but can you honestly say that you live Christ day by day?
His first economy, the economy in the Old Testament, involves law, our ethical laws as well as the God-given law
Whenever a person is regenerated, he continues to live according to the ethical laws he has assimilated from his culture
Even though we may seek Christ we still live our own cultural laws and thereby in our actual experience keep ourselves in Gods first economy
Zealous was he for the Jewish religion that he resolved to persecute all those who were living in God's second economy
Paul experienced a genuine conversion, a real turn from God's old economy of the law to His new economy of Christ
In 3:2 Paul asks the Galatian believers, 'Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith'?
According to the traditional theology of the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate Persons
The fact that the Spirit comes whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus indicates that Christ and the Spirit are one
Galatians 1 and 2 are concerned with revelation and speak of the Son of God revealed in us and Christ living in us
Paul does not say that God supplied the Spirit or that He shall supply the Spirit; he says that God is supplying the Spirit
On the one hand, Christ has been revealed in us and is now living in us; on the other hand, Christ has been put upon us
Because we have been joined to the Spirit organically, there is now no way to separate the Spirit from our spirit
Praise the Lord that the Spirit of sonship has entered into us and that we have been born of the Spirit to become sons of God!
For Christ to be formed in us requires that we forget our self-made laws and allow Christ to occupy us in full
To walk by the Spirit here actually means to live Christ, to move, act, and have our being according to the indwelling Spirit
If we are calm or excited, the reason for our calmness or excitement should simply be that we are living according to the Spirit
His use of the expression 'such things' indicates that the fruit of the Spirit is not limited to the items mentioned in verses 22 and 23
The sisters need to dress according to the Spirit, not according to a certain way practiced in the local churches
To conform to a certain way of dressing common to those in the local churches may be a very good habit or practice, but it is not life
To walk by the Spirit and thereby to have every aspect of our daily walk in correspondence to the Spirit is altogether a matter of life
What God wants is not that we conform to certain customs and habits, even though such conformity may be very good in human eyes
Our daily life as Christians should be a life of walking by the Spirit to live Christ by expressing Him with all His excellent virtues
According to His New Testament economy, God's intention is to dispense Christ into us and to make Christ one with us and us one with Him
We may pay our attention to such things as Paul's commandment for husbands to love their wives, or for wives to submit to their husbands
The Greek word is stoicheo, the verbal form of the Greek word for element used in 4:3 and 9, and Colossians 2:8
If we say, 'If we live by the Spirit, let us also element by the Spirit,' no one will be able to understand what we mean
It is not to walk in a general way in the sense of walking about but to walk in a specific way according to a certain rule principle or lane
For God's purpose, we need to have a walk that is orderly, a walk that is according to certain elementary rules or basic principles
We may use the daily life of a young sister who is a student to illustrate the two kinds of walk by the Spirit
On the other hand, she needs to be a proper student at school and fulfill all the requirements leading to graduation
In the first three chapters of Galatians we see that Christ is revealed in us that Christ lives in us and that Christ has been put upon us
We are all 'sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus' , and the Spirit of the Son of God has been sent into our hearts
If we have the second kind of walk by the Spirit, we shall be not only sons of God, but also a new creation and the Israel of God
In chapter five we see that we need two kinds of walk by the Spirit, a general walk to express Christ and a purposeful walk toward the goal
According to 6:13, they wanted the Galatian believers to be circumcised so that they could boast in the flesh of the Galatians
Only when God's element is added to His creation and mingled with it does that creation become the new creation
Because God the heavenly tea has been added to us we are no longer the plain water of the old creation but the teawater of the new creation
If we as Christians live merely according to the law or according to ethical standards, we shall live without God
If we are enlightened, we shall see that as Christians we must walk by the basic principle of the new creation
How much different is a sisters submission when she lives according to the basic principle of the new creation the mingling of God with man!
In the case of submission in the old creation, the sister walks according to certain principles or rules assimilated from her culture
In the case of submission in the new creation, the sister walks according to the basic principle of the new creation
Walking by the principle of the new creation is mysterious because this is an organic matter altogether related to life
In this walk by the principle of the new creation, we experience Christ much more than in the first kind of walk
They may find it difficult to designate this mysterious element, for it is actually the wonderful Person of Christ living in us
According to the book of Genesis, Jacob, a heel-holder, a supplanter, was transformed into Israel, a prince of God and a victor
In 6:16 Paul says, 'And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God'
In order for peace to be upon us, we need to be those who walk by the rule of the new creation to be the true Israel of God
The walk in 516 is a more general walk whereas the walk in 525 and 616 is a particular walk a walk according to a certain rule or principle
As one with a dual status-that of a son in the royal family and that of a king-to-be-he must have two kinds of living
To be proper sons of God it is sufficient to have the fruit of the Spirit, such as those virtues listed in 5:22 and 23
We thank the Lord that, by His mercy, many in the church life today do have the first kind of walk by the Spirit to live Christ
In a sense, the nation of Israel is the Israel of God and a testimony of God, even though many Israelites are rebellious and very sinful
Because both the nation of Israel and the church are in a low condition, there is the need for the Lord to recover the real Israel of God
Because they do not walk according to the principle of the new creation, it is not possible for them to become the Israel of God
The expression 'the new creation' denotes the nature, the inward and intrinsic organic constituent, of the church
Paul says that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, neither being religious nor unreligious, avails anything, but only a new creation
To walk according to the basic principle of the new creation is to walk in a regulated way like soldiers marching in cadence
The reason the so-called church is weak is that the believers do not have the second kind of walk by the Spirit
Praise the Lord that in God's New Testament economy we have been made both the sons of God and the Israel of God!
For this reason, whenever they see the word spirit in the New Testament, they assume that it refers to the Holy Spirit
In this enjoyment and by this enjoyment we may walk by the Spirit to live Christ and to live the new creation and the Israel of God
Just as we cannot stay alive if we 'graduate' from breathing, so we cannot live spiritually if we stop calling on the name of the Lord
Many learned ones do not care for such a simple practice, preferring instead to do things that are much more complicated
Calling on the Lord has nothing to do with chanting, for calling is a practice altogether according to the Bible
Oh, how we need to call on the Lord Jesus that we may enjoy Him as our grace and have the two kinds of walk by the Spirit!
If we read Romans carefully, we shall see that justification by faith is covered for the most part in the first four chapters
For the accomplishment of redemption, it was necessary for the Son of God to become a human being born of a woman and born under the law
After the Son of God accomplished redemption for us the Spirit was sent to carry out the sonship and to make it real to us in our experience
The expression 'the Spirit' is also found in verse 16: 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God'
Although the Spirit of God the Spirit of Jehovah and the Holy Spirit were in existence before the glorification of Christ the Spirit was not
When Jesus cried out, saying, 'If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink' , He spoke concerning the Spirit
Under the influence of the natural concept, Christians often think that after we are saved, we should have a walk which glorifies God
According to the natural concept, to walk worthy of our calling is to be honest, faithful, humble, gentle, kind, and loving
His purpose is not to make sinful husbands into those who love their wives, or sinful wives into those who submit to their husbands
We can declare with assurance that we are not God's sons-in-law, nor merely His adopted sons; we are God's sons in life, sons born of Him
Since you have been born of God to become a son of God, do you have the boldness to declare that you are divine?
As a human being has the life and nature of his father, so we, God's sons, have the life and nature of our Father
The Bible reveals the organic union between the believers and the Triune God, but religion emphasizes virtues and good behavior
One person may be humble in a natural way, whereas another may be humble because he is living by the life and nature of God
If we walk according to the Spirit, we shall not be like polished copper; we shall have the appearance of gold, of the very nature of God
To walk as a son of God is not a matter of possessing certain virtues; it is altogether a matter of walking according to spirit
We may have the knowledge that we simply need to walk by the Spirit, but in our daily living we may live in a natural, ethical way
Suppose the Lord makes you clear that as a son of God what you need to do is simply walk according to the Spirit
Verse 14 says that as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God, and verse 15 speaks of a spirit of sonship
Verse 29 says that God has predestinated us to be 'conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the firstborn among many brothers'
In the Lord's recovery the main thing the Lord wants us to practice is to walk by the Spirit and according to the Spirit
Some saints may undergo a good deal of change, but this change may not be the real transformation, a metabolic change in life
It may merely be an outward change of conforming to certain ways of living common among the saints in the church life
He wants to see a real transformation take place inwardly in our being so that we may be conformed to the living image of the Son of God
In order for this kind of change to take place, we need to walk in the Spirit, by the Spirit, and according to the Spirit
After Christ accomplished redemption for us, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father'!
These books do not charge us to walk according to certain doctrines, teachings, or exhortations, but to walk according to the Spirit
When we walk according to the Spirit, we are sons of God in actuality, and we are being conformed daily to the image of His Son
It is rather easy for us, the children of God, to know God's salvation, but not so easy to know the economy of God's salvation
Although the word economy cannot be found in either Romans or Galatians, God's economy in His salvation is nonetheless implied
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
For God to have millions of sons means that He, a great Father, needs a vast, universal, and eternal expression
God's economy, His administration, is to carry out His purpose to have many sons to be His corporate expression
According to the Bible, sonship involves having the life and nature of the Father to express Him and inherit all that He is, has, and does
Sonship in the Bible means to have God's life and nature to express God and to inherit God with all His riches
A small boy is the genuine son of his father, but this boy does not yet have the full sonship, because he is not mature
One day our body will be changed, not simply outwardly, but organically and metabolically by having the divine element wrought into it
When we see Him, He will be shining with the glory of the Father, and we shall be shining with this glory also
Adam in Genesis 1 had the image of God and the likeness of God, but he did not have the life and nature of God
God sent His Son to be a man with blood and flesh to accomplish redemption and to bring fallen man back to God's original purpose
According to Genesis 1:26, God created man in His image and after His likeness, but He did not beget man with the divine life at that time
After Christ came to accomplish redemption and we believed in Him, His blood made it possible for the divine life to be imparted into us
Now we can declare boldly that we not only have the image and likeness of God outwardly but that we have the life and nature of God inwardly
Now we must come to a crucial point and ask an important question Since we are sons of God should we live as Gods creatures or as Gods sons
As children of God, we have been born 'not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God'
The teaching regarding submission found in the classical writings of Confucius only helps us to live as creatures of God
In one of his writings called The Highest Learning, Confucius speaks of developing and cultivating the 'bright virtue'
No matter how much we may develop this bright virtue according to the teachings of Confucius, we are still creatures of God
Even if one develops his conscience to a very high degree, he is still merely a creature of God, because he does not have the life of God
In contrast to both ethics and religion, it is not the goal of God's salvation to develop the virtues of God's creatures
Due to the influence of our religious background and environment, we Christians may not realize how wealthy we are
In response to Philip's request to show the disciples the Father, the Lord Jesus said, 'He who has seen Me has seen the Father'
As a careful study of verses 17 and 18 discloses, the coming of the Spirit of reality is the coming of the Lord Jesus Himself
To be loved by the Father and to have the Father and the Son make an abode with us is surely a matter of experience, not of doctrine
It is absolutely right according to the Scriptures to speak of the Trinity in relation to our spiritual experience
The followers of Confucius' teachings may boast in their bright virtue, but we can boast that the Triune God dwells within us
It is possible for us to walk by the Triune God because we have been born of Him to be His sons with His life and nature
Unbelievers, including the learned followers of Confucius, cannot walk by the Spirit because they do not have the Spirit within them
As Gods sons we are not developing our bright virtue we are walking according to our God according to the Father the Son and the Spirit
A second kind of teaching is that in order to live properly we need to be led, inspired, and strengthened by the Holy Spirit
It certainly is not wrong to exhort others to trust in the Holy Spirit and to receive help from the Holy Spirit
If we trust in the Holy Spirit on the ground of being God's creatures, we are actually usurping the aid of the Spirit
It is right to trust in the Spirit, but the ground of a creature is not the proper standing for trusting in Him
According to the third kind of teaching, we have been born of God to be sons of God with the divine life and nature
Because we are God's sons, He not only gives us the Spirit, but He Himself is now the Spirit within us to make us sons in a full way
Many Christians borrow Galatians 5:16, take it out of context, and use it to charge the believers to walk by the Spirit
Because we are God's sons and because the Triune God is working within us toward the goal of full sonship, we should walk by the Spirit
As a number of Bible teachers have pointed out, the word 'walk' here means to live, move, act, and have our being
Since the word 'walk' has this meaning, why does Paul in verse 25 speak both of living by the Spirit and walking by the Spirit?
Paul also uses the verb stoicheo in 616 And as many as shall walk by this rule peace be upon them and mercy even upon the Israel of God
According to the context, 'this rule' is the rule of being a new creation, as mentioned in the preceding verse
We see that we are to live neither a life of circumcision nor of uncircumcision, neither a religious life nor an unreligious life
God's life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature
We can receive the divine life and nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus and being regenerated by the Spirit
According to Paul's concept in Galatians, a person would still be in the old creation even if he were circumcised
If we would live a new creation, we must do all things in oneness with the Triune God, and the element of God must be wrought into us
The first kind of love, the natural love, the love in the old creation, is the expression of the love of a fallen creature
To live a new creation is to live, walk, have our being, and do all things, great and small, with the element of God
In all that we do, we should act not in ourselves, but according to our regenerated being, filled with the divine element
Suppose that, as an elderly brother who has been in the church life for many years, my roughness and toughness have been dealt with
If we walk 'by this rule,' we shall live neither a religious life nor an unreligious life, but we shall live a new creation as sons of God
When a sister is about to get married, she may vow to herself that she will never lose her temper with her husband
As God's sons, we need to walk according to this Spirit, taking the Spirit as our elementary rule, our basic principle
Rather, our elementary principle should be the new creation, the divine sonship with the life and nature of God
Day by day, we need to take the sonship, the new creation, as our elementary principle and walk according to it
In our daily life we should practice living according to this sonship as our basic principle, our elementary rule
