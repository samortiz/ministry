<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 9:4-5</H2><P>"And it was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth or any green thing or any tree, but men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man." </P><P>From this we can see that these locusts have spiritual (supernatural) knowledge, for they can receive orders and can identify those who have been sealed by God. (The seal in Revelation 7:2-8 should be a kind of hidden sign of God.) God orders them not to harm those who are sealed, but He has not specifically ordered them to harm others. From the words "they should not kill them" in verse 5, we can see that the harming of the unsealed ones in verse 4 is something to which God only acquiesces.</P><P>The tail of a scorpion has a sting. This sting is sharp and hollow. Within the sting of these scorpions there is a poison which can torment men for five months. The "scorpion" is used in the Old Testament as an idiom (2 Chron. 10:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Revelation 9:6</H2><P>"And in those days men will seek death and shall by no means find it; and they will long to die, and death flees from them." </P><P>To "long to die" is to desire to die, while to "seek death" is to try to find a way to die. Today death seeks out men, but in the future, men will seek for death. They would rather seek for death than repent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Revelation 9:7-10</H2><P>"And the locusts were like horses prepared for war, and on their heads there were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were like faces of men. And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions. And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses rushing into war. And they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to harm men for five months." </P><P>The appearance of the locusts is like horses prepared for war. They have crowns like gold and breastplates like those of iron. These are for their own protection. This means that men will try their best to withstand them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Revelation 9:11</H2><P>"They have a king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon; and in Greek he has the name Apollyon."</P><P>The king in this verse is Antichrist. The star in 9:1 is Satan himself. Revelation 11:7 speaks of "the beast who comes up out of the abyss," and 13:1 speaks of "a beast coming up out of the sea." This shows that the abyss is under the sea.</P><P>"Abaddon" is the name of a place. The word "destruction" in Proverbs 15:11, 27:20, and Job 26:6 is "Abaddon" in the original language. "Apollyon" is the name of a person; it means the destroying one (Jer. 4:7; 6:26; Isa. 16:4; Dan. 8:24-25; 9:26; 11:44). The name of the messenger from the abyss comes from his place of origin and his conduct.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Revelation 9:12</H2><P>"The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are yet coming after these things." </P><P>In reading the first woe, we have to pay attention to two things: (1) Satan is cast down from heaven, and (2) Antichrist has come out from the abyss. In the first woe he appears on the earth. The forty-two months will be the time for him to actually reign.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE SIXTH TRUMPETâ€”THE SECOND WOE<br>(REVELATION 9:13-21)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 9:13</H2><P>"And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God." </P><P>"A voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God." Some say that this is God answering the prayers of the saints, but there are errors in saying this:</P><P>(1)God's answer to prayers should start before the blowing of the first trumpet, that is, in Revelation 8:3, when the incense came with the prayers out of the golden altar. (The golden altar is the incense altar in the sanctuary.)</P><P>(2)The voice does not come out of the golden altar but out of the four horns of the golden altar. If it were an answer to prayers, the voice should come out of the golden altar itself, since incense is burned in the middle of the altar and not on the four horns. In the Old Testament, only the blood of the sin offering was put upon the four horns of the golden altar (Lev. 16:18). Hence, "a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God" means that God's judgment of man is based on the work of the Lord Jesus. God judges because man does not receive the gospel and does not believe. This is God's voice, for only God is behind the incense altar.</P>
