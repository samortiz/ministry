<h2 class="head2">A Spiritual Attorney</h2><p>It is also correct to translate <i>parakletos</i> in 1 John 2:1 as Advocate. According to the usage in ancient times, this Greek word may refer to a person who functions as an attorney, a legal advocate. The situation in 1 John 2:1 is different from that in John 14:16; it is a situation that requires an advocate or attorney. However, the word &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; does not seem fitting to use in the actual translation of the Word. Therefore, after much consideration, we selected the word Advocate.</p><p>The Advocate in 2:1 is actually a spiritual attorney. This <i>parakletos</i> stands beside us, like a nurse caring for us, and serves us. The <i>parakletos</i> is also a counselor. At school the students have a counselor to help them choose the right courses. Our <i>parakletos</i> also helps us in making choices. In his translation of 1 John 2:1 J. N. Darby uses the word &ldquo;patron.&rdquo; In his note he explains that the word patron is used in the sense of a Roman patron, who maintained the interest of his client in every way. One function of a Roman patron was much like that of an attorney today. When we are in a particular kind of situation, we may give the entire matter over into the hands of an attorney. The attorney then takes care of our case. This is the function of our Advocate in 2:1.</p><p><i>Parakletos</i> is an all-inclusive word. It implies the thought of helping and nourishing, the thought of counseling, and also the thought of consoling. It includes the concept of an advocate, an attorney, who takes care of our case.</p><h2 class="head2">With the Father</h2><p>John tells us in 2:1 that we have an Advocate with the Father. The phrase &ldquo;with the Father&rdquo; is used also in 1:2. In each case the Greek word translated &ldquo;with&rdquo; is <i>pros,</i> with the accusative, a preposition of motion, implying living, acting, in union and communion with. The Lord Jesus as our Advocate is living in communion with the Father.</p><p>John&rsquo;s use of Father as the divine title here indicates that our case, which the Lord Jesus as our Advocate undertakes for us, is a family affair, a case between children and the Father. Through regeneration we have been born children of God. After regeneration, in case we sin, it is a matter of children sinning against their Father. Our Advocate, who is our propitiation, undertakes for our sinning to restore our interrupted fellowship with the Father so that we may abide in the enjoyment of the divine fellowship.</p><p>In the past I wondered why John told us that we have an Advocate with the Father. An advocate is someone involved in cases of law. We can easily see why we may need an advocate, an attorney, with the judge in a court of law. But why do we need an advocate with our Father? The answer to this question is that the &ldquo;case&rdquo; of our sins after regeneration is a matter involving the Father and the family &ldquo;law court.&rdquo; Whenever we sin, we offend our Father. Our judge, therefore, is a Father-judge, our court is our spiritual home, and our case is a family matter. But we do have a member of our family, our elder Brother, the Lord Jesus, who is our Advocate with the Father. As our Advocate, our elder Brother takes our case. This is the reason John does not say that we have an Advocate with God, but says that we have an Advocate with the Father.</p><p>A child may have the mistaken idea that because his father loves him, he can do anything he wants at home with his family. Of course, this is not the case. Although our Father loves us, any sins we commit are an offense against Him. Yes, God is our Father. But if we sin, He will have a case against us. Therefore, in our spiritual family we sometimes need an Advocate.</p><p>In this verse we have two important titles&mdash;Advocate and Father. The title Father indicates that we are in the divine family enjoying the Father&rsquo;s love. The title Advocate indicates that we may be wrong in certain matters and need someone to take our case. Hence, in family life we need our elder Brother to be our Advocate who takes our case.</p><p>The truth in the Bible is always presented in a balanced way. The truth in this verse is also balanced. On the one hand, the title Father is a sign of love; on the other hand, the title Advocate is a sign of righteousness. For example, a father loves his child. But if the child misbehaves, the father will have a case against him, a case based on righteousness. Although the child is still loved by his father and will continue to be taken care of by him, the father has a case against the child and may need to discipline him. In a similar way, whenever we sin, the Father has a case against us. Therefore, we need a heavenly attorney. We need Jesus Christ, our elder Brother, to be our Advocate.</p><p>We have emphasized the fact that Christ is our Advocate with the Father. Please notice that John does not say that we have an Advocate with God, or that we have the Son with the Father. Rather, he tells us that if we sin, we have an Advocate with the Father.</p>
