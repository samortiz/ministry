   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. GOD DESIRING TO EXPRESS HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH A PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s desire is to express Himself through a people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He wants to make this people His dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, this people must become God s expression corresponding to His law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since God s law is the expression of what God is, to correspond to the law is to correspond to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s people can have such a correspondence only by loving Him and being infused with His substance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOD HAVING SOUGHT HIS PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AS THE BELOVED SEEKING LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Song of Songs, the man is the beloved, and the woman, the one who lovingly seeks him, is his love 1:13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the beloved is the husband, whereas his love is the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible reveals that in the Old Testament God sought His people as the Beloved seeking someone to be His love, His spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you read Exodus 1 through 20 in this light, you will see that in these chapters God came a number of times to woo His people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After wooing them, He became engaged to them at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. Having Revealed Himself to Them</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>as Jehovah Their God, the Great I Am</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Exodus 3:14-15, the Lord revealed Himself to His people as Jehovah their God, the great I Am, the One who was, who is, and who will be forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The One who so revealed Himself to the people was the One who was seeking lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. Loving Them with Everlasting Love</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Jeremiah 31:3 the Lord told His people, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore, with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Elsewhere we are told that God loved Jacob, but hated Esau Rom 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There seems to be no reason for God s love for His people; He just loved them, almost as if He were blinded by love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He continued to love His people even when they were not faithful to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Love blinds people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The best love is this kind of blind love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are not blind, you will not be able to love properly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If your eyes are open to all the faults of the one you love, you may want a separation, or even a divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if you love blindly, you will consider your husband or wife to be the best.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In loving His people, God seemed to close His eyes and to love them blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the matter of love, do not be wiser than God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Follow Him to love your spouse blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I was young, I wondered if God had been mistaken in loving Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though Jacob was a supplanter, God loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God still loves Israel with an everlasting love, just as He did when He uttered the words of love in Jeremiah 31:3.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many nations may rise up against Israel, but God continues to love His people with an everlasting love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>C. Dealing with Them as His Spouse</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because God was the Beloved seeking His people to be His love, He dealt with them as His spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is indicated clearly in Jeremiah 2:2; Hosea 2:19-20; Isaiah 54:5; and Ezekiel 16:8.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>D. Revealing to Them What He Is</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By Giving Them His Law in a Courting Way</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have pointed out again and again that God s law was given in a courting way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By giving His people the law in such a way, God made known to them what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In each of the first five commandments, He referred to Himself intimately as Jehovah thy God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revealing Himself as a jealous God, He requested that they have no other god, no other beloved, besides Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was seeking their love so that they would keep His commandments to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The same concept is found in John 14:21 and 23.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 21 says, He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me; and he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As in Exodus 20:1-12, here we see the Lord s love in courting us and in seeking a people to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In John 14:23 the Lord continues, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the New Testament as well as in the Old Testament, God is courting man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The commandments in 20:1-12 were given not in a legal way, but in a courting way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In giving the law to His people, God wanted them to become His lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not love God, we shall not be able to keep His commandments, and thus we shall not be able to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The goal of engagement is to bring two people into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In marriage a man and his wife become one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In like manner, God and His chosen people became one through the engagement which took place in Exodus 20.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This oneness both between God and His people and between husband and wife is a basic principle in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, many Bible teachers neglect this aspect of the giving of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead, they emphasize the distance between God and His people and the fact that God wanted them to keep the commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we cannot deny the fact that the Ten Commandments served as an engagement paper and that the engagement of God and His people brought them into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In a proper marriage, a man and his wife become more and more one as the years go by.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Gradually they become one in habit, characteristics, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Likewise, eventually God s chosen people will become the same as He is and thus will truly express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to be infused with the Lord as our Husband, becoming more and more like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we shall become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to the Bible, this basic principle applies both to human marriage and to the love relationship between God and His people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The function of an engagement paper is to make the two parties, the man and the woman, one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the same principle, the function of the Word of God is to make us one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For God to say that He betrothed Israel unto Himself means that He has caused His people to become one with Him as a wife is one with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God s words cause His spouse to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The highest function of the law is to bring God s chosen people into oneness with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Ten Commandments are not simply regulations decreed by God as the highest authority in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The law is an engagement paper which brings us to God and makes us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is also true of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The primary function of the Bible is to bring us to God and make us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because we love God, we also love His word.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As His words infuse Himself into us, we become one with Him in life, nature, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This understanding of the law as God s living word and of the Bible shows forth the intrinsic function of the law and of the Bible, the Word of God.</S>
