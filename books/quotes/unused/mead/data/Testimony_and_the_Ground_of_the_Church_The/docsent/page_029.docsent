   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Practice Differently Based on Doctrine</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and to Be Divided from Others</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being a Fleshly Act</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Human mentality is strange.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the church there are people with all sorts of strange thoughts; furthermore, they all base their thoughts on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They can find many doctrines from the Bible as grounds for their strange suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was young, I met a group of Christians who said that the church should not love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based on this conviction, they decided that any brother who came to their meetings must have his head shaved and should wear shoes made only of cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If someone wore leather shoes and had enough hair to be parted in the middle, they would push him out of the door.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, they also decided that the sisters could not wear a long gown popular in modern China.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, they could wear only blouses with skirts or with long pants.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a sister was not dressed in this way, she would be accused of loving the world and would be forbidden from coming into their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the beginning I was quite touched by them, but gradually I felt that this was not right.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to their decisions, a good number of Christians could no longer meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This illustrates how Christians can have strange thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people find many doctrines in the Bible and use them as a basis for dividing from others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I would like to say a strong word: All of these activities are of the flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who do not have a shaved head can come, and those whose hair is shaved can come also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who wear cloth shoes can come, and those who wear leather shoes can come also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who wear Western style suits can come, and those who wear Chinese style clothes can come also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everyone can come.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church absolutely cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should ask only whether a person has the one faith, whether he has the Spirit within, whether he has the Lord, and whether he has God; all other things should not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let me give you another example.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In northern China there once was a group of believers who were very zealous, who loved the Lord very much, and who were very much blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they sang hymns in the meetings, they would sway their bodies and clap their hands simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes people who came into their meeting would leave after sitting for a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If one was asked why he left, he would say, I cannot stand the swaying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes one of the swaying ones would go to a place that had quiet meetings, and he would leave after sitting for less than five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he was asked why he left, he would say, I cannot bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The meeting is too rigid and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do the swaying brothers have the one faith?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do the quiet brothers have the one faith?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They do as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, because of insignificant matters such as swaying and being quiet, these groups of brothers cannot be one, even though they have the one faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Should these matters be counted as the faith?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Should these matters be used as a basis for being one or for being divided?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These things are altogether human opinions, human views.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we use such things as a basis for doing something unconventional and unorthodox, and thereby separate ourselves from others, this is a fleshly act which is absolutely not pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Galatians 5:20 the Greek word for sects means heresies, referring to schools of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that people use doctrines or opinions to form sects; that is, they divide from others because of different practices based on a certain doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 19 says that sects are a work of the flesh, an action by the flesh; hence, it is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Scriptures Requiring Us</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>to Receive Those Who Eat Only Vegetables</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>and Those Who Observe Days</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the Bible, even such matters as eating only vegetables and observing days must not be used as a basis for dividing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 14:1-6 shows that it is all right to eat vegetables and to observe days, and that it is also all right to not eat vegetables and to not observe days.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He who eats and he who observes, eats and observes to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Likewise, he who does not eat and he who does not observe, does not eat and does not observe to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He who eats and he who observes should not despise him who does not eat and him who does not observe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Likewise, he who does not eat and he who does not observe should not judge him who eats and him who observes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The former should not reject the latter, nor should the latter refuse the former, because both the former and the latter have been received by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all have been received by the Lord, so we should receive one another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not say that we cannot take it, nor should we say that we cannot bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to bear it even if it is unbearable, unless we do not want to be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we want to be Christians, we cannot avoid meeting some peculiar brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But no matter how peculiar a brother may be, we still need to bear him and cannot be separated from him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church really is a mystery; it is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Countless numbers of peculiar people have been saved throughout the ages, and they are all our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They all belong to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to receive them, and we cannot be divided from them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even those who preach the word have idiosyncrasies.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some of the preachers stand straight even perfectly straight when they preach, without moving their body at all.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But they are full of power to move people.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many people admire preachers who are so dignified and proper, considering them to be true servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But other preachers leap and jump and cry and shout when they preach.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once I saw a brother preaching the gospel, and it was truly exciting.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>While he was preaching, he would jump around on the platform and then suddenly jump off the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That was truly difficult for me to take.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Nonetheless, hundreds and thousands were saved through him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What can we say?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our God is so great and so mysterious that we simply cannot limit Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Perhaps we prefer preachers who behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we see a man with well-mannered preaching, we may praise him highly, thinking that this kind of behavior is befitting to a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we see someone leaping and jumping while preaching, we might say that he is crazy and does not look like a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, we may not listen to his preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, those who prefer action may approve of him, saying that this kind of preaching can stir up people and touch their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>For them, well-mannered preaching is rigid and dead, and it instantly puts people to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, it is intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Nevertheless, all of these things should be tolerable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We all need to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must remember that the oneness of the church needs only the one faith.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Having one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We cannot make other demands on our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A brother may jump and swing, but does he not have God?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Does he not have the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Does he not have the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Is he not a member of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He has God, the Lord, and the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>And he is a member of the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We must acknowledge that he is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We need to bear the cross; there is nothing else that matters.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In like manner, there is no problem in being well-mannered and quiet; one should not be condemned for being deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We all need forbearance with one another.</S>
