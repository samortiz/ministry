   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE PROGRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Eph 4:11-16; 1 Cor 14:23a, 26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Beginning in August of 1988, the Lord has been speaking to us concerning His organic Body and the organic building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this book we want to see the Lord s advanced recovery according to His present speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE BEGINNING OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>FROM THE SECOND CENTURY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine revelation of the New Testament was fully completed with Paul s ministry and John s mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament tells us that at the end of Paul s ministry, the church began to degrade and become deformed from the divine revelation 2 Tim 1:15; 2:16 3:13; 4:10, 14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later, the Apostle John wrote to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, telling them to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord charged the churches to repent of the degradation into which they had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Within the first century were the completing of the divine revelation and the degradation of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord came in to point out the degradation of the church and to sound out a call for some overcomers who would come back to the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life 2:7 , the hidden manna 2:17 , and the feast 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to church history, the Lord s recovery with His overcomers began in the second century.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even within such a short time after the completion of the divine revelation, the church fell into degradation, so there was the need of a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE PROGRESS OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THROUGH THE CENTURIES</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother E. H. Broadbent in his book The PilgrimChurch pointed out that the line of the Lord s recovery started in the second century and has continued throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, at the time of the Reformation with Martin Luther, the recovery of the Lord came into a definite form.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord used Martin Luther to recover the basic truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the seventeenth century, some within the Catholic Church reacted to the deadness of the reformed churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These were the mystics, whom the Lord used to recover the experiences of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord went on in the eighteenth century with Zinzendorf to recover the initial stage of the church life in the unity of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the early part of the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England under the leadership of John Nelson Darby to recover the church life in a fuller way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This recovered church life might be considered as the fulfillment of the epistle to Philadelphia in Revelation 3.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Brethren began in 1828, but within ninety years they were divided into about one hundred divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the early part of the twentieth century, the Lord caught a young man in China named Watchman Nee, and the Lord used him to continue His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This advance in the Lord s recovery struck God s enemy, so His enemy rose up against it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mainland China was lost into the hands of the communists, who were absolutely against the Lord s interests on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee was put into prison in 1952 and died there in 1972.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When mainland China was about to be lost, I was sent to Taiwan in 1949, and the Lord began His testimony on that island.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From that time to 1958 on the island of Taiwan, we basically kept what we had seen and received of the Lord through Brother Nee s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In those years, we did not have much advance in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From 1958 to 1989, at least ten big divine items have been recovered as a continuation of the Lord s recovery in the years before.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first item is eating Christ, enjoying Christ, and experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eating Christ is for enjoying Christ, and enjoying Christ is for experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second item is that Christ in His resurrection became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord showed us this particular point in the divine revelation in 1 Corinthians 15:45b.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The third item is calling on the name of the Lord O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This practice is fully recorded in many verses in both the Old and New Testaments, but we saw this and practiced it only within the past thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We taste the inward sweetness of the Lord when we call O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fourth item is that the Triune God has been processed and consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fifth item is the all-inclusive, compounded, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold, and consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sixth item is the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The processed Triune God is dispensing Himself into His people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The seventh item is that the processed Triune God has been dispensed into the transformed, tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We saw this truth in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The eighth item is that the riches of Christ after being enjoyed by the saints become the fullness of Christ for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The fullness of Christ is the church, the Body of Christ as the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The ninth item is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the sanctified man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The tenth item is God s New Testament economy.</S>
