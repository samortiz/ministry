WITH THE LORD REGULARLY</h2>
<p>Everyone who bears responsibility in a &ldquo;class&rdquo; must exercise his spirit regularly. This will strengthen, enliven, and enable his spirit to be easily released. It is not enough to merely be open; he must also be able to release his spirit. He cannot perform. If he does not exercise his spirit to fellowship with the Lord regularly, his exercise in the class will only be a performance.</p>
<p>We must practice to fellowship with the Lord in our spirit even in the midst of our busy schedules. Everyone is busy with many things. According to our experience, it is very difficult to set aside half an hour each day to pray. Sisters are busy from morning until evening taking care of their families, and brothers have difficult situations and work-related matters that often overwhelm them. Although we all desire to set aside time to contact the Lord, it is not easy. We can solve this problem by setting aside a little time to contact the Lord every day and by practicing to contact the Lord when we are busy doing practical things. For example, when we are riding the bus to work, or when we are waiting for something, we should do our best to ignore the outward environment and focus on fellowshipping with the Lord. We can practice being joined to the Lord in our office or in other places.</p>
<p>The way to practice this is by speaking to the Lord. When we have a little time, we should fellowship with Him. This is not a small thing. In terms of bodily exercise, it may seem as if we have no opportunity to exercise, but actually we do many physical things every day that we do not notice. For example, a person who has been sick and in bed for a long time will have a difficult time walking long distances when he gets out of bed, because he has not been &ldquo;practicing&rdquo; to walk. However, before he was sick, he had no difficulty walking. This shows that we should not belittle the routine walking that we do every day. Even household chores, such as wiping the chairs and tables, involve physical activity. Of course, it is best if we can devote some time specifically to physical exercise, but if our time or circumstances do not allow this, we can still sweep the floor, clean the windows, or make our beds. These activities are beneficial to the body.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to spiritual things. It is good to set aside some time every day to exercise our spirit in fellowship with the Lord. However, if this is too difficult because of time and circumstances, we must still find other opportunities to exercise. We should learn to exercise our spirit in every circumstance. We must remember that we belong to the Lord and that the Lord is dwelling in our spirit, which is the Holy of Holies. Thus, our fellowship with the Lord need not be limited by circumstances related to time or space.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters desire to be free of every earthly entanglement so that they can fully concentrate on praying and contacting the Lord. This reflects a desire to seek spiritual cultivation by leaving the secular world and &ldquo;going to the mountains.&rdquo; This never works. In church history there have been groups of ascetic monks who left the secular world to live the life of a hermit in the wilderness or on a mountain. They devoted themselves solely to prayer and to seeking the Lord. It is quite strange, however, that none of these had any spiritual descendants, and their history did not last very long.</p>
<p>We should not think that we are unable to contact the Lord because we are busy with work. We must believe that the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement is the best environment for us to be built up. Many sisters say that if they were single, they would be like Mary. This is a simplistic thought, because being like Mary does not depend upon a sister&rsquo;s marital status. On the contrary, even in the midst of a busy schedule, involving taking care of her husband and children, it is possible for a sister to contact the Lord and receive some perfecting. Sometimes even a maid, who quits as soon as she is trained to do household chores, can be used by the Lord to perfect a sister. Similarly, when a situation arises that prevents us from fellowshipping with the Lord at a set time, the difficulties and hardships can still be an opportunity for us to have real fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHAT WE DO DEPENDING ON WHAT WE ARE</h2>
<p>In order to perfect and help the brothers and sisters, a living in fellowship with the Lord must become part of our very being. We can only perfect others according to what we are. A person can only perfect someone to be like him; anything other than this involves acting. We can encourage the brothers and sisters only with what we have learned. What we present to others should come out of our actual living before the Lord. If we learn this way and live this way, we will be able to lead the brothers and sisters in the same way. If we only pretend to be spiritual, our work will never be spiritual. A senior brother once said, &ldquo;Our work can never surpass what we are,&rdquo; and I can fully confirm this word. Our work and our leading can never surpass our living and our learning. We can only supply others according to what we have learned and how we live.</p>
<p>Although there are certain skills involved in leading others, the most fundamental point is that we need to exercise to live before the Lord. The Chinese have a good proverb, which says, &ldquo;What is inward is reflected on the outward.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said something even better: &ldquo;Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks&rdquo; (Matt. 12:34). This means that what we are within will be manifested without. We cannot hide what we are, even if we try. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, His glory was revealed even though it was concealed behind the veil of His flesh and even though He did not seek to reveal it. When a person moves a glass of water that is filled to the brim, some water will spill over. The Lord was filled with God&rsquo;s riches and glory to such an extent that whenever He moved or did anything, His glory was manifested. Everyone He contacted sensed the glory of His divine life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
