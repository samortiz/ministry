   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE SERVICE AND RESPONSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE ELDERSHIP Scripture Reading: Acts 20:17-20, 27, 31</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we would like to fellowship concerning the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one among the saints is qualified in himself for the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 2 Corinthians 3:5, the Apostle Paul said that we are not sufficient of ourselves but that our sufficiency is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So, all the brothers who bear the responsibility of the eldership should put their trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to be faithful to their responsibility, they should spend more time for the church and pay more attention to the saints by visiting them individually.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Acts 20 is the record of a word by Paul addressed to the elders from Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was given in Miletus while Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem for the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From Miletus Paul sent some to ask the elders in Ephesus to come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verses 17 through 19 say, And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And when they came to him, he said to them, You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time, serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears and trials which came upon me by the plots of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time Paul and these believers were people absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the same time there was another group of people, the Jews, who claimed to be for God also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These two were in rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Jews even hated Paul and his followers to such an extent that they plotted and conspired to damage Paul and his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>PAUL BEING A PATTERN TO THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul is a real pattern to all of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is a real pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although he himself had never been an elder, yet he set up a model, a pattern, an example for the elders whom he had trained.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So, whatever he spoke about himself, his expectation was that all the elders would follow his steps and imitate what he had been doing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Paul said that he was serving the Lord as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The elders all have to serve the Lord as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are not put into a position of dignity or rank.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the church there is no rank and no position.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is only humility and slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Following humility there are tears, not joy and happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then third are the trials which come upon us from other people who claim to be for God, and even conspire to undermine the work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>SERVING AS SLAVES</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Elders should serve the Lord not just as servants, but slaves, losing their right and all kinds of liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, to be put into the eldership is to be brought into slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all are slaves to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To serve the Lord here is not to serve the Lord directly, but indirectly by serving His people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The elders must pick up the burden of a slave to serve the big family of their Master.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must behave, do things, and even have our being as slaves with all humility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should brand ourselves with the word humility.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have no right to be proud of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything that is glorious should go to our Master.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the only One who is qualified to be proud of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are destined to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be humble is not an easy thing; to be proud is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be humble and even to be humbled is not a happy thing, but a thing of tears.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the elders never to drop tears for the saints under their care might not be so good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Tears should go along with our humility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should be humbled by the situation and ready to accept the trials from others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This portion of the Word spoken by Paul is not only an admonishing word, but also a kind of prediction or foretelling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not only a charge but also a foretelling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is pictured in these few verses is exactly the situation in which we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul was serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears because at his time there were others competing with him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They even plotted to undermine his work, his ministry, and himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So, trials followed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The elders should not anticipate much comfort but be prepared to face sufferings and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, we all must pick up the burden of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet, on the other hand, we must be ready to face any kind of trials that come upon us from others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At Paul s time the trials came from the Jews who were not atheists, but those who worshipped God, and, in their view, served God.</S>
