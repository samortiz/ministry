<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
GOD BEING LIFE TO MAN<br />
AND THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:9, 16-17; 10:16; 12:12-13; 1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:4-5</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF GOD BEING LIFE TO MAN<br />
BEING HIS HABITATION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s ultimate goal in being life to man and in mingling with man is to have a habitation. According to the Bible, God&rsquo;s work does not only consist of creation and redemption. His work includes His entering into man to live in man as life and to build the church as His habitation. As the result of His work, He will obtain a habitation&mdash;the holy city, New Jerusalem, which is depicted at the end of the Bible (Rev. 21:2, 10). Bible readers admit that the New Jerusalem is the ultimate and highest result of God&rsquo;s work. The New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s habitation in the universe; it is where He can settle down. Hence, God&rsquo;s final step in being our life is to make us His habitation, to make His home in us.</p>
<p>God will not make us individually His home. God has only one home, not many homes. First Peter 2:5 says that the believers are living stones, not houses. A stone cannot become a house by itself. Rather, many stones must be built together in order to become a house. The spirit of every saved person is God&rsquo;s habitation; God dwells in our spirit (1 Cor. 3:16). The God who dwells in you also dwells in me and in every other believer. The one God dwells in all of us. Hence, His habitation is formed by our being built together (Eph. 2:22).</p>
<p>We can use electrical lamps as an illustration. Suppose we have twenty lamps, and every lamp has electricity. There is only one electrical current; hence, the lamps do not have their own electricity. There can be dozens of electric lamps, but there will be only one electrical current in them. In the same way, although there are many believers, there is only one God in us. This God is the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one Father (Eph. 4:4-6). The Father is in the Son, the Son has become the Spirit, and the Spirit dwells in our spirit.</p>
<p>When we deny ourselves, take God as life, live by Him, and let Him make home in our hearts, we will not be divided; instead, we will be one, because we will have God as our oneness. If after we are saved, we still live by our natural life and do not take God as life, we will not be one. If there is no oneness among us, we will not be the church. There will be many believers but not a built-up church. When every saint learns to deny himself and let God make His home in him, we will come together in oneness. There will be no you and no me; there will only be God. Only then will God be able to make His home in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING BUILT<br />
WHEN GOD MAKES HIS HOME IN US</h2>
<p>Those in whom God can make His home, who let Him make His home in them, are being built up by God in the church. Such ones are not in themselves; they are in God, and God is the factor of their oneness. This oneness is the building, the church.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul speaks of the church as the Body. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; This verse does not say, &ldquo;So also is the church&rdquo; but &ldquo;so also is the Christ.&rdquo; The Body is constituted with many members and is not only the church. The Body is the Christ, because Christ is expressed through the members. These members do not live in their soul-life but in the divine life; they do not live by themselves but by Christ. Hence, when these members are joined together, they express Christ.</p>
<p>Our physical body has many members but only one life. Our physical life cannot be divided. The life in our hands exists at the same time in our feet, and the life in our ears exists simultaneously in our eyes. All our members have the same life. Our members can be coordinated and fitly joined to be one body because they have the same life. If one member does not have this life, it must be detached from our body. Similarly, the church is expressed through all the members taking Christ as life practically. If two brothers live in Christ, take Him as life, and let Him make His home in them, they will be blended together and will become one. Christ can make His home in us simultaneously, because we live in Him and are being delivered from ourselves; thus, there is a oneness among us. This oneness is the Lord, and it is also the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO SIGNIFICANCES<br />
OF BREAKING BREAD</h2>
<p>There are two significances to our breaking bread. The first significance is that when we break bread, we remember and enjoy the Lord. The bread signifies the Lord&rsquo;s body, which was broken for us on the cross, and the cup signifies His blood, which was shed for us on the cross (Matt. 26:26-28; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-26). When we break bread, we receive the bread and the cup. This indicates that we receive the Lord again. Our receiving and enjoying Him in this way is our remembrance of Him. The first significance of breaking the bread emphasizes our relationship with the Lord.</p>
<p>The second significance of breaking bread emphasizes our relationship with the saints. The bread that we break refers not only to the Lord&rsquo;s physical body but also to His mystical Body, which He gained in the Holy Spirit through His death and resurrection (10:16-17). The Lord Jesus gave up His physical body on the cross, and after His resurrection He gained His mystical Body in the Holy Spirit. The physical body that He gave on the cross was small, but the mystical Body that He gained in resurrection is large. The body that He gave was physical and had flesh and blood, but the Body that He gained is mystical and spiritual. The Body that He gained is comprised of all the believers throughout the ages. These are the two significances of our breaking bread.</p>
<p>When we break bread, we not only receive the Lord, enjoy Him, and remember Him, but we also contact the saints, fellowship with them, and enjoy them. When we break bread, we enjoy not only the Lord but also the saints. We can read the Bible by ourselves, and we can pray by ourselves, but we cannot break the bread by ourselves. In order to break bread, there should be at least three to five saints. This is the principle of the Body.</p>
<p>Among God&rsquo;s children there is the concept of remembering the Lord when breaking bread, but they break bread while neglecting the mutual fellowship and enjoyment. The saints who criticize others and have unresolved problems yet break bread on the Lord&rsquo;s Day only remember the Lord; they do not have fellowship with the other members. Such bread-breaking cannot be considered as genuine. For this reason, the apostle Paul rebuked the Corinthians believers. Even though they ate the bread, there were divisions among them; hence, they were not eating the Lord&rsquo;s supper, and this offended the Lord (11:17-22). When we come together to break bread, we must deal with ourselves thoroughly before the Lord. We cannot criticize the saints or the church, on the one hand, yet break the bread, on the other. We must deal with such a situation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
