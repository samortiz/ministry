   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VOLUNTARY POVERTY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Zaccheus gave away all his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why do Christians not do the same today?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: The Lord said that a man should sell his all and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This word was said only two years prior to Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is true that the Lord was mindful of the poor, but His eyes were more on dealing with the rich when He said this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord did not deal with the rich for the purpose of taking care of the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Judas suggested selling the ointment to give to the poor, but the Lord did not agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He knew that a man cannot be a good Christian as long as money is kept tightly in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Giving to the poor is merely a means; the goal is to deal with mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time of Pentecost there were poor people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The disciples turned over all the proceeds they received through the sale of possessions and put them at the feet of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These were then distributed to everyone according to his need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the only way to deal with the problem of money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, the main purpose of the Lord's dealing with money is to free men from its entanglement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today in the church, we also need to deal with the problem of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All money should be brought to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, there are many needs and lacks in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if there were no lack in the church today, we would still have to give our money to it because we need to be delivered from the bondage of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Acts 2 and 4, we find the believers in one place, sharing all things in common, selling their land and possessions, and distributing to each according to need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter eleven we find a great famine, and the church in Antioch sent relief to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The problem of mammon must be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not think of our money as something precious when we offer it up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, we should rid ourselves of it like Paul did with the snake.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Christian should loathe having mammon in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He should take the way of voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a basic teaching and a fundamental concept in the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Selling one's all is not a one-time act.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to do it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who sow much will reap much, and those who sow little will reap little.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord considers the act of selling one's all a kind of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who sow much will reap much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some brothers and sisters have sold their all two or three times already.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After three or five years, they have to do the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have to keep on doing this; they cannot stop at a certain point.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mammon is unrighteous in itself; it is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Would we dare leave an idol in our house?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>None of us would dare do this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we are parsimonious, we are keeping one more idol in our house every time we keep one more dollar in it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This principle applies equally to the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They have to give their all as well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are not absolute in this matter, others cannot be absolute in it either.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to see that money is a greater bondage to man than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If Satan were to come to us and beat his chest, saying, "I am Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Worship me," everyone would run away in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If he unmasked himself in this way, everyone would be afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if he were to come under the disguise of money, everyone would worship him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Money can buy everything, even human souls.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It can buy male, and it can buy female.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It can buy grown-ups, and it can buy children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our gospel must be so powerful that a sinner will give up everything as soon as he believes and enters the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some may say that this is too dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who would be saved by this kind of preaching?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is awesome not only to you; it was awesome to Peter as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle than for a rich man to enter God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today, however, we have to make all the "camels" go through the eye of the needle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During the last century, J. N. Darby and over fifty other believers sold their all to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Their ministry became a powerful one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>St. Francis of Assisi was another example from the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was burdened for the gospel yet did not have the gift of an evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His speaking was uncouth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Later he retreated to the wilderness and the seashore to preach to the birds and the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Originally, he was a very rich man or the son of a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Within a matter of days, he sold all he had, gave it to the poor, and lived a life of voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The order which he founded became one of the three main monastic orders in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Anyone who wished to join the order had to sell his all before he could be admitted.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These men were not that clear about the gospel, but their practice of voluntary poverty is commendable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Count Zinzendorf of the Moravian movement was another example of this kind of living; he lived before Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His church received great attention because of his political prominence.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His main work was done in eastern Europe, not in western Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was a wealthy landlord, yet he offered up everything he had to serve the Lord.</S>
