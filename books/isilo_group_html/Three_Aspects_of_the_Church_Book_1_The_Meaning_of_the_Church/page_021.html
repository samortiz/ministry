<h2 class="head1">TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>When we speak of the types of the church, we need to start from the very beginning of the Bible. In the Old Testament, God arranged a number of persons, matters, and things to be types of the church in order to explain the history, the process, and the different aspects of the church in the New Testament. In the Old Testament, God did not explicitly speak of the church. Hence, the church was hidden. God, however, arranged certain persons and established certain matters and things to portray and typify the various aspects of the church in a detailed way.</p>
<p>In the age of the Old Testament people did not know the meaning of the types, but in the age of the New Testament the Holy Spirit reveals the significance of these types. The types of the church as revealed in the Old Testament make it easier for us to know the various aspects of the church. When we speak concerning the church, we must not overlook the types in the Old Testament. The Old Testament can be likened to a picture, and the New Testament, to a written explanation. What is not clearly understood by the picture can be made clear by the words of the explanation. Likewise, what is difficult to explain in written words can be easily understood in the picture.</p>
<p>The types in the Old Testament can be likened to the pictures in an elementary school textbook that visually illustrate what has been written. An elementary school textbook has not only text but also pictures. By comparing the words and the pictures, the point being conveyed becomes clear. The many types in the Old Testament depict various aspects of the church that are not explicitly spoken of in the New Testament. When we read passages related to the types, we must not be too fast, because a single line in the picture may convey much meaning. Those who pursue to know the church must know the types in the Old Testament concerning the church.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the types of the church fall into two general categories: first, women, revealing that the church is a counterpart, which focuses on the church&rsquo;s life and position; second, the city, the tabernacle, or the temple, revealing that the church is a dwelling place, which focuses on the church&rsquo;s function.</p>
<p>According to type, the position of the church before God is that of a counterpart. God&rsquo;s counterpart has the position of a woman who matches a man. In the entire Bible God likens Himself to a man, and He likens the totality of His created and redeemed people to a woman as His counterpart. The purpose of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages, whether in creation or redemption, is to produce a corporate woman. At the end of the Bible, at the completion of God&rsquo;s work, a bride is produced&mdash;the holy city New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the corporate woman whom God desires. It is composed of God&rsquo;s created and redeemed people as the consummation and aggregate of the church.</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that Christ came to the earth seeking a group of people to redeem to be His bride. When the Lord Jesus was working for God on the earth, John the Baptist introduced Him with two titles: <em>the Lamb of God</em> (John 1:29) and <em>the bridegroom</em> (3:29). Hence, the Lord Jesus came to the earth not only to take away the sin of the world but also to gain a group of people to be His counterpart. When the Lord was on the earth, He referred to Himself as a bridegroom (Matt. 9:15) who desires to marry a bride. In his Epistles Paul says clearly that he betrothed the church as a pure virgin to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). A betrothal refers to an engagement. Revelation 19:7 reveals the marriage of the Lamb. The phrase <em>marriage of the Lamb</em> connects both titles that John the Baptist used for the Lord Jesus, revealing that the Lamb is the Bridegroom. The bride whom Christ will marry is the totality of His redeemed from all the ages, that is, the church. Hence, according to typology, the church always stands in the position of a woman. In the Old Testament the church is often typified by women.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 1, The Meaning of the Church &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
