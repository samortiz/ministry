 <h2 class="head1">OUR NEED TO SHEPHERD OTHERS IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will speak concerning our need to shepherd people. To speak about this is difficult, because this matter touches each one of us. To play politics with people is easy, but to touch people in an honest, frank way is not easy. In 1956, when a servant of the Lord visited us in Taiwan, he recommended to us the political way to touch people. He illustrated this way by saying that we should never speak the truth about little babes to their mothers. If a baby is beautiful, we can say, &ldquo;What a beautiful girl is this!&rdquo; If the baby is not good looking, however, we should say, &ldquo;Oh, what a girl this is!&rdquo; When I heard this, I could not agree with this kind of political speaking. I felt that it was a kind of &ldquo;British diplomacy.&rdquo; In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we cannot play politics in this way. If I were here to play politics, there would be no need for the present training.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Shepherding Being<br />
the Most Demanding Need in the Church</h2>
<p>The sisters who are mothers know that nothing is as demanding as being a mother. Those who have never had children do not know the real meaning of <em>demanding.</em> Nothing and no one in the universe is as demanding as children. If an adult catches a cold, he may not ask for anything, but if a little one has a cold, he must be cared for. A mother can never ask for &ldquo;sick leave.&rdquo; Even if she is about to die, she must first take care of her child&rsquo;s need. It is the same for fathers. A proper father must take care of his children&rsquo;s demand. A child&rsquo;s demand is without mercy. I have seen many young sisters who could not be adjusted by their father, mother, or even husband, but once they had children, they learned many lessons from these little ones (1 Tim. 2:15). Before they have children, some sisters do not practice to rise early in the morning. It seems that everything in their world is just right for sleeping late. After they have children, however, the little ones wake them up very early. Sometimes when I saw this, I wanted to commend the little children and say, &ldquo;Very good! What no one else could accomplish for many years, you have done in only a few months.&rdquo; Nothing is as demanding as shepherding, not even gospel preaching. Just as in child raising, everything related to shepherding is not up to us; it is up to the new ones. We cannot say that we have no time or that it is not convenient. This is for those under our care to decide.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Member in the Church Having<br />
the Normal Ability to Shepherd People</h2>
<p>The way of Christianity is to hire a pastor to shepherd a church. This is not what we mean by shepherding. Some may argue that shepherding is a gift that not every brother or sister has. However, no one would say that raising children is a gift that some have and others do not. Every parent, regardless of how smart or foolish he is, has a talent for raising children. Child raising is not a special talent; it is a talent given by birth. In the same way, by our spiritual birth every member in the church has the gift of shepherding. To say that we do not have the gift of shepherding is to annul our spiritual birth. Some think that because they are too young and are not pastors, elders, or experienced Christians, they cannot shepherd others. This is a wrong understanding and concept. We should forget the wrong teachings we received about shepherding. Someone may not know how to raise children, but when the children come, they are forced to learn. The parents of a young mother may think that she cannot raise her children, but the more they let her do her job, the more she will learn how to do it. We need to drop the wrong concept and pick up the proper one. Even someone who has been saved for only a few days can learn to shepherd.</p>
<p>In order to be the proper, normal members of the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to build up a daily life of the gospel, and we need to go to the Lord for Him to show us who should be under the care of our shepherding. If these two matters are built up in the church, we will have a normal, proper church. A normal church is not merely one in which the members stand to speak something in the meetings. This is only a small part of our service. The main part of the service in the church is a daily gospel life and shepherding. Our concept must be regulated and radically changed. We should realize that it is a great lack and a shame not to bear fruit each year and have someone under our care. All the members in the churches should bear fruit and shepherd people all the time. If we build up these items, the church will be wonderful. The Lord&rsquo;s way is always the best and wisest way. His way is to depend not on spiritual giants but on every member, on those who have a daily gospel life with shepherding. We all need a change of concept in this regard.</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago, I came together every Monday morning with a group of serving ones from 8:00 A.M. until the afternoon to mutually learn how to shepherd people. After meeting for three years in this way, there was a great revival in that locality. This was not due to a movement. It came out spontaneously because of the building up among us. The gospel preaching and the shepherding were adequate and prevailing. This is what the churches need today. The Lord has raised up His recovery in many cities, but we are still short of a daily gospel living and of shepherding.</p>
