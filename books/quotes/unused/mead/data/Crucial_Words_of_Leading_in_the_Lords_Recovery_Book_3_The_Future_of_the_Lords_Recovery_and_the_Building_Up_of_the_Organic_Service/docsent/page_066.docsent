   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORDER OF THE CHURCH SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament speaks of the elders administrating of the church, but it does not stress this point.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 12:28 says, God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Helps refers to deacons and deaconesses, who deal with practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Administrations refers to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Bible readers encounter a difficulty with this verse, because they do not understand why Paul placed the deacons before the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse says, first, second, third, and then, showing that there is an order in these services.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In our view, elders are somewhat higher than the deacons, and they should be mentioned before the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But it seems that Paul considers the service of the deacons to be higher than that of the elders, so he placed the elders after the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last item mentioned is the least desirable speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul placed the elders next to speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to 1 Corinthians 12:28, the first three gifts established by God are apostles, prophets, and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are higher gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then there are works of power and gifts of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today s Pentecostal movement promotes the gift of healing, but it disregards prophesying and teaching the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Prophesying and teaching the Bible are our specialties.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The gifts we have in the Lord s recovery are the highest gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I encourage you to function in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if you are a small sister, you can lead your family members to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you do so, you are an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you speak the Lord s word to your family members, you are prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you can help them understand the Word, you are functioning as a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not, however, encourage you to do works of power, because it is easy to become abnormal or even deluded.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may even think that you can heal all illnesses through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians want to pursue such gifts, but in the Lord s recovery, the Lord does not give us such gifts, and neither do we pay attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We emphasize being apostles, prophets, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul lists helps, administrations, and tongue-speaking as the last items.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul put the eldership last to prevent the elders from elevating themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible does not give ground for the saints to elevate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus told the apostles that none of them should be the master; rather, they were all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whoever wanted to be the greatest among them had to become a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord s recovery follows this pattern and emphasizes it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though the fellowship of the elders should be considered by those who want to serve full time, we should never think that the approval of the elders is a condition for full-time service.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When someone submits a consecration slip, the elders must be careful, because a saint s future in the Lord s service can be ruined if the fellowship of the elders is received as if it is a formal approval.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>LIVING IN SPIRIT WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the formal approval of the elders is not a condition for full-time service, some elders might ask why their consideration is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a question shows an organizational mind that is focused on the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not a question of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as authority is brought into a matter, it becomes organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the elders have a proper understanding, they will follow their inward sense and the anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then their consideration of the saints will not be organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, some elders in the churches cannot distinguish between the organic function of the Body and an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The elders are not part of an organization but rather functioning members of an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they stand on the ground of organization and serve as elders with an organizational view, they are part of an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will have no organic function, and they will not have the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Forgive me for speaking such a strong word, but this is the same as false teeth and prosthetic legs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They do not have an organic function, because they do not have the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The elders in every locality, both in Taiwan and abroad, have made this mistake to one degree or another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They serve as elders in an organizational way, not according to an organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An elder who functions in an organic way will be in fear and trembling as he considers whether a saint should serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul says, Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure Phil 2:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that we have a life in us with an organic function, and this life is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must obey the operating of this life with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to be in fear and trembling; otherwise, we will not pay attention to the Spirit s operating, and we will make our own decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The elders may regard their character, feelings, opinions, thoughts, preferences, and choices too highly, and they may even regard these traits as the reason they were chosen to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they are not watchful, it will be easy to ignore the inward operating of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The sense of life and the anointing of the Spirit are things that we understand doctrinally.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must ask ourselves how many times during the day do we obey the sense of life and the anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Making a small joke can be in disobedience to the operating of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever we speak loosely with others, we lose the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Murmuring and grumbling to others are expressions of ignoring the inward sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must confess that this is our condition, especially with our spouse and other family members.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For this reason in verse 14 Paul says, Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Murmurings are related to our emotions and come mainly from the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Reasonings are related to our mind and come mainly from the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever the sisters stop murmuring to their husbands and the brothers cease reasoning with the ones they coordinate with, they are obeying God s inward operating.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to my observation, no wife lacks love toward her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible does not command the wives to love their husbands, because God knows that the wives love their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Bible does say that the husbands must love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The main problem with husbands is that most of them do not love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, the Bible commands the husbands to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even though the wives love their husbands, the main problem with wives is that they do not submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, it is the husbands who submit to their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Bible does not charge the husbands to submit to their wives, because all husbands submit to their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Wives love their husbands, and husbands submit to their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These are almost iron-clad principles.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, the Bible provides correction and tells husbands to love and wives to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Wives murmur because they love their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If they did not love their husbands, they would not murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The more a wife loves her husband, the more she murmurs.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The same thing happens in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are not many sisters who do not complain about the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The most difficult thing for the elders is the endless complaining and murmuring of the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Although the sisters often lift the elders up very high, they also murmur and complain about the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to take care of the sense of life and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, in our experience we ignore the operation of the Spirit most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we obey the anointing only occasionally, we think that we are spiritual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The greatest danger in the elders administration of the church is not administrating according to the operating of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Of course, the elders do not administrate the church out of evil or bad motives.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, they can administrate out of themselves, rather than by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Some elders have a very good character.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They are thoughtful and capable, even full of insight.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>However, it may be that only a few of their decisions related to the administration of the church are according to the operation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The elders who administrate the churches do not fear the Lord to the extent that they say, I fear the Lord, so I am afraid of my views, ideas, and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I am afraid that I will take charge of the church s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Instead, nearly every elder feels that he understands the truth and has clear insight; therefore, he is strict to carry things out.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is possible to carry out the truth and not follow the operation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The elders may ask whether this means that they should not carry things out according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should be clear that if we do not carry things out according to the truth, we are not obeying the operation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In many situations it is better to make a decision to not make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When we do not make a decision, it means that we still have some inward consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This gives the Spirit an opportunity to operate within us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Our concern is that many brothers shut the door to the Spirit s operation as soon as they become elders.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Those who give themselves to be full-timers should never have the thought that there is a group of co-workers who approve and decide whether one is qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>That would be centralized authority, and such a practice is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Those who desire to serve full time should have the approval of the elders in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We need to turn the cake.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We are concerned that in considering the saints who have a heart to serve full time, some elders will function in a habitual way of doing things, not according to their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>They might not be in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The consideration of the saints in such a way is organizational, not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>In other words, we are concerned that the elders will not follow the Spirit but will merely consider outward qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>For the past two thousand years this problem has caused the church to not grow much and to not be useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This problem has also forced the church to rely on organization.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It seems that if the church does not rely on organization, it cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The genuine church, however, cannot be in organization.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We need to be organic, but we do not have enough growth in life or the habit of being organic.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Therefore, what we do still lacks an organic element.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This is our greatest problem.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>My burden is that every saint would have a heart to fear the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The elders must learn to fear the Lord in every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>They should fear the Lord not merely concerning playing mah-jongg but also in following the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The elders in the churches fear the Lord in many aspects of their living; however, in following the operation of the Spirit to obey the anointing and the sense of life, they do not fear Him enough.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Most of their decisions are based on what is right or wrong and good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Our consideration of those who wish to serve full time must not be based on what is good or bad or on who is qualified or not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We must be fearful before the Lord and learn to follow the Spirit by obeying the anointing and the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>What the elders do according to the Spirit will not have the flavor of exercising authority or controlling others, because the Spirit is living and not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>When we asked the elders in every locality to consider those who desire to serve full time, we did not use the word examine.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This means that we asked the elders to consider the situation of every applicant.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>This does not mean that they have the authority to accept or reject anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>If we were an organization, it would be easy to carry things out according to rules.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>However, we are a living organism.</S>
