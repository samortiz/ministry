   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e Two Wells Two Sources of Living</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first section of this chapter, we have two seeds, two kinds of persons, and two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without the second section, however, we can see neither the source nor the result of their living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the second section we have two wells, one for Ishmael vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>14-21 and one for Isaac vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>22-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the Bible does not waste any words, this record of two wells for two kinds of lives must be very meaningful and full of spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 The Well for Ishmael</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>a In the Wilderness Close to Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ishmael's well, the source of his living, was in the wilderness close to Egypt vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>19-21; 25:12, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Bible, the wilderness always represents a place rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God never accepts the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we are in the wilderness, we are rejected by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The best illustration of this is the wandering in the wilderness by the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In figure, the wilderness also signifies our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we live in our soul, we are straying in the wilderness that is rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The wilderness where Ishmael's well was located was close to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He could easily drift from there into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that when we are in our soul, in our natural being, we are wandering in the wilderness and can easily drift into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>b Making Ishmael an Archer</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ishmael's source of living made him an archer v. 20 . The difference between an archer and a planter is that a planter grows life and an archer kills it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An archer is a wild hunter like Nimrod in 10:8-12, a killer in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This section of the Word even uses the word "bowshot" to describe the distance between the place where Hagar was sitting and the place where she had cast her child vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, in this portion of the Word, it is revealed that if we stay in the wilderness of our soul and drink water out of the well for Ishmael, the source of his living, we shall be made an archer using the bow to kill life for building up our own kingdom, not a planter growing life for the building up of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>c Leading to the Joining to Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ishmael's source of living eventually joined him to Egypt, that is, to the world v. 21 . When Hagar took a wife for Ishmael, she took a wife from Egypt, from her own source.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being an Egyptian, she desired to have an Egyptian woman as her daughter-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By taking a wife out of the land of Egypt for Ishmael, Hagar sealed him with the things of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We see from all this that there is a well, a source of living, which can make us a wild hunter who kills life and can join us to the world.</S>
