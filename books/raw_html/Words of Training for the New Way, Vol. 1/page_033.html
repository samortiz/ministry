 <h2 class="head1">AN ILLUSTRATION FROM THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Salvation Having Been Prepared</h2>
<p>Now I would use an illustration from the Bible to show you that matters of spiritual life are normal matters. Romans 10:6 says, &ldquo;But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? That is, to bring Christ down.&rdquo; This portion of the word means that for our salvation, Christ needed to come down from heaven. But no one can ascend to heaven to bring Christ down. Furthermore, there was no need to bring Him down because He had already come down. Verse 7 then says, &ldquo;Or, Who will descend into the abyss? That is, to bring Christ up from among the dead.&rdquo; The abyss is Hades. No one can cause Christ to come down from heaven, and then to descend to the abyss, and be resurrected from the dead. Christ has already accomplished all this for us. In other words, no one can do this thing; and neither is there any need for someone to do it, because Christ has already accomplished this for us. God has already prepared everything of His salvation for us. This can be compared to God preparing air for human beings on the earth, so that once a person is born, with a cry he can breathe the air into him. Today, if a person wants to be saved, he only needs to open his mouth and call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Then he will obtain salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ as the Word Being in Man&rsquo;s Mouth<br />
and in Man&rsquo;s Heart</h2>
<p>Therefore, verse 8 continues, &ldquo;But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.&rdquo; The &ldquo;it&rdquo; in this verse is &ldquo;the righteousness&rdquo; (in v. 6) which is &ldquo;the word.&rdquo; This refers to Christ. This word of the Apostle Paul was spoken to those who had heard the gospel, but had not yet called on the Lord to be saved. After a person hears the gospel, before he calls on the Lord and believes, Christ is already in his mouth and in his heart. As soon as he calls, he will be saved.</p>
<p>When you go out to knock on doors to preach the gospel, you should tell those who are listening to the gospel, &ldquo;Christ is now in your mouth and in your heart.&rdquo; Although it is very difficult for people to comprehend this word, it is nevertheless a very normal matter because Christ has already accomplished everything, and through the word He has supplied everything. Today Christ is so wonderful that He is beyond our understanding. He has a person and a personality, but He is also like the air. This Christ is the righteousness of God to be our righteousness; hence, He needs to be received by us. For this, He needs to be the word, because only as the word are we able to hear and to receive Him. Once this Christ who is the word is heard by you, even though you have not yet believed in Him nor called on Him, He is already in your mouth and in your heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to tell those who have heard the gospel and have not yet believed, &ldquo;Friend, I am here to tell you some good news. You need the Savior. Although now you have not believed in Him yet, this Savior, along with the word of the gospel that you heard, has come into you already. As I am here speaking to you, He is in your mouth and in your heart. If you do not believe, the matter of salvation will still not be accomplished in you; however, as soon as you believe, the matter of salvation will be accomplished in you. This is just like the air being here. If you do not breathe, nothing will happen; as soon as you take a breath, the air comes into you. Today, for you to be saved is too simple a matter. There is no need to speak to the heavens and ask who will bring Christ down from heaven. Neither is there the need to speak to the earth and ask who will bring Christ up from beneath. The Christ that you need is now in your mouth and in your heart. You simply call on His name now! As soon as you call on His name, you will be saved. This is a very normal and easy matter.&rdquo;</p>
