[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Zech 1:1-6
[2]  For their suffering of His punishment, God sent Christ as His Angel to be with them and go with them through their captivity, who accomplished a fine redemption for their salvation.
[3]  We need to make a comparison between the three prophets, Isaiah, Daniel, and Zechariah, in two matters: in God's economy toward His chosen people and in Christ for the people of His concern.
[4]  B. In Christ for the People of God's Concern 1.
[5]  The book of Isaiah unveils Christ in many items, mainly concerning Christ's being, that is, concerning what Christ is.
[6]  Regarding Christ for the people of God's concern, in Isaiah we see that Christ is ushered in as the all-inclusive One to meet the need of the chastised Israel and of the judged nations.
[7]  4 ; the vision of the flying scroll 5:1-4 ; the vision of the ephah vessel 5:5-11 ; the vision of the four chariots 6:1-8 ; and the concluding word to confirm the eight visions by the crowning of Joshua as a type of Christ, who will build the temple of God and will hold two offices the priesthood and the kingship in peace on His throne 6:9-15 .
[8]  The Man here is the Angel of Jehovah v. 11a . The Angel of Jehovah is Jehovah Himself as the Triune God Exo 3:2a, 4-6, 13-15 . The Angel of Jehovah is also Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 and as the sent One of God John 5:36-38; 6:38-39 . The Angel of Jehovah is also the Angel of God who escorted and protected Israel on their way from Egypt to the promised land Exo 23:20; 32:34; Judg.
[9]  Here we see that the red, reddish- brown, and white horses, signifying those among Israel who were to be redeemed and brought back to God for His justification and acceptance, had been sent by Jehovah to go to and fro on the earth; and they answered the Angel of Jehovah standing among the myrtle trees that they had gone to and fro on the earth and had seen that all the earth sat still and was quiet.
[10]  These verses reveal that in addition to Christ, who had been sent as the Redeemer to take care of Israel in their captivity, others had been sent by God to go through the earth to see the situation of the nations.
[11]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE THREE THE VISIONS OF CONSOLATION AND PROMISE 2 Scripture Reading: Zech 2
[12]  In this message we come to chapter two of Zechariah, which is a very mysterious chapter.
[13]  "I will be her wall of fire round about, declares Jehovah, and I will be the glory within her" v. 5 . Here we see that the wall of the city of Jerusalem and the glory within her are Jehovah Himself, indicating that Jehovah will be the protection of Jerusalem at her circumference and her glory at her center.
[14]  In the New Jerusalem the Triune God in Christ will be the glory at its center Rev 21:23; 22:1, 5 , and this glory will shine through the transparent wall to be its protection of fire Rev 21:18 .
[15]  "I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me" v. 30 . "The works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me" v. 36b . "The Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me" v. 37a . "I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me" 6:38 . "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him" v. 44a . "The living Father has sent Me" v. 57a . Zechariah 2 and John 5 and 6 all speak of the Father's sending the Son.
[16]  This vision is for the strengthening and assuring of the returned captives regarding the rebuilding of the temple of God in their distress.
[17]  The Perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah
[18]  In His charge to Joshua, Christ as the Angel of Jehovah said, "Thus says Jehovah of hosts, If you will walk in My ways and if you will keep My charge, then you will both judge My house and keep My courts, and I will grant you to walk among these standing here."
[19]  Zechariah 3:9 goes on to say, "For behold, this is the stone that I have set before Joshua: upon one stone are seven eyes.
[20]  Furthermore, Jehovah will remove the iniquity of that land in one day v. 9c . This indicates that the Christ on whom God has worked will redeem the sin of the land of Israel in one day, the day of His crucifixion 1 Pet 2:24 . Through His death on the cross, Christ the Lamb of God took away the sin of the world John 1:29 .
[21]  In this message we will consider the vision of consolation and promise in chapter four of Zechariah.
[22]  The priesthood of Joshua signifies the priesthood of the nation of Israel for the nations for God.
[23]  God's intention was to use the nation of Israel as a priesthood to bring the nations to God that they might enter into God's presence to be enlightened, exposed, dealt with, and transfused by God with the divine riches.
[24]  The two sons of oil are also the two witnesses in the last three and a half years of the present age, who will be witnesses of God in the great tribulation for the strengthening of God's peoples the Israelites and the believers in Christ Rev 11:3-12; 12:17 .
[25]  In the first five visions which Zechariah saw 1:7 4:14 , God spoke a comforting, consoling, and encouraging word to Joshua, Zerubbabel, and the people.
[26]  Verse 3a says, "Then he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of all the land."
[27]  The visions are confirmed by the crowning of Joshua the high priest typifying Christ in His priesthood linked with Zerubbabel the governor of Judah, typifying Christ as the Shoot of David in His kingship, to hold the two offices, the priesthood and the kingship, in peace on His throne vv.
[28]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE EIGHT THE ADVICE TO ISRAEL TO TURN
[29]  Israel was advised not only to turn from the vanity of their ritualistic religion but also to turn to the reality of a godly life.
[30]  The situation of Jerusalem in the restoration will be so pleasant that it will be wonderful both in the sight of the remnant of Israel and in the sight of Jehovah v. 6 . When the people see the pleasantness of Jerusalem, they may say, "This is wonderful!" and God may say, "Yes, this is wonderful!"
[31]  In those days, from all the languages of the nations, ten men will take hold of the skirt of a Jewish man, saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you" v. 23; Isa 2:2-3a . In some way God will reverse the situation of Babel and deal with the problem caused by the different languages among the nations.
[32]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE NINE THE PROPHECIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT 1 Scripture Reading: Zech 9
[33]  Zechariah's burden was to help the returned people of Israel to see God's purpose.
[34]  D. The Millennial Kingdom as a Time of Restoration
[35]  Verse 10 says, "I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim / And the horse from Jerusalem, / And the battle bow will be cut off; / And He will speak peace unto the nations, / And His dominion will be from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth."
[36]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE TEN THE PROPHECIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT 2 Scripture Reading: Zech 10
[37]  "Jehovah of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, / And will make them like His horse of majesty in battle" Zech 10:3b .
[38]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE ELEVEN THE PROPHECIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT 3 Scripture Reading: Zech 11
[39]  In this message we will consider the prophecy in chapter eleven of Zechariah.
[40]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE TWELVE THE PROPHECIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT 4 Scripture Reading: Zech 12:1-9; 14:1-7, 12-15
[41]  The Christ unveiled in the book of Zechariah is a Christ who is intimately involved with human history.
[42]  In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said clearly that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit.
[43]  To worship God is just to contact God, to receive God, to enjoy God, and to experience God.
[44]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE PROPHECIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT 5 Scripture Reading: Zech 12:10-14; 13:1-9
[45]  Romans 11:25b says that a hardness has come upon Israel in part until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in. In the present time, God seemingly has forsaken Israel, and Israel has become somewhat hard.
[46]  But when God pours out the Spirit of grace upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, many thousands of Israel, even the entire race of Israel, will be saved.
[47]  Repentant Israel will wail over Christ as the only Son of God and will cry bitterly over Him as the firstborn Son of God.
[48]  In the New Testament Christ is revealed first as the only begotten Son of God and then as the firstborn Son of God.
[49]  Christ's becoming the firstborn Son through death and resurrection is for us to become sons of God as heirs to inherit all the riches of what God is, that is, to receive, participate in, and enjoy all the riches of the Triune God.
[50]  Coming as the God-sent Shepherd to the Children of Israel
[51]  Christ, the Fellow of Jehovah, came as the God-sent Shepherd to the children of Israel but was attacked unto death by them v. 7a; Matt 9:36; John 10:11; Matt 26:31; Acts 2:23 . Zechariah 13:7a says, "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, / And against the man who is My Fellow, / Declares Jehovah of hosts.
[52]  This indicates that in His preparation God reacted to the rejection of Christ by the children of Israel and turned His hand upon them as the little ones by punishing them through Titus the Roman prince and his army in A.D. 70 and scattering them into the nations to be despised, humiliated, persecuted, and destroyed throughout the age of grace until today Matt 21:41a; 23:38; 24:2 .
[53]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE PROPHECIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT 6 Scripture Reading: Zech 14:8-11, 16-21
[54]  The center of the prophecies in chapters twelve through fourteen is Christ as the rejected Messiah coming back to be enthroned.
[55]  Everyone left from all the nations that went forth against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles v. 16 . Whoever does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there will be no rain, but there will be the plague with which Jehovah strikes the nations.
[56]  I. OF THE THINGS CONCERNING HUMAN GOVERNMENT A. In the Book of Daniel
[57]  In Daniel the great human image signifies the entire human government on earth as a skeleton ch.
[58]  The book of Zechariah reveals many things concerning Christ.
[59]  First, the redeeming Christ, as a man and as the Angel of Jehovah, the embodiment of the Triune God, was sent by God to be with His humiliated people of Israel in their captivity, signified by the myrtle trees in the bottoms 1:8-11 .
[60]  Then Christ, as a man in His humanity, was the One sent by Jehovah of hosts and was also the Sender, Jehovah of hosts, dealing with the nations who plundered the people of Zion and touched them as touching the pupil of His eye 2:1, 8-10 .
[61]  Following this, Christ was the Servant of Jehovah and the Shoot to be the stone with seven eyes engraved by God for the removing of the iniquity of the holy land for the building of the temple of God 3:8-9 .
[62]  Christ as the King of Israel came into Jerusalem lowly and riding upon a donkey, even upon a colt 9:9 , yet Christ as the Shepherd of God's elect was rejected and sold at the price of a slave, thirty pieces of silver 11:12-13 .
[63]  Christianity is a totality of organization, but the church revealed in the Bible should be absolutely organic and full of Christ as life, full of the Triune God in His consummation the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit to constitute us with God's life and nature and to join us with God as one spirit.
[64]  LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE FIFTEEN A WORD CONCERNING THE HUMAN SPIRIT
[65]  AND THE CHRIST UNVEILED IN ZECHARIAH Scripture Reading: Zech 12:1; Isa 42:5-6; John 4:24; 2 Tim 4:22; Zech 3:9; Rev 5:6; Zech 1:8-11, 20-21; 2:1-2, 5, 8-9, 11; 4:7, 2-3, 11-14; 9:9; 11:7-13; 14:9, 16-17; 4:9; 6:12-15, 1
[66]  The book of Zechariah reveals that Christ is wonderful and that He is the centrality and universality of God's economy.
[67]  The Lord Jesus said to her, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" v. 14 . When she asked Him to give her this water, He told her to go and call her husband vv.
[68]  However, she immediately turned the conversation to the matter of worship, saying, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" v. 20 . The Lord Jesus replied, "An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father....But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness...God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness" vv.
[69]  In the first of the five visions concerning Christ, Christ is unveiled as the Man as the Angel of Jehovah riding on a red horse and standing among the myrtle trees 1:7-17 .
[70]  20-21 Christ is the last Craftsman used by God to break the four horns Babylon, Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire which damaged and destroyed the chosen people of God vv.
[71]  The last six chapters of Zechariah are divided into two groups: chapters nine through eleven, which speak of Christ's lowly first coming, and chapters twelve through fourteen, which speak of Christ's victorious second coming.
[72]  In His first coming, Christ came as a lowly King and was temporarily welcomed as the King into Jerusalem in a lowly form.
[73]  Although the two mountains of brass do not signify Christ, they are nevertheless closely related to Christ, for He has been appointed by God to carry out the judgment upon the living and the dead John 5:22; Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim 4:1 .
