   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It seems that the Lord spoke in John 14 without caring whether the disciples understood Him or not.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I do not believe that any of the twelve understood what He was talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord said that when He spoke, the Father who abode in Him did His works v. 10 . The Lord went on to say, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever" v. 16 . Eventually, He said, "The Spirit of reality...abides with you and shall be in you....In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shows that the Spirit's being in the disciples is the Son's being in them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This brief fellowship gives us an overview of the first twenty verses of John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the secret of the mystery of these twenty verses?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The secret is that the three of the Triune God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible scholars in the early church pointed out that God is triune, three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In mathematics there is not such a figure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who understands what three-one is?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some teachers added the preposition in, saying that God is three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Something that is three in one must be some kind of compound.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Three elements are compounded together to be one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To illustrate this we may consider water with tea and lemon added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These three elements are compounded together to be lemon tea.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This may be a good illustration, but no illustration is adequate to explain the mystery of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Divine Trinity is beyond the realm of human understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We simply have to take the scriptural revelation of the Triune God and experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not long after I was saved, I began to meet with a group of Brethren believers who taught strongly that we should pray to the Father in the name of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They gave verses as a basis for their teaching, and I accepted it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I tried to practice what they taught.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Formerly when I prayed, I simply said "Lord Jesus" or "Father" without thinking about whom I was addressing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After being taught that I should pray to the Father in the name of the Son, I corrected myself when I did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, I was so bothered that it became difficult for me to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They stressed strongly that the Lord Jesus told us to ask the Father in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in my experience, whenever I prayed, the Father was there, the Son was there, and the Spirit was there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In my writing, I may need three helpers to assist me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes I need number one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then after five minutes, I need number two.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A little later I need number three.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have to make three phone calls to get these three helpers, but with the three in the Godhead, we do not need to make three calls.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When one is here, all three are here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our God is the three-one God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Third of the Divine Trinity, and the Third today is the consummation of the three.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you have the Third, you have the Second and the First.</S>
