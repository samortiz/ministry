[1]  IF ANYONE SINS Scripture Reading: John 5:14; 8:11; Rom 6:1-2; Num 19:1-10, 12-13, 17-19; 1 John 1:7 2:2
[2]  After the man was healed the Lord met him in the temple and said to him, "Behold, you have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you" v. 14 . John 8 speaks of the Lord Jesus forgiving a woman who had committed adultery.
[3]  He said to her then and there, "From now on sin no more" v. 11 . Once we are saved, we are charged by the Lord to sin no more! As saved ones, we surely should not continue in sin.
[4]  To take care of this matter, we must first realize that the Lord Jesus has borne all our sins on the cross.
[5]  All the sins which we have committed, as well as those we are committing and will commit during our whole life, were borne by the Lord on the cross.
[6]  After the red heifer was killed, it was burned.
[7]  The skin, the flesh, the blood, and the dung were all burned.
[8]  When we sin and when we know our sin and acknowledge it as sin, God will forgive us our sin and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[9]  First John 2:1 says, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin."
[10]  John wrote these things to us so that we may not sin.
[11]  It shows us that the Lord has forgiven our many sins and that, as a result, we do not sin.
[12]  When we find out that we are forgiven, we do not become free to sin; rather, we will not sin.
[13]  When a child of God sins and does not confess his sin but instead remains in his sin, he loses his fellowship with God.
