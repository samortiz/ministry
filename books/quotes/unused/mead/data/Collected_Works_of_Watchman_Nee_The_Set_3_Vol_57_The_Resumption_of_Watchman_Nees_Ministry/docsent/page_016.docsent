   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE WAY OF THE CHURCH Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 11, 1948, Lord's Day afternoon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT The Tabernacle and the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Typifying Two Aspects of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the question of the desolation of the church, we must first consider the way of the church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way of the church on earth can be seen from the history of the tabernacle in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The tabernacle in the Old Testament was set up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The purpose of the tabernacle was for God to dwell with His people Israel Exo 25:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are many basic differences between the temple and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the beginning God dwelt in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the temple was finished, God began to dwell in the temple 1 Kings 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both the tabernacle and the temple typify God's dwelling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two appear to be repetitions in type.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, they are not repetitions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past many people have written books concerning the tabernacle as a type.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But few books have been written concerning the temple as a type.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, both are types of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet there are some basic differences between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Tabernacle in the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being Temporary and Movable,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>whereas the Temple in the Holy Land</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being Eternal and Stable</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The tabernacle was built in the wilderness under the direction of Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The temple was prepared by David and completed by Solomon in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The tabernacle did not have a floor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It had a cover and curtains.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When a person entered the tabernacle, his feet touched the sand on the ground, reminding him that the tabernacle was something transitory and movable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why it was called the tabernacle, or "the tent of meeting.''</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The temple had many similarities to the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the tabernacle, there were gold, silver, brass, and iron.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the temple there were the wood and the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The stones were a crucial material.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Testament the Lord called Peter, Cephas John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word Cephas means a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the tabernacle there was no stone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Stones are immovable; they signify stability and solidarity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tabernacle was designed for the wilderness; it was transitory in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The temple was designed for the kingdom; it was eternal in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>David represents the Lord, and Solomon represents the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The meaning of Solomon is the One who brings in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God sent the Holy Spirit of peace to build up the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>David is a type of the incarnated Christ, and Solomon is a type of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Tabernacle Typifying God's Church on Earth,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>whereas the Temple Typifying the Church</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>as Christ's Unique Body</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Bible there are always two aspects to God's habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, it is transitory and wandering, typified by the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tabernacle moved as the people traveled along.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes it was in Elim.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At other times it was in Kadesh-barnea.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes it was in the land of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At other times it was in the land of bitter water.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the tabernacle itself did not change with a change of location.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Wherever the Israelites pitched their tents, there was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, the tabernacle typifies God's church on earth, or His church in the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Shanghai there is the church, because in Shanghai there are God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever God's people come together, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When they are separated, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the aspect of the church as typified by the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The temple was different from the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The temple was established on the threshingfloor of Ornan 2 Chron 3:1 and built with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was built for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was the center of the life of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The temple was unique, eternal, and solid, and it could not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even when the nation was divided politically, the temple could not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There could be only one temple.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>From this we see that, on the one hand, the church appears in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet the spiritual reality of the church is still one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is unique and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These are the two pictures of the church.</S>
