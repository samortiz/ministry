   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING CARE OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the entire Bible there is not another verse like 2 Timothy 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 15 through 17 say, From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostle Paul wrote these words purposefully to indicate that when the church is in degradation, whoever desires to be a man of God, a godly man, must take care of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to know the Bible from our youth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The way to conduct ourselves in the church is by taking care of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hope that an atmosphere of loving the Bible will be built up in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone in the Lord s recovery should be a Bible lover, always eating, reading, and studying the word of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way to conduct ourselves in the church life is to know the Bible to the extent that others would call us a Bible man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not know the Bible, we will not know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If possible, we should read three chapters of the Old Testament and one chapter of the New Testament every day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way we can easily read the whole Bible once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to build up such a good habit in order to be a godly person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If some young brothers come to my home one day and see that I read many secular magazines and newspapers, they will not think that I am godly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They may think instead that I am worldly and perhaps that I am fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether or not we read the newspaper should not be a legal matter, but it is a spiritual fact that if we spend too much time reading worldly publications, we may be led into the indulgence of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather than spending much time reading worldly publications, we should redeem the time by reading the word of our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way to conduct ourselves in the church is by becoming someone who loves the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not make the excuse that we were not born with the kind of disposition necessary to be such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have all been reborn with the same life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we all can study the Bible daily and diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should try to read through the Bible once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, we should spend at least ten minutes every morning to pray-read two or three verses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we pray-read, the more nourishment we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to eat the word every day to receive the nourishment and become constituted with the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we practice this, we will always impress others with godliness, and this will be a glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If this is our daily testimony and this governs our walk in the church life, we will know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By reading the Bible day after day, we will accumulate much knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Based on this knowledge of God s Word, we will know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to spend time before the Lord to consider the principles we have seen that should govern our conduct in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to pray about these principles and by the Lord s grace put them all into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BEING PREPARED AS SHEPHERDS AND TEACHERS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s recovery will spread not in the way of a movement but in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we all grow in life, the churches will increase and spontaneously spread to other cities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wherever the churches spread, there is the need of some to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, many saints, especially the young ones, need to spend time to study the Word of God, to be saturated and thoroughly constituted with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then they will be prepared to teach the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the New Testament, teaching is the proper shepherding, for Ephesians 4:11 lists shepherds and teachers as one class of gifted person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not know how to teach, we cannot shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Shepherding is based on teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, 1 Timothy 5:17 reveals that teaching is the main function of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to be qualified as an elder to bear responsibility in a local church, we must be able to teach 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we can teach, we will be able to shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, if the young ones study God s Word to be thoroughly saturated and constituted with the Word in the coming years, many of them will be good teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then they will spontaneously become good shepherds and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the way that the leadership is prepared for the spread of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose the young people in a locality come together only to have a good time, playing the guitar, singing hymns, and releasing their spirit, but they do not spend time in the Word of God and are not exercised in the spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Several years may pass, yet nothing will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a situation would be worse than the situation in denominational Christianity, for Christianity at least has seminaries to train some leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To only have a good time is a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to come to the church meetings to learn something, to be built up, and to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should mean business in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord s testimony is the most important thing in our life today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we need to spend our time, our energy, and even our being to be constituted for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I encourage all the saints to spend a solid time to enter into the solid things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not relax or only seek to have a good time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church life is not for a good time; it is for something solid.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to pick up this burden and go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not use the excuse that we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are all weak, but He who is in us is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not have the energy in ourselves, but His grace is sufficient for us 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all need to look to the Lord for His grace that we may come up to His standard.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that all the saints will legally spend time in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we all practice this, the church life will be healthy, strong, rich, and genuinely living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all need to honor the headship of Christ, bear the truth, exercise ourselves unto godliness, take care of the healthy teaching, and study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By spending time in the Word, we will be filled with the knowledge of the divine Word and will know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God.</S>
