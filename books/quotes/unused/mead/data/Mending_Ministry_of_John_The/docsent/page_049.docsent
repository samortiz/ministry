   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCHES FIRST IN JOHN'S FINAL WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we come to the last part of a writing, we know that we have the final word of the author.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can see this in John's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In his Gospel we do not have much sense of being in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same is true of his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With Revelation, however, we are at least at the front door of the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are not in, we can at least stretch our necks and look around!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What a view!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How much is going on!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are sitting before a universally wide television screen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can see Christ's ministry in the heavens, this ministry which is now being carried out on earth by John's mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this final book there are twenty-two chapters, but only three positive major things are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first is the local churches, represented by the seven golden lampstands chapters one to three .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second is the open heavens chapters four to twenty , unveiling God's universal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The last is the New Jerusalem chapters twenty-one to twenty-two , the ultimate consummation of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is interesting that Revelation begins with the golden lampstands, the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I used to consider why John did not first show us the heavens opened, with God sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This seemed more logical, since Christ has ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then he could portray for us how Christ came forward, took the scroll of the new testament, and opened it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After that scene, the view of the churches could follow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John chose to show us the churches before unveiling the open heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is an indication that the churches come before the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The churches are better than the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they are not above the heavens, at least they are before the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where are the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may answer that the churches are in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This answer is only partially true.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the churches are only in the heavens, then the church is no greater than the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the churches are superior to the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why do I say this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually God will leave the heavens and stay in the consummation of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Revelation 21 we are told that the New Jerusalem, God's tabernacle, comes down out of heaven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>3, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God comes to stay with His chosen people, who are the components of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not realize how precious the church is to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are in Him and in the church, yet we do not have much appreciation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is homesick in the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be homesick is to be away from home and to keep thinking about home and to long to be there instead of somewhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is in the heavens, but that is not His home.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He longs to be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are His home.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John places the churches before the heavens because in his speaking, as in God's, the most treasured thing is the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In God's consideration the churches have the preeminence in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first item in God's seeing is the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The book of Revelation is the final word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In His final word, the churches come first.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some day you will realize that there is nothing in the whole earth, even in the whole universe, more precious to God than the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>CHRIST IN THE MIDST OF THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Revelation 2 and 3 Christ is shown walking in the midst of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How many churches are there on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The seven mentioned here are representative of all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If He is walking in the midst of seven churches, He is surely walking in the midst of all of them!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are here from several different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do you realize that the Lord Jesus has often been in your locality, walking in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord has often been here to visit the church in New York!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He has passed again and again through Newton, Miami, and Goldsboro!</S>
