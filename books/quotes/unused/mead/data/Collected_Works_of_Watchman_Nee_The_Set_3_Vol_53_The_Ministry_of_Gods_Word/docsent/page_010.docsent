   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRANSMITTING OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since God's word is full of human elements, He also includes man in the transmission of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since God's word is full of human elements, God cannot use a tape recorder, thunder, lightning, or angels to communicate His word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Human elements must be involved in the communication of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the content is so full of human elements, God must convey it through human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not a matter of receiving a voice from God and then sending this voice out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's word has to pass through our spirit and even our mind, feelings, and understanding and then be converted into our own words before it can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what it means to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not a matter of receiving His word with one hand and sending it out with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That is not the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we receive a word from God and send out the same word verbatim, we are acting merely as a recording machine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God does not want us to transmit His word like a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He wants us to receive the word and then dwell on it, feel it, be bothered by it, rejoice over it, and chew on it before sending it out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 7:37 says, "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I am thirsty, I can go to the Lord and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the matter does not stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 38 the Lord said, "He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I am thirsty, I can go to the Lord Jesus and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if others are in need, can I simply pour a drink for them?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No, God's Word says that after a man takes a drink, the water goes into his innermost being and then rivers of living water flow out of his innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ministry of the word is God's word coming into us and then flowing out from our innermost being to quench others' thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indirect route constitutes the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not a matter of how many verses we can recite or how many messages we can deliver.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a matter of the living water making an indirect turn and flowing out of our innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The need for a turning within our innermost being and a subsequent flowing out from within our inner being tells us that a price is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes the living water flows into us but cannot flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At other times, it ceases to be living after coming into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Still at other times, many impurities from our inner being are carried with it when it flows out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When this happens, we do not have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ministry of the word has nothing to do with well-prepared sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the word comes into us, it grinds and churns within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When it passes through us in this way, human elements are added to the word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word is not contaminated or damaged; it is enhanced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the meaning of having the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord is making us channels of living water; water has to flow out from our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our innermost being is the channel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for the living water to flow out of us, our very being has to be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are not proper, God's word cannot come out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not think that the power of a message comes from intelligence or eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No, intelligence and eloquence are not the point.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The point is whether or not our human elements will enhance and complete God's word when it passes through us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Does the word become human while still being divine, or do we damage God's word when our human elements are added to it?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the basic question that faces a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A big problem with many people is that the living water ceases to be living when it passes through their innermost being!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why we emphasize the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man does not see the importance of being dealt with by the Lord and if his habits, character, and living are not dealt with, he will be useless as far as God's word is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man thinks that being a minister of the word is merely a matter of eloquence and cleverness, he is far from the truth!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In fact, nothing can be farther from the truth!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's word must first come to us, pass through us, fill us, and even bother us, grind us, rub us, and deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must first suffer these trials and pay this price before we can be brought to the clear realization of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way God's word is added to us little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is assembled in us and woven into us stitch by stitch like a quilt.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then when the word comes out of us, it will involve the release of the spirit, not just the repetition of words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The water that comes forth will be clear and pure, fully proceeding out from God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will only enhance its perfection; we will not mar its perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will only add to its holiness, not diminish it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we are released, the living water will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As we are speaking, God will also be speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the meaning of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ministry of the word is like a combined flow of two rivers; it is not a single river.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order for this to happen, the Holy Spirit needs to operate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need the Spirit to direct our environment to discipline us in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the Holy Spirit works on us, breaks us, dismantles us, and molds us, we are formed into a channel through which the living water can flow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our outer man has to be broken and dismantled by God; it needs to be thoroughly and drastically dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our spirit will acquire the understanding, and the Holy Spirit will have the freedom to release God's word through us only after the Holy Spirit has accomplished such a work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God's word will take up our human element, yet it will not be contaminated by our human element.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead, His word and our word will be a combined flow of two rivers.</S>
