<p>Praise the Lord that the life-giving Spirit is now moving in us, acting in us, and anointing us! The anointing of the Spirit may be compared to painting. As coat after coat of paint is applied to a chair, so through the anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit the divine element with the divine essence is applied to us. The Spirit within us is continually anointing us, continually &ldquo;painting&rdquo; us with the divine &ldquo;paint,&rdquo; the divine essence. The Holy Spirit as the ointment is the paint, and this paint includes the divine holiness and all the divine virtues and attributes. The anointing is the moving of this Spirit within us. This anointing is actually the dispensing. Whether we call this anointing or dispensing, this is a matter of the processed Triune God being applied to us in our experience. All we need to do is simply stay under this anointing, stay in this dispensing. Let us stay under the divine dispensing and get soaked with the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>Because our need is to be soaked with the Triune God, we should not make up our mind to improve ourselves. For example, we all have a problem with our temper. Do you think that you are an exception and that you have a good temper instead of a bad temper? The fact is that regarding the problem of temper, we are all the same. Just as frogs have a croaking life and dogs have a barking life, we have a temper-losing life. Do you know why you complain and get angry? You complain and get angry because you have that kind of life. Because we are what we are, we should not make up our minds to be different. A frog cannot stop croaking, a dog cannot stop barking, and we cannot improve our temper. This problem is rooted in our nature. Instead of trying to change your nature, simply receive the divine anointing, the divine dispensing, from the Lord. Keep yourself open to this dispensing. If you continually receive the divine dispensing, it will overcome your temper.</p>
<p>Actually, to overcome our temper or our besetting sins is not in itself a great matter. What is truly a great matter is for us to be saturated with the divine element through the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REAL SANCTIFICATION AND TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>This saturation with the divine element through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity is real sanctification and transformation. Eventually, this dispensing will issue in conformation and consummate in glorification. This means that through the divine dispensing we shall be like Christ. Hallelujah, we shall be like Him not only in glory outwardly, but also with the divine element inwardly! We shall be the same as He in element, essence, and substance. This will be the result of being saturated with Him. Year by year and day by day, we need to be soaked with the divine element. This is the experience of the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPREADING ONE</h2>
<p>Romans 8:10 says that because Christ is in us, our spirit is life. According to verse 6, if our mind is set on the spirit, the mind will also become life. Furthermore, according to verse 11, if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us, this One will give life to our mortal body. These verses indicate that the soaking, the saturating, begins with our spirit, spreads to our mind, and eventually reaches our mortal body. Hallelujah, our spirit is life! Our mind can also be life, and our body can receive life.</p>
<p>The dispensing God is also the spreading One. He spreads Himself from our spirit to our mind, and through our mind into our body. Our God is living not only on the throne in the heavens; He is also living in us, in our being. He is spreading Himself into every part of our being and saturating us with Himself until we are fully soaked with all that He is. How glorious! This is God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<p>The goal of God&rsquo;s salvation is to make us sons of God so that we may be the living members of the Body of His Son, Jesus Christ. Hallelujah for the dispensing of the Divine Trinity! Hallelujah for the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> </body></html>
