   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH CHILDREN Choosing God for the Children, and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Provoking Them to Anger</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a family, in addition to the wife, there is another group of people who are hard to deal with the children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How should we deal with our children?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First we have to choose God for them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Freedom of religion can be practiced only after they have moved away from home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as they are at home, we have to choose their faith for them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to be firm in our attitude on the one hand and gentle on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The mistake that fathers often make toward their children is provoking them to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 6:4 says that the fathers should not provoke their children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the head we have the authority, but we must not provoke our children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Except for Colossians 3, this is the only place in the Bible that teaches how to be a father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is easy to be a father foolishly, but exercising authority and firmly dealing with children is not that easy; the children can easily rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being a Pattern, Nurturing Up the Children</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 6:4 also mentions nurturing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means bringing up someone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose I asked Brother Wu to bring a letter to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is different from sending a letter to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Bringing a letter is having a person go with a letter, whereas sending a letter is having the letter go without the person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose you bring your son to Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are going together with your son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is different from sending your son to Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible says that we should "bring up" our children with the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that the fathers have to take the lead in the teachings and the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many fathers do not bring up their children; they hope that their children will not do certain things, yet they do the same things themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is sending up; this is not bringing up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Asking your children to follow your teachings while not practicing them yourself will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to bring them up until they are grown up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to be their pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever you want them to be, you must first be yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the way to deal with children.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE WAY TO DEAL WITH SLAVES</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 6:5 goes on to deal with the question of the slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It says, "Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether or not a person is a believer, he is either a servant or a master.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you have an unbeliever as your master, you must obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have a brother as your master, you have a double responsibility towards him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, you have to serve your Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the other hand, you have to serve your brother who is your master.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many families find it difficult to hire brothers and sisters as servants.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I would think that saints would do a better job than outsiders, but many brothers today would not hire believers to work for them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who are servants should serve their masters well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If I had to travel and needed a tent, I would surely have bought it from Paul in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I would surely want his signature to be on the tent that I bought.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If Paul could not make better tents than others, I would not read his epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His needlework had to be good and his craftsmanship excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the way the servants have to be; they must do a better job than those in the world could do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the same time, masters must know how to be masters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They must be loving, gentle, and humble towards their servants, and they must honor them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They must be firm in their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the servants do something wrong, they must ask them to do it over again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If they let them get by one time, the servants will not do a good job the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether you are a master or a servant, you have to be one "from the soul," knowing that each one will receive back what he has done, whether he is a slave or a free man, and also knowing that both their Master and yours is in the heavens; there is no respect of persons with Him vv.</S>
