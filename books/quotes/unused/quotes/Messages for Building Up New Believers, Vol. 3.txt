It covers the importance of this type of training, the main points to take care of, and some practical suggestions
We speak about recreation not because of our personal need, but because of the children in our family, that is, our next generation
If they do not have some kind of diversion, it is easy for them to become sick; their health can quickly deteriorate
We must acknowledge the need for a break and diversion in our lives, but we cannot make recreation our whole life
A man can turn away from his work to something else when he is tired, but he cannot pursue recreation all day long
Often a change in place, a solitary place in the hills or by a river, affords a person the necessary relief from his tiredness
It can teach a person about the geography and history of all the countries in the world, but it is a problem when one becomes ensnared by it
If we deprive them of their right to play, they will be bored and restless at home, and they will sneak away to do things behind our back
We want our children to set aside their time for the Lord, but we also need to take care of their need for diversion
It may not make any difference to us whether or not we play the piano, but it makes a great difference to a new believer
We allow people to have recreation for the purpose of increasing their work efficiency, but we must not give others any ground for criticism
We may say that the only kind of recreation that is proper is that which involves pure skill and nothing of chance
If an activity involves only chance and has nothing to do with skill, it is gambling, and Christians should turn away from it
Some birds can be kept because they have been domesticated for years and are like house pets; they would not live if they were freed
Sometimes an elderly brother may advise you to take some diversion because he can sense a buildup of tension within you
It is not only wrong to harm our body with improper activities, but also wrong to harm our body with proper activities
It is not wrong for the brother to be in the ball game, but it is wrong for the sister who has the heart disease to be in the game
If you ask them to water flowers for half an hour, they show no sign of fatigue, even though the same task may tire others out
If you ask a person who has an aversion for flowers and who hates gardening to water for half an hour, this will be a burden
You must choose the kind of recreation that matches your disposition so that it will restore your physical strength
If you choose something which goes against your disposition, you will feel tired and will not want to continue with it
No matter what our conviction is, we must take care of our influence on the young brothers when they see us doing what we are doing
It does not pose a problem if someone thinks that he can eat meat, but if his eating stumbles a brother, he should not eat
It is not enough to say that your conscience is at peace; you must remember that someone else's conscience may not be at peace
We may not necessarily do what they approve of, but we certainly will not do anything that they do not approve of
We may do many of the things which they approve of, and we will not do any of the things they do not approve of
Our standard must not be lower than the Gentiles' standard, especially when it comes to the matter of recreation
When they are among them, they may want to eat pork openly because they think that it is all right for Christians to eat pork
During this period of time, Stock Meyer was in Germany, Melton was in France, Andrew Murray was in Holland, and Evan Hopkins was in England
If you keep the proper principle of recreation before the Lord, recreation will uplift you and restore your body and mind to proper health
Once a person is saved and becomes God's child, the first lesson he needs to learn is to deal with his words before God
The most unfortunate thing in the whole world is for the satanic seed of lying to remain in the hearts of God's children
They withhold the things that are profitable to others, especially things that are profitable to their enemies, and remain silent about them
Such people speak certain things because they like to speak them, or they speak about certain persons because they like them
A person is lying when he is not speaking according to truth and reality but according to expectation and hope
At the most we can say that the fact indicates one thing but we have a different thought concerning the matter
A person who fears God, who has learned the proper lessons, and who has been dealt with by God will consider speaking a great thing
When you commit a word to a person who has not been dealt with or disciplined by the Lord, he will spread the word zealously
You cannot expect a person who is careless and capricious about his speaking to become an honest person overnight
If a brother spreads evil, critical, or sinful things all the time, we do not need to determine whether his words are true
We should never speak about things that do not concern us, and we should not say anything that reaps no benefit to others or to ourselves
A person who lies or who speaks idle and careless words is of little use to God; he is good only for the day of judgment
For 'he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile
Today the world argues about who said what first, but the Lord is concerned about whether or not one has spoken at all
The most outstanding characteristic of those who are undisciplined in their words is their desire to be teachers
Galatians 5 shows us what the fruit of the Spirit is, while James tells us what the mark of the fruit of the Spirit is
Many improper words in the church would disappear if all the brothers and sisters learned the lesson of listening
There are so many defiling words, criticisms, evil speakings, slanders, double-tongued speakings, because many people want to hear them
If God's children know the kinds of words they can and cannot speak, they will know the kinds of words they can and cannot hear
If you accept all kinds of lecherous words and do not consider them harmful, clearly you are a trash can; that is the kind of person you are
If a person is saying something improper to you, perhaps you should walk away quietly and leave the speaker to himself
If we keep on listening, hoping to learn a little more and to probe a little more, we are fanning the flame, not extinguishing it
A new believer must pay attention to this matter and must exercise considerable effort to deal with it from the very beginning
May God be gracious to us and have mercy on us so that we would learn to speak in a proper way from the very beginning
When sin came in, the first effect on man was the realization of his own nakedness; he felt ashamed immediately
When the priests went before God with the blood, the blood was applied to the thumb of the hand, the toe of the foot, and the ear
Today any shortening of sleeves or hems, or any clothing which exhibits rather than covers the body, is of the world
We look for covering and pray that our whole being would be fully covered by Him so that every part of our being would be redeemed and saved
According to the type in the Scripture, whatever is not covered by one's clothing must be covered by the blood
Other than the hands, feet, and head, every part of the body must be covered, and the hands, feet, and head must be covered with the blood
The completeness of the covering of our garment symbolizes the completeness of the covering we have received from the Lord
After the priest washed the garment and cut off the undesirable parts, if the leprosy stopped, the garment could be spared
Many of them can be worn again after the sleeves are lengthened and the dress dyed to a different color or changed to a different style
If a sister dresses herself in a careless, untidy, and unclean way, it means that she is a careless and loose person
Peter's emphasis is that sisters should not adorn themselves with the plaiting of hair and the putting on of gold and costly garments
A Christian should not wear clothes which provide an opportunity for heathens to say, 'Do Christians wear such things too'?
We have no intention, nor did Paul or Peter, to ask a sister to be careless, loose, or unconcerned about her attire
Other sisters do not care for the tidiness and the cleanliness of their attire; they are very careless about their clothing
If one does not pay attention to personal grooming and cleanliness, such a person is loose, sloppy, and careless
We should take note of one thing: No one should wear anything that draws attention to his clothes rather than to his person
In Genesis 3, after man fell, God gave man herbs for food and ordained that man would eat bread in the sweat of his face
When we come to Genesis 4, God put His seal of approval upon Abel but not Cain, even though no ordinance of any kind had yet been instituted
When we come to Genesis 9, God gave the animals to man for food , just as He had given fruit to man for food in the beginning
In addition to eating herbs, vegetables, and fruits, God ordained that man should take meat in order to live and survive
The basic principle with us is that since sin has entered the world, man can no longer have life without the sacrifice of life
Being a vegetarian is a subconscious declaration that we can live without death, that we can live without the shedding of blood
Those who eat meat should not judge those who do not, and those who do not eat meat should not judge those who do
Timothy 4 says that there will be the teachings of demons that forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods
Blood is not to be taken in the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of the law, or the dispensation of grace
In other words, God's ordinance regarding abstinence from blood tells us that there is only one redemption and one salvation
In Leviticus 17, as well as in other portions of the Old Testament, there is also an ordinance against eating strangled animals
Leviticus contains a list of ordinances regarding what is clean and what is unclean, and what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten
The matter of clean and unclean only occurred at the time of the exodus when there was a separation between the Jews and the Gentiles
From that time forward, there was a distinction between clean things which were edible and unclean things which were not edible
Edible things indicate things that are pleasing to God, while forbidden things indicate things that are not pleasing to God
Today the Israelites are not the only ones who are God's people; both the Gentiles and the Israelites are now God's people
We eat both the clean and the unclean to testify to the fact that both the Jews and the Gentiles are now God's people
To those who are advanced in knowledge, it is all right to eat things sacrificed to idols since idols are nothing
You eat because you realize that idols are vanity, but it is wrong for them to eat, because in their hearts the idols are something
As God's children, we must realize that food is for the nourishment of the body and for the preservation of our physical life
They think that if they can achieve such a state one day, they will be holy persons and will be beyond earthly contamination
Even with less educated and less sophisticated people, there is a concept that a person is good and noble if he achieves a certain standard
We have the concept that as Christians we should now achieve the ideal living which we failed to achieve before
He does not realize that this ideal life belongs altogether to the world; it has nothing to do with being a Christian
Please bear in mind that even though many people have become Christians, their standard is still a heathen standard
Almost all unbelievers yield to lust, but in their hearts they admire those who are freed from lust and from material bondage
Paul told us that if we died with Christ, we are freed from the philosophy of the world, and this problem does not even exist
He said, 'Why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances: Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch'?
The prevailing philosophy of the time was that lust would be held in check if it was separated from material things
Paul said, 'Why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances: Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch'?
If we have seen the light and touched the truth of crucifixion, we will praise God for it rather than pursue it
We can stand beside him and proclaim that he will no longer steal; he has been freed from stealing because he is dead
Men think that they cannot eat this, and that they must not touch that, but these are all teachings and commandments of men, not of God
They are merely human concepts, consisting of nothing but idealistic ordinances that have nothing to do with God
It is also like a dress which looks good in the show window but tears in different places as soon as a person puts it on
As long as they have not overcome the world within, they can never escape it by outwardly running away from it
They want to flee, to separate themselves, to leave the things of the world behind, and to break the chain of their own lusts
Their arguments appear logical and wise, and people may be misled to think that these men are indeed men of wisdom
What distinguishes us from others is not a strong will that suppresses the lusts, but a strong spirit that touches God's grace
While not all Greeks were extreme, one school of Greek ascetics spread their teachings to India and later to China
They taught that the body is the root of all evil, and that if a man is freed from his body, he can be freed from sin
Buddhism reckons the body to be the root of all sin and that one can be freed from sin as soon as he is freed from the body
Since the body produces so many sins, they believe that one should afflict the body in the hope that the sufferings will reduce the sins
We must see that after the shedding of blood by the Lord Jesus and the receiving of the cross, one must be baptized immediately
If we pay attention to what we should not touch, taste, or handle, we are setting our mind on the things of the earth
Christians should not pay attention to asceticism, because this is an error; it will introduce heathen doctrines into the Christian fold
Men of one age may be materialistically inclined, but the next age will react against materialism and extol asceticism
God has no intention that man take his food without the sense of taste; He likes man to have enjoyment while he eats
In the same way, God gave man the urge for sex for the purpose of reproduction and the continuation of human life
They constantly restrain themselves from seeing, handling, eating, touching, and listening to all kinds of things
If someone gives him more to eat, he should feel free to take the offer; there is nothing wrong with eating more
Some do not have as many riches of Christ, and you will be taking their world away from them if you take marriage away from them
If Christ's glory is not expressed, minor things will become major things, and we will apply asceticism to them
Those who do not know the Lord may cherish these things, but those who know the Lord will easily and effortlessly transcend them
There was nothing unchristian about John's not eating, and there was nothing unchristian about the Lord Jesus' eating
The outward living of a Christian is always governed by the discipline of the Holy Spirit, not by his own choice
Those who sleep on a mud floor are Christians, and those who sleep on nice spring mattresses are also Christians
Once we pay attention to these things, we will lower Christianity and degenerate its glorious spiritual life into ordinances
He told others that this person was wonderful because he left home to preach the gospel on the very day of his marriage
Some local ones criticized them, saying, 'We doubt whether a woman can still work for the Lord when she has such a nice overcoat on'
If this were suffering for the kingdom, every rickshaw driver would enter the kingdom because they suffer more than we
If the Christianity we preach consisted of nothing except eating dressing clothing and beds our preaching of Christianity would be tasteless
It is different from your kind of joy and weeping, from your teaching on using worldly things and not using worldly things
All things will pass away and vanish before our eyes when God magnifies the greatness of these positive things to us
May we all see that Christians are not ascetics; they live a flexible life, because He who is in us is so great and so glorious
One kind of illness comes from sin, while the other kind of illness does not come from sin; some sicknesses are not the result of sin
There are many individuals whose illness is caused by sin, but there are others whose illness is not caused by sin
We need to understand the relationship between illness and sin as it pertains to individuals and to mankind in general
In 1 Corinthians 5:4-5 Paul spoke of his judgment to deliver one who sinned 'to Satan for the destruction of his flesh'
Paul said that there were some in the church in Corinth who took the Lord's bread and drank His cup without discerning the Body
We can discover natural causes for many illnesses, but we cannot blame these natural causes for all of our sicknesses
Normally, those who have poor health are more easily infected, and those who have good health are not as easily infected
Those who do not meet the conditions for infection are infected, while those who do meet the conditions for infection are not infected
He went on to explain, 'Tuberculosis germs will incubate and develop into a case of tuberculosis of the lungs only under suitable conditions
There may be many natural causes for sickness, but God will allow a sickness to occur only when the right conditions are present
The Holy Spirit taught Matthew to describe the earthly Lord Jesus as One who took away our infirmities and bore our diseases
We need to note that He bore our sorrows and took away our infirmities before His death on the cross, while He was still on earth
We have to realize that the overthrowing of sickness that comes from sin is one of the Lord Jesus' commissions
Salvation and redemption have brought about a complete solution to sin, but sickness is not completely removed
Unless you are as confident as Paul, who after praying three times realized that his illness was for his perfection, you should seek healing
If a person is not clear that God wants his infirmity and illness to remain in him, he should by all means seek healing
If you deal with God in this way, He will intervene for you and will deliver you out of your woe in a short time
Sometimes God allows help to come from natural means or from medicine, but at other times, God may not want us to receive help from medicine
Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord
The prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him'
Sometimes a person has moved away from the protection and circulation of the Body through disobedience, sin, or other matters
As soon as a member does something wrong in his standing as a member, the life of the Body stops flowing into that part of the Body
If this is the reason for a person's illness, he needs to ask for the supply of the Body to flow through him once again
There are many people, especially those who know the church, who become ill as soon as they become individualistic
Although there are natural causes for sickness, you must know that spiritual reasons far outweigh natural reasons
You should remember that you must accept not only the illness but also the lesson that comes with this illness
Illness alone cannot sanctify a person; it is the acceptance of the lesson that comes with the illness that sanctifies a person
Many sick brothers and sisters who are so anxious about their health seem to believe that their sicknesses are in the enemy's hand
Their thoughts are occupied with nothing but themselves day and night; in their view everything revolves around them
As soon as he denied his self-love, rejected sympathy, and dropped his expectation for consolation, his illness went away
We should not wait until we have sinned and something is wrong with our bodies before we look to God for healing
The first is a matter of the Lord's power, the second is a matter of His will, and the third is a matter of His act
In effect, he is saying that the power of a little bacteria which can be seen only under a microscope is stronger than the power of God
He told the Pharisees, 'Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk'?
Saying such words is, of course, very easy, because they can be said, but no one will actually know whether the sins were forgiven
Consider whether this is better Which is harder to say to the paralytic Your sins are forgiven or to say Rise and take up your mat and walk
He said, 'Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk'?
From their point of view, forgiving sins and asking a paralytic to pick up the mat and walk were both difficult
Mark 1:41 says, 'Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, 'I will; be clean''
Hope involves the expectation that something will happen in the future, whereas faith knows that something has happened already
You know that something is still wrong with this, and you ask him again, 'Are you sure that you will be saved'?
He may say that he will be saved, definitely will be saved, or surely will be saved, but something does not sound right
If a believer desires to run a straight course in his spiritual pursuit, he must learn the meaning of God's governmental forgiveness
We will first distinguish the differences between these kinds of forgiveness, and then we will speak about governmental forgiveness
John 20:22-23 says, 'And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit
After this He said, 'Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained'
They pray for forgiveness with weeping and tears of repentance, and they receive the Lord Jesus with a sincere heart
At such times, it is good for a representative of the church to stand up and say to them, 'God has forgiven you of your sins'!
Verse 23 continues, 'Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained'
Only when the church has received the Holy Spirit and is under the authority of the Holy Spirit can it act as an instrument to God
Only after the Lord has made a man an instrument can he proclaim to a sinner, 'You are forgiven of your sins'!
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
After we believe in the Lord, confess our Christian faith, and receive eternal forgiveness, we may still sin at times
All biologists know that life has two basic characteristics: First, it strives to live, to preserve itself, to continue its existence
After we have believed in the Lord and are saved, our fellowship with God and with other children of God can be interrupted if we offend Him
She may close the door of the kitchen properly, clean her face, and wipe the table, but a transgression has been committed!
We call it forgiveness in fellowship because only when one turns back to God and confesses his sins can his fellowship with God be restored
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
We can understand this kind of forgiveness from the following verses: Matthew 6:14-15; 9:2, 5-6; 18:21-35; James 5:15
On that particular day, when she comes back to the house, she may discover that her daughter has stolen food from the cabinets
The father forgives them and lets them out again the next day, but they get into a fight with other children again
He may say, 'Starting from tomorrow, you will stay at home and not go out because you have been fighting outside'
God will remove His governmental hand only when He has full assurance that His children are doing the right things
When the father sees his children continuing to make trouble, he will tell them to stay at home and withhold their freedom
If the children do not engage in a fight, the father may allow them to go out again for half an hour the next day
Governmental forgiveness is absolutely different from eternal forgiveness, instrumental forgiveness, and forgiveness in fellowship
If we do not understand governmental forgiveness, it will be hard to understand what the Lord Jesus was saying
In order for the paralytic to be healed and to rise again, he first needed to receive governmental forgiveness
When others carried the paralytic to the Lord Jesus, His forgiveness clearly related to the sickness of paralysis
Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord
The prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him'
The elders of the church were invited to anoint him with oil and pray for him, and the prayer of faith would cause the sick to rise up
The sin here is not forgiven through the confession of the sick one; it is forgiven through the prayer of the elders of the church
Although he has confessed his sins and has been forgiven and restored to fellowship, God's disciplining hand has not been lifted
He has to wait for the elders of the church to come to him and make petition on his behalf, saying, 'The brothers have forgiven his sins
When God removes His governmental hand, we have the fulfillment of the word, 'If he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him'
To understand the significance of governmental forgiveness, we must consider the example of David in the Old Testament
No portion of the Bible speaks of God's governmental forgiveness as clearly as the story of David with Uriah's wife
God had already put away David's sins, but He would cause the son born to Uriah's wife to die and the sword not to depart from his house
As soon as He stretches forth His governmental hand, you can do nothing except humble yourself under His mighty hand
The more we humble ourselves under His mighty hand and give up all resistance, the easier it is for God to lift His governmental hand
Suppose a brother loved sugar too much as a youth, and his teeth have decayed from the overconsumption of sweets
If you confess your weakness, the fellowship will be restored, but it does not mean that good teeth will grow back after your confession
God wanted him to command water to flow out from the rock, but he smote the rock with his rod and lost his composure
When they saw that it would take two people to carry a cluster of grapes, they realized that the land was a land flowing with milk and honey
They became afraid and refused to enter into that land, because they saw that the people who dwelt in that land were of great stature
He wanted to be a good Christian, but he did not want to set aside his career or spend his life for the gospel
Please bear in mind that our greatest fear is God's disciplining hand; we do not know when His hand will come upon us!
The fact that a person can call God Father proves that the matter of eternal forgiveness with him has long been settled
When the slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, he seized him and took him by the throat
We should not only be generous in forgiving others but also avoid criticizing or speaking about others in a light way
Please bear in mind that our criticism and careless comments about others often becomes a judgment upon ourselves
Sometimes a person may make a remark about someone's troublesome children, saying, 'See how God's hand is always on this person'
We must not say that since God has ordained that they go through persecution and suffering, we will do our part by adding suffering to them
We cannot say that we will add more sufferings to them because God has ordained their persecution and affliction
There are many brothers who have fallen miserably today for one reason only-they have criticized others too severely in the past
We must always ask God for mercy in dealing with our foolishness and weakness, both in our walk and in everything we do
Should we fall into God's governmental hand, for any reason great or small, the last thing we should do is rebel
There is only one principle we can act upon when we fall into God's hand; that is, to humble ourselves under God's mighty hand
Although the Hebrew believers also suffered some shame and endured the cross, they had not yet resisted unto blood
We can expect many trials and tribulations, but what is the purpose and meaning behind all these trials and tribulations?
He said that if the Lord disciplines us, we must not regard it lightly; and if the Lord reproves us, we must not faint
As Christians they feel that they have suffered too much hardship in their environment and that it is too hard to live the Christian life
Their thought is on entering the pearly gates and walking on a golden street wearing fine, white linen garments
Many children of God have been Christians for eight or ten years, yet they have never given serious consideration to God's discipline
The first thing we should do when we experience something is to find the meaning of our experience: Why have things happened this way?
It is to say that God can do whatever He wants to do and that we must simply go through these experiences mindlessly and aimlessly
If the Christian life became nothing but a story of suffering and frustration, it would be too much of a discouragement to us
We must learn to accept the discipline of the Lord and to see that His discipline and reproach are always meaningful
God has no time to discipline everyone in the world, but He disciplines His own children because He loves them
He will train his son according to a few objectives, namely, honesty, diligence, long-suffering, and noble aspirations
At the very beginning of his Christian life, a child of God must realize that God has prepared many lessons for him
He wants to build up a certain kind of character in us, and He does it by ordering all kinds of circumstances to come our way
They walk according to their own will and wander in a wild, unrestrained, and aimless way through the wilderness
In verse 7 the apostle explains the quotation from Proverbs in verses 5 and 6, saying, 'It is for discipline that you endure'
What are the discipline and scourging in verses 5 and 6 and what are the shame affliction and resistance against sin in verses 2 through 4
Although our resistance against sin is not unto blood, the pain and tribulation are nevertheless part of God's discipline
We see a big contrast when a person understands that what is happening to him is of God; he will have a different view toward his experience
Verse 8 says, 'But if you are without discipline, of which all sons have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons'
Those who are without discipline are illegitimate; they belong to other families and are not members of the household of God
When the mother of three of the children came, she spanked her children on their hands and forbade them to dirty themselves again
Because we are sons, there is discipline; since there is discipline, there must also be submission on our part
We may think that we have nothing to obey, but when God disciplines us a little, we immediately think of ways of escape
Often parents discipline their children in a poor way, because they act and discipline according to their own whims
No discipline or reproach of God is merely a punishment; it is educational in nature, and it is there for our profit
May the Lord be merciful to us so that His discipline, whenever it is upon us, may produce a little more holiness
After we accept the Lord and become God's children, He daily arranges many things in our environment to discipline and chastise us
If we neglect God's discipline, and if it does not produce the needed effect in us, our loss will be an eternal loss indeed!
God not only gives us His holiness as a gift, but He also wants us to partake of His holiness through His discipline
Carnal persons like us require years of discipline from God before His holy character and nature can become ours
We need all kinds of blows, situations, guidance, frustrations, urgings, and chastisement before we can partake of God's holy character
If a person brews liquor from grapes or other kinds of fruit, the wine surfaces to the top, while the lees settle to the bottom
A brother may experience God's uprooting through his consecration; everything that he owns may be completely uprooted
A brother may experience God's uprooting through his sufferings and trials; he may be stripped of everything he has
God disciplines us and deals with us in many ways so that we may lose our original smell and yield the peaceable fruit
The peaceable fruit of righteousness can be translated as 'the peaceable fruit, which is the fruit of righteousness'
The hands may hang down and the knees may be paralyzed, but there is the fruit of peace and the fruit of righteousness
After we are disciplined and scourged, we need to set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees
If a person goes through trials and humbles himself under God's mighty hand, he will find his character constituted with holiness
Those habits, character traits, and disposition have now become a frustration to the expression of the new life
We may meet someone who is very gentle or very quick, but their gentleness and quickness are unregenerated gentleness and quickness
On the other hand, the Holy Spirit is creating a new nature and a new character in us little by little, with its new living and new habits
Man's own effort to tear himself down will only result in outward adornment; it will only hinder the growth of the spiritual life
In order to clarify the breaking and constituting work in us, we will use the phrase the discipline of the Holy Spirit for now
God arranges the outward environment, but the Holy Spirit translates this arrangement into something inward and applies it to us
Indeed, God orders the environment through the Holy Spirit; He does not order our lives directly but rather does so through the Holy Spirit
We call the environmental arrangements of the Holy Spirit and the inner prompting stopping and forbidding the discipline of the Holy Spirit
If no sparrow falls on the ground without our Father's permission, how much more is our environment under His caring hand?
Whether it be happiness, affliction, health, sickness, joy, or pain, everything that comes our way is approved by the Father
As soon as we believe in the Lord we should be clear about a few things First we need to be torn down and then we need to be built up again
We do not do the tearing-down and building-up work ourselves; God arranges the environment to tear us down and build us up
A husband and a wife may be very close to each other, yet God will arrange a different environment for each of them
In operating through our environment, God measures discipline to each one of us according to our individual needs
Romans 828 says And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God to those who are called according to His purpose
We do not work out this holiness in ourselves; God is the One who creates this holy character in us through our environment
When we look back after some time, we will surely know why the Lord has done what He has done and what His purpose was for doing it
In other words, when God works, it is possible for us to receive the good, and it is also possible for us not to receive the good
They experience much discipline, and God has arranged many things around them, but these things do not result in any riches on their part
Because God has done it and because God has allowed it to come upon us for our good, we humble ourselves and say nothing
In the old days there was no filter, and the only way to remove the lees was to pour the liquid from one vessel to another
Sometimes some lees would escape with the liquid to the other vessel, and there would be the need to pour the liquid to yet another vessel
Every day we will be a little different than the day before, and the next day we will be different still further
He struggled with his older brother in his mother's womb and strove to be the firstborn by holding on to his brother's heel
In other words, when trials arise, it may appear that we are failing, but His grace will always carry us through
Many of the so-called problems among the brothers and sisters come from our imagination; they have no factual basis
Sometimes when you see a brother or a sister, you may feel that he or she has a problem with you or that there is a distance between you
If a person pays too much attention to Satans temptations his mind will become confused and he will easily become a prey to Satans snares
If a person has to reject Satan day and night, something is wrong with his mind; he is heading down the wrong road
If a person's mind is constantly worried about thoughts from Satan, he is in reality giving ground to Satan to enter into him
Once there is a second withstanding, be sure there will be a third, a fourth, even a hundredth, and a thousandth
Once we have withstood him once, there is no need to withstand him a second time because the matter has been settled already
The dumbness and deafness of the child were outward symptoms of his demon possession; they were not ordinary illnesses
The boils on Job's body could not be healed by medicine; they were not medical illnesses; they were attacks from the devil
The complication lies in the fact that Satan does not want us to uncover and expose the illnesses he has inflicted
He always hides behind natural symptoms and makes us think that every sickness is the result of natural causes
The reproach of the Holy Spirit grows stronger and stronger as time goes on; the accusation of Satan is the same from beginning to end
The more we are reproved by the Holy Spirit, the more we are strengthened within to deal with our problem before the Lord
We must realize that the blood of the Lamb is the basis of our forgiveness before God as well as the basis of our acceptance in Him
Those who consider themselves to be good are foolish, and those who are blind to the saving power of the Lord are foolish as well
Those who believe in their own power are foolish, and those who do not believe in the Lord's power are foolish as well
The blood of the Lamb' and 'the word of their testimony' spoken of previously are two conditions for victory over Satan
We must be sure that they have enough strength before the Lord to go on before we give them stronger advice or urge them to move ahead
As long as you have the assurance within that you can help him, a little push may be all that is necessary to bring him through his trouble
We must point out Hebrews 10:22 to those who are under Satan's accusation: 'Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience'
When a Christian is condemned in his conscience, he will be weak before God and will be debilitated in all spiritual matters
There are many things in our environment which, though permitted by God, are the result of Satan's direct and active work
An even clearer example can be seen in Matthew 8, when the Lord Jesus ordered the disciples to depart to the other side of the sea
After He and the disciples stepped into the boat, suddenly a great tempest arose in the sea so that the boat was covered by the waves
The winds and the sea have no personality of their own, yet the Lord rebuked them because the devil was behind them
In conclusion, Satan not only attacks our body, our conscience, and our mind, but also attacks us through our environment
When they humble themselves, and their attitude before God is firm, God will show them that it is not Him but Satan who is doing the work
Whoever desires to withstand Satan must learn to know the difference between the Lord's authority and Satan's power
The manifestation of the Lord Jesus destroyed the works of the devil, and the death of the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil himself
The Lord's death pronounces the greatest defeat for the devil because the Lord's death is not only a punishment but also a way of salvation
Although Satan reigns through death, the more he reigns through death, the worse his lot becomes, because his reign stops at death
When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross for us, the old creation and the old man were both crucified with Him
If a man is still pursuing crucifixion, he is standing on fleshly ground, and Satan has full control over those who stand on fleshly ground
These verses begin with resurrection and end with resurrection, and the verses in between speak of triumphing in the cross
Just as Satan had nothing in the Lord Jesus while He was on earth , so also he has nothing in Him in resurrection
Little did they realize that the Lord Jesus would go into death, come out of death, and overcome the authority of death!
It is a life that transcends death, that is beyond the boundary of death, that comes out of death, and that death cannot hold
Ephesians 1:20-22 says, 'Raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all
Ephesians 2:6 says, 'And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus'
We are raised up together with Christ and are seated together with Him in the heavenlies, far above all the power of Satan
Ephesians 6:11 and 13 say, 'Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil
To sit is to rest in the Lord's victory, while to stand is to withstand Satan and to stop him from taking away our victory
How great is the difference between a person who tries to overcome and one who withstands by knowing that he has already overcome
Corinthians 11:2-16 does not speak of believers as brothers and sisters; rather, it speaks of them as men and women
Neither does the matter of head covering have anything to do with the relationship between Christ and His church
Later, when God poured out His Spirit at the time of Pentecost, the believers who were present began to speak in tongues
We must identify the two different systems here before we can understand the two different situations Saul was under
The kings and the leaders of the Israelites belonged to the side of God's government; they maintained the system of God's government
In the new heaven and the new earth, the system of grace and the system of government will join together and become one system
Those who are saved in this age must learn the fundamental lesson of not frustrating God's government with His grace
The system of government is not for the system of grace; rather, the system of grace is here to perfect the system of government
God not only cast them out of the garden of Eden; He also guarded the garden with cherubim so that Adam and Eve could not go back
Although God was merciful to him and brought him to the mount of Pisgah, he could not join the people of God in entering Canaan
God's grace allowed him to see the boundary of the land, but God's government forbade him from entering the land
These verses do not say anything about the relationship between the Father and the Son; that is a relationship in the Godhead
In His government God appoints man to be the head, just as He appoints Christ to be the Head and He appoints Himself to be the Head
Similarly, Christ is the Head of every man in God's government, and man is the head of the woman in God's government
In terms of God's government, Christ did not stand in the position of God the Son, but in the position of the Christ, the One sent by God
He cannot overturn his master's authority or the government's authority just because he has believed in the Lord
Every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved'
The significance of head covering is that one puts himself under God's government; he acknowledges this position
There are many things which one does for himself, but there are also many things which one does as a representative of the whole group
She also covers her head as a representative, because she represents every man, and she also represents Christ
Verse 10 says, 'Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels'
We are doing this to testify to the angels that have rebelled that we accept Christ as our Head and we accept God as the Head'
When we have the sign of submission on our head, that is, when we cover our head, we are rendering the best testimony to the fallen angels
The problem with some is that either they do not do anything at all or they go to an extreme when they do something
Verse 15 says, 'But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering'
Verse 15 says, 'But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering'
If a sister does not cover her head but instead shaves off her hair, we can say that she is still obeying the Scripture
Verse 6 says that if a woman does not have her hair covered she must be shaved, and that if she is not shaved she must cover her head
Verse 16 says, 'But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God'
In the same way, God being the Head of Christ and Christ being the Head of every man are universal matters, not Corinthian matters
Jewish men and women covered their heads with a head covering called a 'tallith' before entering the synagogue
The custom of the Greeks was that when men and women entered their temple, both uncovered and exposed their heads
No race or country during Paul's time had the custom of men uncovering their heads and women covering their heads
One is that we walk as individuals before God, and the other is that we walk in the capacity of a representative before God
If we treat our servants poorly, we sin as individuals and also as representatives; we have misrepresented the Lord
When Moses was at Meribah in Kadesh, he was angry at the Israelites because they tempted God, and he struck the rock twice
If this had only been a personal matter or an independent act as a leader of Israel, Moses could have been forgiven
A sister has to cover her head as an individual, and she has to cover her head in the position of a representative
The church in Ephesus refers to the period of church history during the end of the first century, when the book of Revelation was written
It began with Constantine's acceptance of Christianity as the state religion at the beginning of the fourth century in A
The second church appears after the first one has disappeared, and the third church appears after the second one has disappeared
In the same way the sixth church comes out of the fifth, yet both the fourth, fifth, and sixth exist simultaneously
By the time the sixth produces the seventh, all four churches-the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh-exist simultaneously
The first three churches did not receive any promise of the Lord's coming, but the last four all received a promise of the Lord's coming
If we choose a church which is not well pleasing to the Lord and which the Lord condemns, we will suffer a great loss before the Lord
After the Caesar of Rome accepted Christianity as the state religion, he promoted Christianity and propped it up with his political power
The church in Thyatira and the teachings of Jezebel have two characteristics: One is fornication, and the other is idol worship
Everything that the Bible describes about the priesthood was applied by the Roman Catholic Church to their priests
They have not only borrowed from Judaism but also have brought many things from the Greek religion and Roman temples into Christianity
Roman Catholicism claims that it has found the actual cross, and many small crosses have been made from the wood of this cross
Those in advanced civilizations create beautiful images, while those in more backward civilizations have only crude objects
If anyone dug out a leg or a bone of a martyr, the Roman Catholic Church would gather around it and worship it
Panton once said, 'The errors in their books are so numerous that one hardly realizes that they are errors at all'
The condition of Sardis can be seen from the words, 'I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead
Though Sardis includes the Reformation, she is not a picture of the Reformation but a picture of the whole of Protestantism
The Reformation took place during a time in which the nations in Europe could no longer tolerate Catholicism's suppression
Although they were persecuted by the Catholic Church, they continued in their faith in the Lord's recovery work
The Bible was opened up and men began to see light; men and women everywhere were enlightened about their salvation
Part of the reason was that Roman Catholicism was armed with not only religious power but also political power
The believers in Germany formed the German state church, and all German citizens became members of this church
Not only are believers included in the church, but all the citizens of the land are qualified to be baptized in the church as well
They began to realize that many joined the state churches through their so-called 'baptism,' not through faith
At the beginning, when these dissenting ones separated themselves from the state churches, they were branded as divisive
In order for God's children to follow Him, they had no choice but to separate themselves from these state churches
The history of Protestantism shows that God is continually raising up men here and there to seek His heart and to exercise judgment on sin
If every child of God judged sin today and dealt with everything that is not of God they would be one with one another and one with the Lord
They begin to say, 'We have received so much grace from the Lord; we should think of some means to preserve this grace
As a result, human creeds, regulations, and ways and means are introduced in an effort to maintain the blessing
God has to go to another person or to a few persons who will seek new vision, new blessing, new separation, and new grace
Not all are dead, for there are always a few who have not defiled themselves, who are the prominent ones chosen and used by God
In church history there was never a time when the ministry of the Word was as rich as that which we find in Philadelphia
In the long history of the church throughout the ages, the name of the Lord Jesus has always been last in importance
Since Sardis came out of Thyatira and Philadelphia came out of Sardis, Laodicea naturally has to come out of Philadelphia
As soon as Philadelphia becomes degraded the brothers become the many people and its brotherly love becomes the opinions of the many
The opinion of the Lord is lost, and the only things left are the vote of the majority, ballots, and the show of hands
There is only one group of proud people-those who were Philadelphia and who had once kept God's word and not denied His name
There is only one group of people who can boast of their riches-fallen Philadelphia, the Philadelphia which has lost its power and life
Brothers and sisters, if you want to continue in the way of Philadelphia, remember to humble yourselves before God
As soon as we are not careful, we have the flavor of Laodicea: 'We are wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing'
Or were you once Philadelphia but are now living in the shadow of history and boasting of your former glory, thus becoming Laodicean?
Similarly, once the overall issue of Roman Catholicism is settled, we do not have to be so concerned about its minor issues
Once the overall issue of Roman Catholicism is settled, these twenty-one organizations are no longer a problem
Once the general issue of Protestantism is settled, we do not need to deal with all of its fifteen hundred denominations one by one
Once we take the way of Philadelphia, the greatest temptation is to become proud and say, 'We are better than you are
Every reader of prophesy knows that Roman Catholicism will become more and more powerful, while Protestantism will become weaker and weaker
Revelation 17 says that the great harlot, which typifies Roman Catholicism, will ride on the beast and then be killed by it
We who are the watchmen of the church must pay attention to this matter and deal with it before it becomes a problem
When God sowed His word into the world, His intention was for such a mustard seed to remain an herb when it grew up
God's ordained law from the beginning of His creation is for the mustard seed to grow according to its kind-into an herb
The church can be food to men, and it can feed men, but it must be reaped bundle by bundle, again and again, like crops of herbs
The Godordained way for the church is one that is according to the footsteps of Jesus of Nazareth the One who was hidden lonely and humble
The Roman Caesars who ruled over the world, who controlled the destiny of the nations, suddenly became the church's partners and brothers
Still later, the bishops began to oversee not only the church in their own locality but churches in several localities
The bishop was considered to be an elder of the elders; he presided over the other elders and ruled over the church in that locality
When Constantine accepted Christianity, he saw a church which by then had already become the Roman Catholic Church, a church welcomed by men
Matthew 13:33 says, 'The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal'
The Roman Catholic Church tells men that the Bible is God's Word, yet it also says that the church can speak for God
It would have been better for the church if it had received its teaching from the Head instead of assuming the role of teacher for itself
Many people feel that it is too hard to accept the Lord Jesus and His teachings; they find it hard to digest these things
Those who study the types of the Old Testament know clearly that fine flour refers to the life of the Lord Jesus
If he sins, he can buy an indulgence, which will deliver him from the sins of this life as well as the future purgatory
Roman Catholicism does not ask men to take the leaven; it only asks men to take the fine flour which contains the leaven
She has not only established a large church on earth, but has even extended her dominion over the nations of the earth
Transubstantiation, the doctrine of turning the bread into the actual flesh of Christ as soon as one touches it, has prevailed
There are all kinds of organizations within it, and one could not understand all of them even if he spent several years to study them
Originally, an overseer was an elder of a local church, and the elders of the local churches were called overseers
Does this declaration sound like something that should come out of the mouth of one who follows the lowly Jesus of Nazareth?
In the Vatican Conference in 1870, a decree read, 'The Pope of Rome cannot change or improve on his own words'
To commit a moral sin after one is married is adultery, but to commit a moral sin without a marriage at all is harlotry
Revelation 17:18 says, 'The woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth'
If the beast is the imperial Rome, which includes seven kings and ten kings, the woman has to be the religious Rome
The cathedrals in Rome the idols in the cathedrals and all the adornments and crowns of the pope are made of gold precious stone and pearls
Revelation 17:6 says, 'I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus'
Since the time of Martin Luther, all bishops of the Roman Catholic Church had to make a solemn vow to persecute the heretics
The Catholic Church would not execute the judgment itself, but it would hand the case over to local officials for execution
The Roman Catholic Church openly professes that the words of Thomas Aquinas are direct inspirations of the Holy Spirit
As late as 1809 there were still witnesses who saw Protestants, the so-called heretics, killed in Madrid, the capital of Spain
There were some who were half-alive, while others, both men and women, young and old, even men in their seventies, were among the victims
The instruments of torture that were employed could only have been conceived of by Satan in collaboration with men
One way of dealing with the Protestants was this: 'Hang a person by the legs with a pulley and tie him with a rope
In 1540 the Jesuit Society was formed by the Roman Catholic Church to counteract the Protestants, and from that time more than 1
The Scripture is indeed fulfilled: 'I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus'
Verse 15 says, 'He said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues'
The Bible shows us that this harlot sits upon many waters, which means that Roman Catholicism will expand tremendously
By 1922 there were twenty-five countries with ambassadors in the Vatican, and Rome had twenty-five emissaries overseas
At the time Paul saw the light on his way to Damascus, the Lord said to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
It says, 'Whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it'
If the Body were in heaven, it would be reasonable to say that it rejoices, but it would be unreasonable to say that it suffers
We must be clear that Christian oneness is something which is manifested on earth and which is in the world today
Some may tell others, 'Do not worry whether or not the church is one today, and do not be concerned whether Christians are one
Oneness does not mean that we have to be one with whoever bears the resemblance of Christianity or the name of a Christian
The slaves of the master of the house then came and said to the master, 'Do you want us then to go and collect them'?
The Roman Catholic Church has done just that; they are ready to uproot all tares, that is, all those whom they consider to be heretics
When the Word speaks of letting both grow together until the harvest, it does not mean to let both grow together in the church
In the state churches, as long as one is a citizen of that country or born of that country, he can be baptized and be a member of the church
If you also decide that a Japanese person should be counted as being Chinese, you are broadening the principle
Brothers, any group which openly practices the principle of receiving both the saved and the unsaved is not the church; it is the world
If there is a group which receives and mixes both believers and unbelievers, both saved and unsaved, God commands us to come out of it!
In so-called Christianity today, as long as a person bears the name of a Christian, he can walk in openly at high noon
We must be very careful before God not to make any mistakes, but being wrong intentionally or being wrong in principle is another matter
If a group knows that a certain person is an unbeliever yet capriciously admits him, this group surely is not the church
We are required only to keep the oneness of the wheat; we do not have to keep the oneness between wheat and tares
Today there are many groups on earth which call themselves the church but include both believers and unbelievers
Christian fellowship is as broad as the Body of Christ, and the church of Christ is as large as the Body of Christ
As pointed out in the previous section, there is a danger of enlarging the Body of Christ to include false ones
If we maintain any oneness that has a boundary smaller than that of the Body of Christ, we are involved in what the Bible calls a division
Suppose these believers establish a principle of excluding anyone who is not immersed in water, even if such a one is a child of God
Suppose after a while, another brother comes and pleads with him, saying, 'We are all Christians, and we are all children of God
The division in 1 Corinthians 12 refers to a division from the Body , not a separation from a group which is not according to the Body
Suppose one day one of these brothers whether Stephen or Philemon stood up and said We have been meeting together and having good fellowship
We feel that God's servant Paul is particularly used by God and that we should pay more attention to his teachings
They do not see their own divisiveness, but if someone goes out from among them, they say that he is being divisive
Many so-called people of God, many so-called Christian groups, have already separated themselves from the Body
They do not realize that all those who are in the divisive groups and who refuse to depart from them are being divisive themselves
It is used six times in Acts and it is translated sect such as the sect of the Sadducees the sect of the Pharisees and the Nazarene sect
Whenever they met, those who said that they were of Paul met in one place and those who said that they were of Apollos met in another place
A man can revolt only against a legitimate government; he cannot revolt against a government which is itself not legitimate
It is strange for some who consider themselves servants of God to write books encouraging others to remain in the sects
Sectarianism, like idolatry, fornication, anger, and sorcery, is a work of the flesh; these are all on the same condemned list
The translators of the Bible probably chose not to translate the meaning of the word but instead used the word heresy
They invented a new English word, baptism, which does not mean anything in itself; it keeps a person in the dark as to its true meaning
Translating it as 'sect' or 'division' and calling sectarianism or division a work of the flesh would have aroused controversy
Because of reservations, the word heresy was used instead, and everyone has been kept in the dark as to the true meaning of the word
The Greek word hairesis was anglicized to become heresy in 1611, and the word heresy has been with us for the last three hundred years
Today many leaders in Christianity feel that they should pay attention to Christian oneness rather than oneness of the sects
Still another type has a boundary that is as large as the Body of Christ, but within this boundary there are segregated squares
Although the boundary of this kind of fellowship is as large as the Body, there are still many sects within this fellowship
Today ecumenical workers see the Body of Christ, but they are not willing to pay the price to take the fellowship of the Body
They emphasize the Body of Christ, yet the Body which they speak of does not have the members as its unit but organizations as its unit
In other words, if there are five thousand denominations throughout the world, they say that there are five thousand basic units in the Body
They are, in reality, first dividing to go along with man's will and then uniting to go along with God's intention
Brothers and sisters, you do not have to go to the denominations to find out that sectarianism is a work of the flesh
Today many people like to keep denominations on the one hand and try to arrive at some form of unity on the other
You should not think that you will have the same person after cutting him into pieces and then putting the pieces together again
There is no such thing as grouping members into many organizations and then uniting all these organizations into a Body
They must not willfully allow any unbelievers in their midst, and they must not replace the Body with ecumenical organizations
We admit that there are brothers and sisters in the sects, the state churches, and the ecumenical organizations
If they are faithful, they should come home; they should take the same stand as we have taken-a stand for the Body
As long as a brother or a sister is still wandering in the denominations, our heart should ache and we should be sad
Many of God's children have a basic misunderstanding; they think that patience and forbearance are the basis of oneness
We may say that fellowship is the basis of our oneness, but the basis of fellowship is our dealing with sin and our removal of sin
If a man is a vessel unto honor, he can pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
Only those who draw their swords and take a stand on God's side to kill their own brothers are qualified to be Levites
If you cannot go on, you can only blame your eyes for the lack of light and your heart for not being single enough
If you want to maintain any other type of oneness, you must be prepared to be defiled with sins and unrighteousnesses
If you want to be one with all the children of God, you must take a stand together with all the children of God in judging sin
We ask God to show them that oneness and light are possible only outside of organizations, methods, associations, and sects
Before the Gospel of John there are three Gospels the Gospels of Matthew Mark and Luke which cover many acts and teachings of the Lord Jesus
The Gospel of John shows us the highest and most spiritual things concerning the coming of the Son of God to earth
When we come to the final Epistles, the Epistles written by John, we find the emphasis shifting to other things
While the other Epistles pay much attention to a man's faith in God, John emphasizes one aspect of practical conduct before God
Suppose you have many friends and you like them very much, or you admire many people and respect them very much
There is still a difference between your feelings toward them and your feelings toward the brothers and sisters in your own family
If a person is born of your mother, if he is your brother, there is spontaneously a special and inexplicable feeling toward him
Suppose there is a person whose appearance, family background, education, disposition, and interest are totally different from yours
Through faith we pass out of death into life, and through faith we are made members of the household of God and are regenerated
Once we have this life, we will have a feeling for the many people throughout the world who also have this life
In the absence of this discernment, the more perfectly the gospel is preached, the greater will be the danger of counterfeits
The Epistles of John show us clearly that the way to differentiate true faith from false faith is not through faith itself but through love
Whether or not a person is a genuine Christian depends on whether he has a special taste for and attraction toward other children of God
John 4:7-8 says, 'Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God
Everyone who is begotten of God has love in him, and everyone who has love in him spontaneously loves the brothers
If a person knows that you are a brother and yet he hates you in his heart, it proves that he is not a Christian
If a person knows that you are a brother and are of the Lord yet still hates you, it proves that he has no life in him
In other words, the Bible denies the possibility that anyone can hate his brothers; it does not accept this as a possibility at all
Verse 15 says, 'Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him'
If there is a brother who has committed a sin worthy of excommunication, we may deal with the matter with indignation
If there is a brother who has done something extremely evil, we may ask him to come to us and rebuke him severely before the Lord
Under normal circumstances, if a brother has done things which irritate you, you can exhort him and rebuke him, but you cannot hate him
Even if you 'tell it to the church,' according to Matthew 18, your intention should still be to gain him and restore him
The purpose of telling it 'to the church' in Matthew 18 is for restoration; the removing in 1 Corinthians 5 is also for restoration
If a person can only judge and condemn but has no tears or sadness it proves that he does not know anything about brotherly love
If anyone rebukes a brother only for the purpose of tearing him down, such a one has no love in him, only hatred
Darby's first words were, 'I think it is the most dreadful thing for a sinner whose sins have been forgiven to excommunicate another sinner'
It is a willingness to deny oneself for the perfection of others, and a heart that will even lay down one's very own life for his brothers
John 4:10-12 says, 'Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins
God commands us to leave the denominations and not remain in any sects; however, many of God's children promote the denominations
We must leave the denominations if we want to love God, and we should stay in the denominations if we want to love our brothers
It is right for us to obey and follow God's commandments, but we must not offend our parents in our attitude and our words
We must show our brother that we are not doing something for ourselves; we are doing it because God has said so
Verses 17 and 18 say, 'In this has love been perfected with us, that we have boldness in the day of the judgment
At the time the Lord Jesus was on earth and even after His departure from the earth, the priesthood did not cease
According to the revelation of the Scripture, God's purpose is not to have only one or two persons as His priests
The people then worshipped the golden calf and said, 'These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt'
God had appointed them to be priests, but even before they were able to be His priests, they became priests to the golden calf
As he drew near to the camp and saw the condition of the people, his wrath waxed hot and he cast down the two tablets
Although nothing was said explicitly to that effect, God had reassigned the priesthood to the tribe of Levi alone
God's people and God's priests were one and the same in the tribe of Levi; that is, His people were His priests
In regards to the other eleven tribes, God's people were only God's people; they could no longer be God's priests
From Exodus until the time of the Lord Jesus on earth, no other tribe could function as priests except the tribe of Levi
For about fifteen hundred years, from the time of Moses to the time of Christ, God's people were unable to come directly to God
In the New Testament age, it is as if a voice from heaven bursts forth with the promise that the universal priesthood is with us once more
The same word can be found in Revelation 1:6, which says, 'And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father'
What the Israelites lost in the presence of the golden calf, the church has fully regained through the Lord Jesus
Craftsmen, businessmen, farmers, and all the other professionals are no longer living for their own professions
It is not only a gospel about Jesus' salvation; it is a gospel that even persons such as ourselves can serve God
In the church today the priesthood is no longer restricted to only a few people; it has become a universal priesthood
During the past two thousand years, the scope of the priesthood has never been recovered to include all the people of God
The two thousand years of church history show us a frequent separation between the people and the ministry of the priests
We can no longer allow priests to stand between God and His children; we can no longer accept an intermediary class
They cannot be the only ones through whom God speaks or the only ones through whom we approach God to settle spiritual matters
Today there is a hierarchy in the denominations-one group of people is serving God, while the rest are merely pew members
If all the brothers deny the world and reject idolatry from the beginning, they will all offer themselves up to God
Those who do not serve the Lord attend to their own affairs, while those who serve the Lord take care of spiritual affairs
They may be businessmen, teachers, or doctors, but they all attend to their own affairs and walk their own way
Today we should realize that either we are not Christians at all or we have to be those who consecrate everything to the Lord
The danger that haunted the nation of Israel is the same problem that has confronted the church over the past two thousand years
There were material benefits in believing in the Lord; one became a fellow believer of the emperor and a brother of Caesar
Originally, the Lord's charge was, 'Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God'
During the ten periods of persecution under the reign of Rome, tens of thousands of Christians suffered martyrdom
It became fashionable to be a believer and to share the same faith as the emperor and to call him one's brother
Some state churches follow the example of the Roman Catholic Church and give their pastors the title of priests
Those who tend to earthly affairs are called God's people, while those who manage spiritual things are called priests
Is one segment of the pathway of the church that is waiting for a fundamental recovery-the universal priesthood of God's children
If God is merciful to us, all the brothers and sisters will spontaneously be working, preaching the gospel, and serving the Lord together
To be a priest is to have no distance between us and God; it is to be able to enter in directly and to wait for no one
If one day all the brothers and sisters in all the churches rise up to serve, the kingdom of God will come among us
In order to fully understand the priesthood, we need to understand the way God dealt with the priests in the Old Testament
In principle, today's Christianity has fallen and has taken the way of the Israelites-the people and the priests have become two
When Saul was persecuting the church, on his way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus asked him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
He did not say, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting My disciples,' but 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
He did not say, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting My church,' but 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
Because the Body of Christ is the church on earth, Paul's persecuting of the church was his persecuting of the Lord Himself
If this were the case, Paul's persecution of the church could not have been considered as his persecution of the Lord
If we stand in the position of the Body of Christ, our number may be small, but we will still have a proper basis for forming the church
If we do not stand on the position of the Body of Christ, we will have no basis to form any church, even though our number may be very great
If the basis of the first 'church' is not the Body of Christ, one can, of course, set up a church that is based on the Body of Christ
In other words, whoever is of Christ should be in the church; whoever is in the Body of Christ may not be rejected
To accept anyone who is not in the Body of Christ or to embrace unbelievers is to go beyond the Body of Christ
There is only one basis for our fellowship in the church-our being fellow members with one another in the Body
Any fellowship that is not as large as the Body, that is in fact smaller than the Body, is not the fellowship of the Body
We are here to maintain the fellowship of Christians, the fellowship of the Body, not any fellowship that is smaller than the Body
The Lord grants the members different kinds of gifts and ministries for the purpose of supplying the need of the whole Body
As the human body needs all the members, so the church needs the different kinds of gifts and ministries for its spiritual service
As long as you are a Christian you are a member of the Body of Christ and as a member in the Body you must have your own service before God
Another matter which requires special attention in the Body is that both the grace and the gift that everyone receives are different
The passage in Romans 12, in addition to speaking of the ministry of the word, includes ministries of other services in the church as well
Whether ones gift is big or small whether it is five talents two talents or one talent he should exercise what he has and serve accordingly
If all the one-talented ones will rise up to serve, they will be more effective than the few who have five talents
If all the brothers and sisters are working and laboring, it will be the church serving and the Body functioning
Everyone who has the 'mina' should realize that the handkerchief is for wiping sweat, not for wrapping up his mina
The kinds of people spoken of here are slightly different from those spoken of in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12
Corinthians 10:16-17 says, 'The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ?
Whenever we come on the Lord's Day to break bread and remember the Lord, we acknowledge that the Lord has broken His body for us
The breaking of bread signifies the Lords giving of Himself in love on the cross for us the oneness speaks of the union among Gods children
Every Lord's Day we come to the Lord to acknowledge that His body was broken for us and that all of God's children are one
The more one understands the Body of Christ, the more he will testify of the oneness of the Body through the breaking of bread
The breaking of bread is a remembrance of the Lord's death, and it is an expression of the oneness of the Body
May the Lord be gracious to us, and may He show us clearly that the basis for forming the church is the Body of Christ
God established natural laws through His word of authority over every living creature and every natural element
If any object or creature acts contrary to God's ordained laws, the whole universe will be thrown into confusion
We know that the previous world became fallen when Satan, the archangel appointed by God, tried to exalt himself
Please bear in mind that in God's eyes, what happened in the garden of Eden was not only an offense but an act of disobedience
After the emergence of government, we find authority resting not only with the family but also with government
God told Abraham that his descendants would become slaves in Egypt, but that He would bring them out by the fourth generation
God would not tolerate men's sinning against Himself, and He would not tolerate men's sinning against His servants
Not only did God forbid men to sin against Himself, but He also forbade men to sin against His priests and prophets
God appointed authority among the children of Israel, and when they offended His authority, judgments and punishments would come upon them
He said that He spoke only what He heard and that He could do nothing from Himself except what He saw the Father doing
He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself fully under God's authority
Please bear in mind that the receiving of the Lord Jesus and our faith and salvation in Him are related to obedience
The underlying principle of the world is an overthrow of either God's direct authority or His appointed authority
If you ask a woman in the world today whether she is willing to submit to man, she will feel that such a demand makes no sense
They tell us that wives should be subject to their husbands, children to their parents, and slaves to their masters
Today God has given us a commandment: Wives should be subject to their husbands, children to their parents, and slaves to their masters
Today the church should be strong enough to declare that it can offer to God what He failed to gain at the time of Adam
The church should lift up her eyes and say, 'Lord, what You could not gain from Satan, You are gaining from us
Today the church says, 'We gladly put ourselves under the bondage and chains of the Son of God to learn the lesson of submission'
The church on earth maintains not only God's direct authority but also His indirect authority, that is, His deputy authority
Today we must realize that the Body is the authority, and the Body is the representative of the authority of Christ
We know only that it is right for cells to grow when there is a wound, and it is right for them to stop growing when the wound is healed
With cancer, however, cells do not want to be told when to grow and when to stop growing; they just grow on their own
All the nutrients passing through him will be eaten up by him for his own growth, not for the growth of the Body
It is difficult for a doctor to treat cancer because another principle is operating in the body, a principle that operates on its own
After we believe in the Lord, the first spiritual principle we should bear in mind is that the Body is God's ordained authority on earth
We must learn to accept the judgment and restriction of the Body and submit to the operation of the life of the whole Body
The longer we go on in our Christian life before the Lord, the more we will realize the reality of the oneness of the Body
The more we comprehend the things of the Body, the more we will realize how appropriate it is to compare the church to our body
If two or three can be fully in one accord, the Lord said that He would be in their midst and would answer their prayer
You should touch and see something of the reality of the spiritual world as soon as one person says something to you
That brother may invite one or two other brothers to come along, brothers who are clear before the Lord and who love the Lord wholeheartedly
If they tell you in one accord that you are wrong, even if you do not feel that you are wrong, you have to yield to their judgment
Often you may not feel that you are wrong, but if two or three godly men see things the same way, you should humble yourself before the Lord
Everywhere God's children are on earth, they should seek commandments to obey; they should seek the opportunity to submit
We must learn to submit to God, and not to Him only, but also to the authority God has appointed on earth-the church
If we consider this matter carefully before the Lord, we will realize that this kind of submission is mandatory in the church
These are brothers more mature than we; they are firstfruits in Christ and were begotten before we were begotten
Peter said that the younger men should be subject to the elderly ones, who are patterns to others before the Lord
If a young person finds someone taking care of him according to God's will, he should learn to subject himself to such a one before God
We should pay particular attention to our submission to the elderly brothers; they are clearly qualified to represent the Lord in the church
Timothy 517 says Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in word and teaching
You must render double honor toward those elders who take the lead well in the church and should never despise or criticize them
If it were up to us to choose a person to submit to, we would never find such a person on earth, because we would always find faults
Only one thing is necessary for our submission; if a brother is before us in the Lord, we should listen to him
God's Word says, 'Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching'
For a person to learn submission he must learn to submit to all the ones who are before him not only to those who are immediately above him
He must learn to submit to those leading him, not only to the elderly who are particularly gifted and used by the Lord
When three or five brothers gather together even for two or three hours, spontaneously one will be manifested to be God's appointed leader
As soon as you sit down with ten or twenty brothers, you should immediately identify those who are ahead of you
Every Christian should find many who are ahead of him, who are weighty spiritually and who can render him spiritual guidance
Finally, we have seen that the elders in the Lord, those who take the lead among us, also represent the Body of Christ
If we practice this, the Lord's name and His word will be magnified in our midst, and we will be Philadelphia indeed
As a result of the spread of the gospel to many nations, men have developed different views concerning Christianity
The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners
The Lord Jesus acted in exactly the opposite way of John the Baptist, yet He was not opposed to John the Baptist
Some people hold on to the little outward things that they have, but they have nothing within them to back them up
The Lord rebuked Martha not because she was laboring but because she was too busy she even implored the Lord to send her sister to help her
Paul said that the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit
Madam Guyon once said that a man who is in perfect union with God is a teacher to the elderly and a friend to children
What is within us is far greater and more glorious, and we should not be affected by the outward mode of living in any way
To wait for His return means that while we live as others do, we have an expectation of His return always within us
They study the Lord's return and believe in His return, but this does not mean that they are expecting His return
Many people are very familiar with the prophecies concerning the Lord's return, but they are not necessarily waiting for His return
Those who pay attention to society are disturbed to see many social ills such as crime, sickness, poverty, and inequality still prevailing
Heaven is not merely related to the matter of individual salvation; it relates to a time when the whole world will turn to Christ
The cow and the bear will graze; / Their young will lie down together; / And the lion will eat straw like the ox'
We are not called to engage ourselves in the work of the League of Nations; our work is not to help weak and struggling countries
The angels one day will proclaim that the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ
In the same way, today Christians should labor on individuals; they should not try to build up any system or institution
If we do not belong to this world and do not settle down in this world, that day will be of unspeakable glory to us
Isaiah 11:4 says that the Lord will 'judge the poor in righteousness, / And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land'
Ezekiel 47:12 says that in the new heaven and new earth, the tree of the new city will be for the healing of the nations
Isaiah 43:19-20 and 35:1 speak of God making 'rivers in the desert' and of the desert blossoming 'like the rose'
While we remain on earth, we should do what we need to do, but our hearts should always be set on the Lord's return
If the church is not separated from the world, it would be useless to speak about baptism or separation from the world
God's children must stand on the ground of what they preach before they can lead new believers to the same ground
If everyone casts every consideration aside and gives his all, we can expect new ones to cast every consideration aside and give their all
A locality must be assured that its believers are very much strengthened before it can expect this practice to be accepted smoothly
In other words, the Lord told him that in order to follow Him, a man has to follow Him absolutely all the way; he cannot lack one thing
When the Lord saw this, He remarked, 'How difficult it will be for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God'!
A little while later the Lord said that a rich man entering God's kingdom is like a camel going through the eye of a needle
In the same principle, everyone in this world loves money; it is impossible for anyone to sell all his possessions
The central subject of this passage is the sentence 'The things that are impossible with men are possible with God'
The Lord showed the disciples that following Him means giving up everything for His sake and for the gospel's sake
A young person must see that in order to serve God, he has to set aside, sell, or give up everything before he can follow the Lord
Like Peter, James, and John, these ones hear the Lord's calling, and they follow the Lord instantly and absolutely
Of the thirteen, eleven were good, one was false-Judas, and the remaining one, the thirteenth one, was the young ruler
Humanly speaking, he was a traitor because he collaborated with the Roman Empire to extort from his own countrymen
He did not tell him, 'You should not have extorted from others,' or 'You should not have sinned or become greedy'
According to common sense, an old man should be stingy with money while a young man should be generous with it
Chapter eighteen tells us that with men it is impossible, while chapter nineteen tells us that with God it is possible
He did not give in a little one day, a little the next day, a little more the third day, until he no longer held anything back
The Lord said that it was not Zaccheus's decision, struggle, consideration, or endeavor that made him willing to sell all
Why was his house, which had been built up through years of savings, gambles, and sacrifice of honor, stripped bare in an instant?
In verse 5 the Lord said, 'I must stay in your house,' and in verse 9 He said, 'Today salvation has come to this house'
The main thing we should note in Acts 2 and 4 is that the believers had all things in common at the beginning of the church life
Properties, houses, as well as other forms of tangible assets such as jade, antiques, and calligraphy collections must be sold
In regard to the rest of your belongings, whatever you need to keep to take care of your daily necessities does not have to be sold
By the time of Pentecost, in the first revival, three thousand and five thousand spontaneously sold what they had
The Lord said that no one can do this, yet you have come up with something that is more miraculous than a miracle'
We should give new believers a proper understanding of the subject so that they can build up a proper defense against it
We said that only one church will keep the Lord's word and His name in the end times-the church in Philadelphia
God's children do not need to become involved in a heresy, only to find out later that it is a heresy and then condemn it
Only those who are sober will save themselves from danger; those who are curious will always suffer the poisonous sting
If you are in a place without a church or if you are alone, here are ten criteria for you to test whether a teaching is heretical
If any of the ten criteria fits the description or if a person teaches any of these ten things, you have a heresy
What determines a group as heretical or not is not the volume of teachings it produces, but the presence or absence of heresy
Some have to do with prophecies, some with questions related to judgment after death, and some with mortification of fleshly lusts
Throughout the ages, many heresies have concentrated their attack on one or more aspects of the Lord Jesus' person
If anyone says that Christ is a Spirit subordinate to God and superior to the angels, who came to earth to be a man, he is preaching heresy
Verse 3, which is the same as 1 Corinthians 12:3, says, 'Every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God'
Jesus Christ's coming in the flesh involves His history on earth, while His becoming the Lord involves His history in glory
The word used in the Bible for destroy is the same as the word used for ruined in the bursting of the old wineskins
If a person says that a day is always a year, then the millennium would be a period of three hundred and sixty thousand years
All those who predict the day of Christ's return based on the 'day-year' theory are in danger of being heretical
According to Deuteronomy 18:9-14 and Leviticus 20:6, God strictly forbids the living to communicate with the dead
For a dead man to return to the land of the living or for the living to communicate with the dead is to engage in divination
The laws of Moses forbade a woman from communicating with spirits, and those who did so were to be stoned to death
When the Lord does not come as predicted, men begin to ignore or despise the very truth concerning the Lord's second coming
If anyone does not pass any of the above ten tests, he is a heretic, and we must not have any fellowship with him
