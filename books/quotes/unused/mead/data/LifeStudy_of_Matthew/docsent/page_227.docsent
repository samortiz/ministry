   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the Lord s answer to His disciples question is of three sections: the section concerning the Jews 24:4-31 , the section concerning the church 24:32 25:30 , and the section concerning the Gentiles 25:31-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The section concerning Israel is divided into two parts: from Christ s ascension to the end of the age 24:1-14 and during the end of the age 24:15-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to understand 24:1-31, we must keep these subsections in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must also be careful not to misapply the verses, that is, not to apply them to the wrong time or to the wrong people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christian teachers do not understand the significance of the term the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek phrase here can also be translated the completion of the age or the consummation of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The end of the age denotes the three and a half years of the great tribulation that will terminate this age.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the end of the age is not the close of the age, but the very last period of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to understand the prophecies in the Old and New Testaments, we must have a clear understanding of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christian teachers are confused regarding the prophecies because they are not clear about the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This term the consummation of the age is found in the last verse of Matthew 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we hope to be raptured, we expect the Lord to be with us until the end of this age, not until the close of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the close of the age, the Lord will descend to the earth and place His feet on the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before this takes place, there will be a period of time which the Bible calls the end of the age, a period of time which will last three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 24:6 the Lord told His disciples that they would hear of wars and rumors of wars, but that the end is not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He told them not to be disturbed, for such things were but the beginning of birth pangs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The end of the age, the great tribulation, was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 14 He said that the gospel of the kingdom would be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations and then the end would come.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 6 He said that the end was not yet, but in verse 14 He said that the end would come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to remember that 24:1-14 speaks of the things between Christ s ascension and the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these verses must be applied to the Jews during this period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. At the End of the Age</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we come to 24:15-31.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These verses describe the things that will happen at the end of the age, during the last three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The end of the age begins with verse 15.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Remember, this chapter speaks especially about the sign of the Lord s coming and the sign of the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 14 indicates that a strong sign of the end of the age is the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When this has been accomplished, we should realize that the last three and a half years are about to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom will be the greatest sign of the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prior to this preaching, many other things will have taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But these things are not the signs of the end of the age, for in speaking about them the Lord said that the end was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to all the inhabited earth will be the unique sign of the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Immediately after the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, the events described in verse 15 will take place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Great Tribulation a. The Image of the Antichrist</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the prophecy in verses 15 through 31 concerning the remnant of the Jews will definitely be fulfilled in the last three and a half years of this age, the time of the great tribulation, the second half of the last week prophesied in Daniel 9:27.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It will begin with the setting of Antichrist s image the idol in the temple v. 15 and end with Christ s open coming v. 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Abomination means an idol Deut 29:17 .</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The setting up of the idol will mark the beginning of the great tribulation, the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are many Christians who are not clear about the phrase the abomination of desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we have seen, the abomination here refers to an idol, the image of Antichrist set up in the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to Revelation 13, this image will be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before that time, no idol will be able to speak.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The abomination, the idol of Antichrist, will cause desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Antichrist is called the destroyer Apollyon, Rev 9:11 ; he will do much destroying Dan 8:13, 23-25; 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as Antichrist sets up his image and forces people to worship it, he will begin to destroy all religious things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, this idol will provoke the Lord s anger, and He will come in to destroy Antichrist and his army.</S>
