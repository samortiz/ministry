   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THE SECRET OF JOSEPH'S RELEASE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND EXALTATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This message is a parenthesis covering the secret of Joseph's release and exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. JOSEPH BECOMING QUALIFIED IN AGE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AFTER THE FURTHER SUFFERING OF TWO YEARS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When some read chapter forty, they may have the desire to speak to the Lord on Joseph's behalf and ask the Lord why He kept Joseph in prison for such a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Joseph was seventeen or eighteen years of age when he was first put into prison, and he was about twenty-eight years of age when he interpreted the dreams of his two companions in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although he had been in the dungeon for at least ten years prior to the release of his companions, his own dreams still had not yet been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps you would say, "Lord, this is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have tested Joseph for ten years already.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why didn't You release him when You released his two companions?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Joseph had interpreted the dream of the cupbearer, he asked the cupbearer to remember him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the cupbearer forgot Joseph, and nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, it is easy for men to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But You are God, and You cannot forget things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why did You keep Joseph in prison for another two years?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day I was enlightened to see that Joseph remained in prison for another two full years 41:1 because it was necessary for him to reach the age of thirty 41:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today many young people expect to be released from their cage as soon as they turn eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But according to the Bible, we need to reach the age, not of eighteen or even twenty-eight, but of thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who served God as priests began to do so in a full way at the age of thirty Num 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ones under thirty were apprentices, not fully functioning priests Num 8:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord Jesus began to minister, He also was thirty years of age Luke 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, if Joseph had come to the throne at the age of twenty-eight, he would not have typified Christ in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He had to be thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After I saw this, I was convinced that these further two years were necessary for Joseph to be qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If he had not stayed there for two additional years, he would have been under age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Young people, no matter how long your trial may be, do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You need to recognize that your trial is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one can be enthroned without being tried and tested.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we like to be enthroned immediately, God would say, "The time is not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not talk to Me about enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need to be put into the dungeon."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you seek the Lord, the Lord will put you into a dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps all who are around you your wife, your children, the elders, and the brothers and sisters intend to respect you; however, whatever they do only serves to put you into a dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have nothing to say about this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the dungeon, we cannot ascend to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not be a dungeon dropout; stay in the dungeon until you graduate and receive the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You need the last two years.</S>
