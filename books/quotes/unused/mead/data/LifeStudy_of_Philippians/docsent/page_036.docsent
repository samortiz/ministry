   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN HOLDING FORTH CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 2:14-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider 2:14-16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These verses continue Paul s word about working out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 12 Paul charges us to work out our salvation, and in verse 13 he tells us that God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now in verse 14 Paul issues a warning: Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Murmurings are out of our emotion, mostly on the part of the sisters; reasonings are out of our mind, mostly on the part of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent, from experiencing Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The context indicates that if we murmur or reason, we do not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Obedience to God slays all murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to work out our salvation, we must obey the very God who operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He Himself is our salvation, and our obedience to Him is the working out of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sisters need to realize that when they murmur, they disobey the God who works within them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, the brothers need to see that whenever they reason, they are rebellious against the One who operates in them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only by obedience can murmurings and reasonings be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul s word in 2:14 about murmurings and reasonings is a further indication that his purpose in writing the book of Philippians was not related to doctrine, but very much related to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Murmurings and reasonings are important factors that frustrate our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From experience Paul knew that if we would work out our salvation, we need to do all things without murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Often in important matters we may not murmur or reason.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in small matters we are prone to murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Any kind of murmuring or reasoning is disobedience to the inner working of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How we need the Lord to save us from our murmurings and reasonings!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 15 Paul continues, That you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek word rendered that means in order that.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should do all things without murmurings and reasonings in order that we may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek word translated guileless also means simple, artless, innocent; hence, harmless Matt 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It comes from a root which means unmixed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word blameless describes our outward behavior, and the word guileless, our inward character.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be artless means not to play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one who is political can rightly be called guileless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are artless, we are also guileless and harmless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 15 Paul refers to children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As children of God, we have God s life and nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being children of God with the divine life and nature, we are luminaries which reflect the light of the sun Christ .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As such, we are without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without blemish is the total quality of being blameless and guileless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Greek word translated perverted means warped or twisted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There can be no doubt that today s generation is twisted and warped.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this kind of generation we should shine as lights in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 16 Paul goes on to say, Holding forth the word of life, for my boasting in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain nor labored in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Greek word for holding forth also means applying, presenting, offering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As God s children, we need to present the word of life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the Philippian believers did this, Paul would be able to boast in the day of Christ that he had not labored in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The day of Christ is the day of the Lord s second coming, also called the day of the Lord 1 Thes 5:2; 2 Thes 2:2; 1 Cor 1:8; 2 Cor 1:14 and that day 2 Tim 1:18; 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In that day all believers will appear before the judgment seat of Christ to receive the reward each deserves 2 Cor 5:10; Matt 25:19-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just as the Philippians could boast in Paul in Christ, so Paul wanted to be able to boast, rejoice, and glory in them in the day of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He hoped to be able to boast that, as far as they were concerned, he had not run in vain or labored in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, at the time Paul wrote this Epistle, he was concerned that his running and labor might be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether or not his labor was actually in vain would be determined by the deeds of the believers in Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose the believers there did all things without murmurings or reasonings and thus became blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a warped and twisted generation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose, moreover, that the saints in Philippi were shining forth as luminaries in the world and presented the word of life to those around them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If such were their situation, Paul would be able to rejoice and even boast at the time of the Lord s coming back.</S>
