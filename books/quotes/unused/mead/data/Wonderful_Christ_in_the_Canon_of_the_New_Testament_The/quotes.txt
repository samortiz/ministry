[1]  The Wonderful Christ in the Canon of the New Testament CONTENTS
[2]  The Seed, the Root, the Branch, and the Fruit
[3]  AND THE FRUIT Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15; 22:18; 2 Sam 7:12-14a; Isa 4:2; 11:1-2, 10; 53:2; Jer 23:5-6; Zech 6:12-13; Matt 1:17, 20-21, 23; 16:13-17; 18:20; 28:19-20 A WONDERFUL PERSON WITH WONDERFUL NAMES
[4]  Then we have another verse which speaks about the seed of Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed Gen 22:18 .
[5]  In the seed of Abraham, all the nations, not only Israel, shall be blessed.
[6]  Now we must see that this seed, Jesus, eventually becomes the branch, and this branch is called the Lord our righteousness.
[7]  This is Jesus, and as the seed, the branch, and the fruit, He is so subjective to us.
[8]  All these points are fully revealed in the Old Testament, but not merely in an objective way.
[9]  We all know that Jesus was crucified on the cross for us, and now He is resurrected and sitting on the throne in the third heavens as the Lord of all.
[10]  When the divine seed entered into human soil, the issue was a person who is the mingling of divinity with humanity.
[11]  Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us Matt 1:21, 23 .
[12]  When I come in, Jesus comes in. When you come in, He comes in. When we all come in, Jesus comes in. When we say, Amen, He is amening within us and within our amen.
[13]  Since I was a little boy, I learned to sing that little hymn, Jesus Loves Me, This I Know, For the Bible Tells Me So.
[14]  CHAPTER TWO THE ALL-INCLUSIVE BREAD Scripture Reading: Isa 7:14; 9:6; 32:2; 40:5, 9; 53:2; Matt 1:20b; John 1:1, 14; 14:10; 6:53, 57, 63 THE REVELATION OF CHRIST
[15]  Since the fall of man, Christ began to be revealed in a very strange and wonderful way.
[16]  In Genesis 3:15, immediately after the fall, He is revealed as the seed of a woman.
[17]  Then He is later revealed as the root, which, as we know, issues from the seed.
[18]  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God John 1:1 .
[19]  Now we must see that for God to be our enjoyment, there was the need of the process of incarnation.
[20]  If God was not incarnated, He could never have been our food.
[21]  When Jesus said that He was the bread of life, He was already processed.
[22]  There is a word which I do not like to use, but for lack of a better one I will use it.
[23]  COMING FOR THE BRIDE Scripture Reading: Matt 9:15; 25:1, 6; 28:19-20; John 3:29; 14:17-20; 15:5; Gal 3:27; 1 Cor 12:13
[24]  In the past two chapters we have seen some exhaustless matters concerning Christ.
[25]  This is why we have four Gospels, or four biographies, to tell us who Christ is, and what kind of person He is.
[26]  Furthermore, we must realize that not only the composition of the Scriptures is God s breathing, but also the arrangement of the books.
[27]  If we try to understand Matthew and John with our limited mentality, we will only be confused.
[28]  Matthew wrote a book about Christ in which he tells us that He is the son of David and the son of Abraham.
[29]  But John tells us that He is the Word, and the Word is God.
[30]  John makes it clear that He is the Son of God.
[31]  As the Spirit, He is so available that we may breathe Him in, and we may receive Him so easily.
[32]  The Bible says in Romans 10:12 that the Lord is rich unto all that call upon His name.
[33]  So the way to breathe Him in is to call on Him: O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!
[34]  This is why, whenever there is a person who will call on the name of the Lord Jesus, something happens.
[35]  But we must all know that the Jesus who is on the throne in the third heavens at the right hand of God is now so real as the Spirit on the earth.
[36]  He died on the cross for our sins and shed His blood.
[37]  Then He was resurrected, and by resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[38]  CHAPTER FOUR THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 2:19-23; 3:15; 4:1, 3, 4, 12-16; 11:19, 25-30; 12:6, 8, 19-20, 41b, 42b; 13:55-57; 16:18; 18:17; 21:42; 28:19
[39]  The Scriptures are a record of a wonderful person.
[40]  I believe that in the past three messages, we have seen what a wonderful person the Lord Jesus is.
[41]  Before producing the church, He was the individual Christ, but after producing the church, this wonderful person becomes the Body-Christ.
[42]  Whatever Jesus was, and whatever He was called was only for the purpose of dispensing Himself in God s chosen people, that they might be converted and transformed into His Body, the church.
[43]  Eventually in the Gospel of Matthew, He says, I will build my church.
[44]  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .
[45]  To build the church is not simply to bring people to the Lord, that they may obtain some kind of church membership.
[46]  Then, once Christ is in us, He will transform us from our natural being into something else.
[47]  In Matthew 4 Jesus was led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
[48]  And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
[49]  But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Matt 4:2-4 .
[50]  Jesus life is a life that is always feeding on God s Word.
[51]  If you say that Jesus is within you, yet you do not daily eat the Word of God, that is not Jesus, that is you.
[52]  If we would be a Nazarene, neglected by religion and persecuted by politics, fulfilling all righteousness by taking Jesus as our life and daily feeding on the living Word of God, we will become a light.
[53]  But since we take Jesus as the Nazarene and our life within, and we are willing to suffer persecution and be right in everything by feeding on the Word of God, our family will be full of light.
[54]  Jesus is the greater temple with the presence of God, the greater Jonah with the power of God, and the greater Solomon with the wisdom of God.
[55]  We do have such a wonderful person living in us!
[56]  The record that Matthew gives us of Christ is not superficial.
[57]  Most Christians simply realize that Matthew tells us Christ was born of a virgin to be our Savior, He was crucified for our sins, He was buried and resurrected, and now He is our redeemer.
[58]  There is nothing wrong with Him in any aspect.
[59]  When we look at Him, we see that He is righteous in every way.
[60]  During this time Jesus revealed Himself to the people as the greater Temple 12:6 , the greater Jonah 12:44 , the greater Solomon 12:42 , and the Lord of the Sabbath 12:8 .
[61]  Many Christians love the Gospel of John because it tells us that Jesus is the life, the truth, the way, the door, and so many other things.
[62]  John did not tell us that Jesus was the greater Solomon.
[63]  Neither did he tell us that Jesus was the Lord of the Sabbath.
[64]  Another point about Christ which we must see is that He saved others, but He would not save Himself.
[65]  Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
[66]  This Christ into Whom we have been baptized is the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is just the processed God for us to participate in. We all have been baptized into such a Christ.
[67]  In Matthew 28:19 the Lord tells us to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[68]  To understand this, we must also read Galatians 3:27, For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[69]  By these two verses we can see that to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is equivalent to being baptized into Christ.
[70]  CHAPTER SIX THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS Scripture Reading: Matt 2:1-2; 4:17; 5:3, 20; 7:21-23; 9:35; 13:3; 15:26-27; 16:18-19; 18:17-18; 21:4-5; 27:37; 28:18-19
[71]  Bible teachers hardly have any debates concerning the Gospel of John.
[72]  The Brethren teachers say that Jesus came as a king to present the kingdom of God to the Jewish people, but since they rejected Him, the kingdom was suspended.
[73]  To understand this, we must first of all comprehend God s eternal purpose.
[74]  Then God created man in His own image with the intention that this corporate man would be His expression and would exercise His authority over all the earth.
[75]  What is the way to open the kingdom and establish the church?
[76]  It is by imparting King Jesus as the seed of the kingdom into others.
[77]  Jesus is the king, and He is the seed of the kingdom.
[78]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE Scripture Reading: John 1:42, 51; 2:19-21; 3:29-30; 10:16; 12:24; 15:1, 5; 17:21-23 WITH US AND AMONG US
[79]  In this message, we must come to the Gospel of John.
[80]  Matthew says that Jesus is the King, and John says that Jesus is the Son of God and even God Himself.
[81]  Here Matthew tells us that Jesus is God with us.
[82]  There is also another similarity in these two Gospels.
[83]  Neither John nor Matthew mention the Lord s public ascension.
[84]  Almost all Christians have common knowledge that the Lord Jesus went to the Father after His resurrection.
[85]  This Gospel ends by the Lord telling us that He will be with us unto the completion of the age.
[86]  He came to be God with us, and He promised that He would be with us unto the completion of the age.
[87]  In the first chapter of John, the Lord Jesus was introduced to the people by John the Baptist.
[88]  After this, two of John s disciples followed the Lord Jesus.
[89]  And he brought him to Jesus, and when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone John 1:42 .
[90]  Nathanael was brought to the Lord by Philip, and the Lord told him: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man John 1:51 .
[91]  This means that Jesus Himself is the ladder that connects the earth to the heavens, and He is going to make all of us stones for the building up of Bethel, God s house on the earth.
[92]  When Jesus was resurrected, we were all resurrected in Him and with Him Eph 2:6 , and it is by this resurrection that Jesus will build up a spiritual house for God.
[93]  And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.
[94]  Matthew and John are different in many aspects, but as we have seen in the last message, they are also very much alike.
[95]  One reveals that Jesus is the king, and the other shows us that Jesus is the very God.
[96]  In the New Testament, there are two books that reveal that God is Triune more clearly.
[97]  In the first book of the New Testament, Matthew, we see how God became incarnated, born of a virgin, to be a man called Jesus Matt 1:21-23 .
[98]  In this Gospel, the Lord Jesus speaks of how He was sent by the Father, and that He can do nothing of Himself: I can of mine own self do nothing:...I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me John 5:30 .
[99]  The Lord Jesus also mentions in the Gospel of John that when the Son speaks, the Father does the works: Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works John 14:10 .
[100]  The Triune God is clearly revealed in the Gospels of Matthew and John more than any other books in the Bible.
[101]  Of course, there are some verses in the Epistles which show us the Trinity.
[102]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
[103]  There is another portion of John which we must see.
[104]  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of reality, is come, he will guide you into all reality: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.
[105]  The Lord Jesus says that the Spirit will speak nothing of Himself, just as the Son spoke nothing of Himself.
[106]  The Father is in the Son, and the Son is now the speaking Spirit, reaching us, indwelling us, making everything of the Son so real to us, and applying all the Son is to us.
[107]  This is the Triune God living as one within us, and we all are one, living in the Triune God.
[108]  CHAPTER NINE THE INAUGURATION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Acts 1:9-11; 2:22-24, 32-36; 3:13-15; 4:10-12; 5:30-32; 7:55-56; 10:36b; Heb 1:2-3; Phil 2:9-11; Eph 1:20-23; 4:7-12
[109]  Our burden in these chapters is to continue to see the wonderful Person of Christ.
[110]  In the previous chapters we have seen Christ in the four Gospels.
[111]  That brought us from the incarnation to the resurrection of Christ.
[112]  In the Lord s ascension and exaltation to the highest, He was given a name that is above all names, a name to which every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.
[113]  Some may argue that the name Jesus was given to Him at the time of His birth.
[114]  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father Phil 2:9-11 .
[115]  John 20 tells us that on the resurrection morning Mary Magdalene began to touch Him, but the Lord told her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God v. 17 . Then on the evening of the same day He openly showed His disciples His hands and His side and bid them to handle Him Luke 24:39 . Therefore, He must have had a secret ascension to the Father on that same day.
[116]  Now we know the meaning of the ascension of Christ.
[117]  It was also by the ascension that Jesus became the official Savior.
[118]  Therefore, He was authorized by God to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
[119]  The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
[120]  Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins Acts 5:30-31 .
[121]  FOR THE BUILDING OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Acts 2:32-33, 36; 4:10-12; 5:40-41; Phil 2:9-11; Eph 1:20-23; 4:7-12
[122]  Very few Christians have ever paid much attention to the ascension of Christ.
[123]  Of course, even the attention that has been paid to the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ has not been adequate.
[124]  This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses....Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ Acts 2:32, 36 .
[125]  It is not that God is the Lord of all, but that a man by the name of Jesus has been made the Lord of all.
[126]  He is also the anointed One, the Christ, as well as the Author, the Originator, and the Savior.
[127]  The first is in chapter one: Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all Eph 1:20-23 .
[128]  This portion of Ephesians tells us that God raised up Christ and exalted Him above all, putting all things under His feet, and giving Him to be the head over all things to the church.
[129]  In the whole universe, God has a great project to accomplish: that is, to build the New Jerusalem.
[130]  Then, when Christ was exalted to the Father at the time of His ascension, the Father made Him to be the Author of life, He gave Him the Spirit, and He gave Him all the gifts.
[131]  God made Christ the Author of life in order that Christ would take all His chosen people and put His divine life into every one of them.
[132]  But one day while he was on his way to suppress the believers of the Lord, the wonderful Lord came to him, and he was knocked to the ground.
[133]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Acts 1:5, 8; 2:4, 17a, 21, 33, 38; 10:44-47; 11:15-16; 1 Cor 12:12-14; Gal 3:27-28
[134]  We have seen that with Christ first of all there is the incarnation.
[135]  Following this we have the crucifixion, resurrection, and then the ascension.
[136]  He was positioned, authorized, and inaugurated into His post to carry out God s project of building God s eternal dwelling place.
[137]  Some say that the Father, who has a person, is one God, and the Son, who also has a person, is another God, but the Spirit, who does not have a person, is merely an influence, not another God.
[138]  The third mystery in the New Testament is the matter of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
[139]  Second Corinthians 3:17 says, Now the Lord is that Spirit, and 1 Corinthians 15:45 says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit A.S.V. . Then is there no difference between Christ and the Holy Spirit? Surely there is some difference.
[140]  It is Christ putting all of God s chosen people into Himself as the Spirit.
[141]  For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit A.S.V. . This verse says that we all were baptized in one Spirit into one Body.
[142]  This is what Paul meant when he said, So many... were baptized into Jesus Christ Rom 6:3 , and As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[143]  First Corinthians 12:3 says, Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit Gk.
[144]  CHAPTER TWELVE ONCE FOR ALL Scripture Reading: Matt 3:11; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4; 8:14-18; 9:17-18; 10:44-47; 11:15-17; 19:1-6; Mark 16:16-18
[145]  In the Bible we see clearly that God had an eternal purpose in eternity past to work Himself into a group of human beings, that He might be their life, nature, and everything, and that they might be His corporate expression.
[146]  The Bible calls this corporate expression the Body of Christ, the church, the house of God.
[147]  Ultimately this corporate entity will consummate in the New Jerusalem, the eternal expression of God in a corporate way.
[148]  The regulating lines of the Bible are God s eternal purpose of working Himself into us that He may be our content, and we may be His expression.
[149]  We all must realize that all the major steps taken by the Lord are once for all.
[150]  Some so-called Pentecostals and charismatics say that on the day of Pentecost all spoke in tongues, but let us look carefully at the verses.
[151]  And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance Acts 2:4 .
[152]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE PROPER EXERCISE OF THE GIFTS Scripture Reading: Acts 2:17-21; 1 Cor 12:7-11, 27-31; 13:1, 2, 8, 11; 14:1, 5-6, 12, 18-19, 23-26, 31-32 AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT
[153]  From the past messages in the last issue, we have seen what the baptism in the Holy Spirit is.
[154]  It is simply Christ putting His Body into the Spirit, which means into Himself.
[155]  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[156]  Now we must go on to see the exercise of the gifts.
[157]  When they come into our meetings, the first thing they look for is whether there is the speaking of tongues with interpretation or not.
[158]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17a; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:9-10; Gal 1:15-16; 2:20a; 4:19; Eph 3:17a; Phil 1:20b-21a; Col 1:27
[159]  We have seen Christ is the wonderful One with six major steps.
[160]  Incarnation is the mingling of divinity with humanity, crucifixion is the termination of all negative things, resurrection is the germination of all positive things, ascension is the inauguration of Christ, baptism is the putting of us all into Christ for the formation of the Body, and the advent is the Lord s return to this earth.
[161]  We have seen the six major steps of Christ, but we must realize that six in the Bible is not a good number.
[162]  Today s Jesus is a present Jesus, a constant Jesus, an instant Jesus, a ready Jesus, and an available Jesus.
[163]  This is the Lord s indwelling between His baptism and His coming back.
[164]  By His baptism He puts us all into Him.
[165]  By His coming He will take us as His Bride.
[166]  Another important verse is 1 Corinthians 6:17, But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
[167]  We are not only one with the Lord, we are one spirit with the Lord.
[168]  The Lord today is the life-giving Spirit, and we have a human spirit purposely created by God that we may take Christ as the life-giving Spirit into us.
[169]  Then Romans 8:9-10 tells us that this Christ in our spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God.
[170]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5; 2 Cor 2:10b; 10:1; 11:10; Rom 8:4; Gal 5:25; 2 Cor 3:18 POSITIONED TO DRINK
[171]  Thus we were put into a position that fits His work.
[172]  His intention is not merely to put us into Himself, but to put us into Himself for His working within us.
[173]  After putting us into Himself, He started His work within us.
[174]  To put us into Christ is one thing; to make us to drink Christ into us is another thing.
[175]  Next we saw through Galatians 2:20 that we have been crucified with Christ, nevertheless we live, yet it is not we, but Christ who lives in us.
[176]  This is why the teachings concerning marriage life do not work so well.
[177]  Regardless of what kind of teaching we have, we still hold on to our own person.
[178]  Eventually, Paul gives us such a deep verse in 2 Corinthians 2:10.
[179]  To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ.
[180]  Could you say that you are going there in the person of Christ?
[181]  When you buy something there, could you say that you are buying it in the person of Christ?
[182]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE ONE NEW MAN AS THE BODY-CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; 2:15-16; 4:4-6, 13-16, 22-24; 1 Cor 12:12-13; 1:9-10; Rom 15:5-6 ONE MIND AND ONE MOUTH
[183]  When we are all taking Him as our person, the real oneness is brought in. Romans 15:6 says, That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[184]  Forty-eight years ago I picked up many doctrines.
[185]  I was so sure that I was right, but I was just a little frog in a well with a narrow opening.
[186]  According to the past messages on the indwelling Christ and this message on the new man, we can see that all the members of this new man will be wholly filled up by Christ.
[187]  We will even be saturated, permeated, and covered with Christ.
[188]  Thus we shall all become a corporate Christ, because the Body is Christ.
[189]  For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.
[190]  He was God, He became flesh for redemption, and He became the life-giving Spirit to come into us and work within us.
[191]  In the beginning of the Bible we see God creating the heavens and the earth, but at the end of the Bible, God is in the Lamb surrounded by a city.
[192]  As we read on through the Bible we see that although man becomes fallen, God redeems him through the cross and becomes the life-giving Spirit to get into him.
[193]  ON THE PROPER GROUND Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; 1 Cor 1:2; 3:9b, 11, 12a; Gal 1:2, 20-22; 4:11-12, 16; 1 Pet 2:2, 5; Rev 1:11; 2:7; 21:2, 18-19a THE ENLARGEMENT OF CHRIST
[194]  In these messages we have seen God s purpose and plan, which is to work Himself into us that we might be built up into the one new man.
[195]  In the beginning of the Bible God was alone, but He had the desire to have a counterpart.
[196]  Everyone knows that to build a proper building there is the need of the proper materials.
[197]  Regardless of what people say, we love to call on the name of the Lord.
[198]  If we are in darkness, the best way to get out of that darkness is to call on the name of the Lord.
[199]  Perhaps you and I would like to come together for the proper building up of the church, but so many brothers and sisters do not like to come together.
[200]  Since so many free groups have picked up the name of the local church, we must discern what a proper local church is.
[201]  A proper local church is one that is open to all the real saints in the city where they are, as well as open to all the other local churches in this country and throughout the world.
[202]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rev 1:4, 5a; 4:5; 5:6; 2:1, 7a, 8, 11a, 12, 17a, 18, 29; 3:1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22; 14:13b; 19:10b; 22:17; Zech 4:2, 4-6
[203]  In the past few chapters in this book we have seen Christ as the wonderful One in the four Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles.
[204]  Now we must come to the last part of the New Testament, the book of Revelation.
[205]  When we come to the Word, many times we simply cannot see the things that are there.
[206]  By this verse we are clear that in the beginning Christ was God.
[207]  It is sad that today there are some so-called Christians who do not believe that Christ is God.
[208]  The first reason was that He could be our Redeemer.
[209]  John 1:29 then tells us that He is the Lamb of God.
[210]  In the Acts there is the sprouting of the seed.
[211]  Why is there the need of the sevenfold intensification of the one unique Holy Spirit?
[212]  It is because at the time of the writing of the book of Revelation, the church had become degraded.
[213]  On the day of Pentecost the church was initiated, and for the accomplishing of the proper church life there was the need of elders and deacons, as well as certain regulations.
[214]  Religion is to worship God, to do good, to help others, and to adjust and correct yourself all without Christ.
[215]  Anything that is good for God or man, yet without Christ, is religion.
[216]  In the church life we must not do anything without Christ.
[217]  AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rev 1:10-18, 20; 4:5b; 5:6b; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10; John 4:24; 6:63; 3:6b; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17; 12:12-13; Zech 3:8b-9; 4:2, 6; 12:1
[218]  The Bible is not only the holy Word, but also the divine Word.
[219]  We also need a bird s eye view of the whole Bible.
[220]  If we detach a part from the whole, it is difficult to understand.
[221]  Gen 1:1 , and the Bible ends with the New Jerusalem Rev 21 22 , which is the Holy City, the Bride, the tabernacle of God.
[222]  Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours 1 Cor 1:2 .
[223]  For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,...that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man: that Christ may make his home in your hearts by faith Eph 3:14, 16-17a, Gk.
[224]  In the book of Revelation it is altogether a matter of the Spirit.
[225]  There is nothing to do with forms, regulations, or any kind of religion.
[226]  If we argue with our mentality, we miss the mark.
[227]  We have a strong base for the things we minister.
[228]  We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, that He died on the cross for our sins and was literally resurrected from the dead.
[229]  CHAPTER TWENTY EATING JESUS FOR GOD S BUILDING Scripture Reading: Rev 1:13-18; 2:4, 7, 14, 15, 17, 20, 24, 26, 28; 3:12, 20 THE HIGH PRIEST AMONG THE CHURCHES
[230]  By reading Revelation, especially the first three chapters, we can see what a wonderful One He is.
[231]  In chapter one we see Him as the Son of Man.
[232]  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God....He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it Rev 2:7, 17 .
[233]  He has all the virtues with no shortage whatsoever.
[234]  He is not only the ancient One, but also the living One.
[235]  In the same way, I do not care that much for doctrine.
[236]  As long as I have Christ, I have the real gold.
[237]  Jesus said, I am the living one, and was dead; and, behold, I am living forevermore Rev 1:18 .
[238]  Therefore, He can be the tree of life to us.
[239]  The religious concept is doctrine, but the living Christ s concept is that we may eat of Him.
[240]  To whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ 1 Peter 2:2-5, Gk.
[241]  Scripture Reading: Rev 1:14b, 16b, 20; 2:28; 4:5; 10:1; 12:1; 18:1; 21:10-11, 23-24, 25b; John 1:4; 8:12; 9:5; 1 John 1:6-7; Eph 5:13-14
[242]  All the points of God s revelation were sown as seeds in the book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible.
[243]  Why is the order of life and light reversed in the Gospel of John?
[244]  But in God s regeneration, life comes first and light follows.
[245]  Before the Lord comes back to enlighten the whole world, He is now walking among the local churches shining over us.
[246]  The church life is not only full of life, but also full of light.
[247]  If you still can tell a lie, I doubt if you are in the real church life.
[248]  In the church age, the lamps are the seven Spirits, but when we arrive in the New Jerusalem, the lamp will be the Lamb.
[249]  And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof Rev 21:23, Gk.
[250]  This means that God is in Christ, shining out over the city.
[251]  Christ is the lamp, and within this lamp is God as the light Therefore, Christ shines out God, and the city shines out Christ.
[252]  Then at the end of this book, there is the holy city, New Jerusalem, God s habitation for eternity.
[253]  In chapter nineteen, the marriage of the lamb is come, and His Bride has made herself ready with white linen Rev 19:7-8 .
[254]  This is really good, but it is not good enough.
[255]  The third aspect is that the church is God s farm.
[256]  This is what the Apostle Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 3:9.
[257]  A PROMISE TO EAT AND A CALL TO DRINK
[258]  Have you noticed that the book of Revelation closes with a promise and a call?
[259]  Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
[260]  By eating Jesus as the tree of life and by drinking the Spirit we will be strong to deal with the enemy of God.
[261]  It is also by eating Jesus and drinking of the Spirit that we will be adorned with the precious materials of gold, pearl, and precious stones that we might be built up together as the tabernacle of God.
[262]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD S BUILDING Scripture Reading: Gen 1:27; 2:9-12, 22; Matt 16:18a; Eph 2:20-22; 1 Cor 3:9b, 11-12a; 1 Pet 2:5; 2 Cor 3:18; 1 John 3:2; Phil 3:21; Rev 4:2-3; 21:11-13, 16-21 MAN FOR GOD S PURPOSE
[263]  In these messages we have clearly seen that the revelation of the Scriptures is progressive and consistent.
[264]  In Genesis 1, after God finished the work of His creation, He created man.
[265]  Our parents not only gave us man s image, but also man s life; but God in His creation only gave man His image, not His life.
[266]  The tree of life is good for food, and Jesus as the bread of life is also good for food.
[267]  The beginning of the Bible and the end of the Bible are much alike.
[268]  In Genesis 2, besides the tree, there is a river flowing in four directions Gen 2:9-10 .
[269]  As we read through the whole Bible, we begin to see that the tree of life is just God Himself presented to man in the form of food.
[270]  Then Paul tells us that we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit Eph 2:20-22, Gk.
[271]  . In these verses we see that all Christians are fitly framed together to grow into an holy temple in the Lord.
[272]  He says that we also are being built together locally into an habitation of God in spirit.
[273]  Around the New Jerusalem a wall is built with twelve foundations.
[274]  In Revelation 3:12, we have a good illustration: Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem.
[275]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE HARVEST OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Rev 21:1-21 THE ETERNAL HOLY OF HOLIES
[276]  The book of Revelation is a book of symbols, so to understand this book, we need to find the real meaning of all the symbols.
[277]  It is also a book that reaps all the seeds of the Bible.
[278]  It is altogether a mingling of God with man, and this mingling will be God s eternal Holy of Holies.
[279]  The church life is neither a building nor a place, but a group of God s chosen people mingled with God.
[280]  We all must look to the Lord with an unveiled face.
[281]  When we see Him thoroughly, we can reflect Him as a mirror.
[282]  By this we will be transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another.
[283]  In all of America there is not such a highway as this golden street.
[284]  It is a spiral that begins at the throne of God and the Lamb at the top of the mountain and spirals around until the last spiral covers all twelve gates.
[285]  The Triune God is dispensing Himself into us in our daily living as we walk in the divine nature, drink of the Holy Spirit, and eat Jesus as the tree of life.
