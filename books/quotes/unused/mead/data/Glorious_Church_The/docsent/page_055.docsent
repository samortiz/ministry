   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is another incident in the Old Testament which outstandingly manifests this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Israelites entered into the land of Canaan, the first person to commit sin was Achan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What was the sin which Achan committed?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said, "When I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle of Shinar...I coveted them and took them" Josh 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A Babylonian garment seduced Achan to commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does this beautiful garment imply?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A beautiful garment is worn for the sake of appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When one puts on a beautiful garment, it means that he adorns himself to improve his appearance and to add a little luster to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Achan's coveting of the Babylonian garment meant that he was seeking to improve himself, to make himself look better.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was Achan's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who were the first ones to commit sin in the New Testament, after the church began?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Scriptures reveal that they were Ananias and Sapphira.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What was the sin that they committed?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They lied to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They did not love the Lord very much, but they wanted to be looked upon as those who greatly loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were just pretending.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were not willing to offer everything cheerfully to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before man, however, they acted as if they had offered all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the Babylonian garment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The principle of Babylon, therefore, is hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no reality, yet people act as if there is in order to obtain glory from man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is a real danger to God's children pretending to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a great deal of spiritual behavior which is acted out in falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is put on as a veneer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many long prayers are counterfeit; many prayerful tones are unreal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no reality, but it is made to appear as if there is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever we put on a garment which does not match our actual condition, we are in the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's children do not know how much falsehood they have put on in order to receive glory from man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is entirely opposite from the attitude of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything done in falsehood is done in the principle of the harlot, not in the principle of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a great matter for God's children to be delivered from pretending before man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The principle of Babylon is to pretend in order to receive glory from man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we set our sight upon man's glory and man's position in the church, we are participating in the sin of the Babylonian garment and the sin committed by Ananias and Sapphira.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>False consecration is sin, and false spirituality is also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>True worship is in spirit and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May God make us true men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another condition of Babylon is seen in Revelation 18:7: "For she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and I am not a widow."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She sits as a queen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She has lost all of her character of being a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She has no feeling about the Lord Jesus being killed and crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, she says, "I sit a queen."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She has lost her faithfulness; she has missed her proper goal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the principle of Babylon, and this is corrupted Christianity.</S>
