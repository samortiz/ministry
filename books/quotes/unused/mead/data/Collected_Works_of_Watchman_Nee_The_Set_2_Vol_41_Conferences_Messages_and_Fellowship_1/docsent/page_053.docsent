   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INDWELLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Holy Spirit dwells within man to be his life, and He rests upon man to be his power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are not clear about the difference between these two aspects of His work, we do not know the difference between the work of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament and that in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit was promised by Christ in the New Testament before His death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This aspect of the Spirit's work is related to the Lord's death, and it was fulfilled at the time of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit's indwelling in man is for the purpose of becoming life to the believers and also for the purpose of producing the fruit of the Spirit in the believer's living, such as holiness, righteousness, endurance, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The outpouring of the Spirit upon man was promised by the Father in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This promise was confirmed by the Lord before His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This aspect of the Spirit's work is related to the Lord's ascension, and it was fulfilled after the Lord ascended and was exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit's outpouring upon man is for the purpose of clothing the believers with the Lord's power for their testimony and also for the purpose of producing the gifts of the Spirit and empowering the believers to work for the Lord for the accomplishment of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we read the Old and the New Testaments, we must differentiate between the Spirit's work within man and His work outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do this, we will find that there is no conflict in the Bible about the aspects of the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not do this, we will find many contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, the Bible says that every regenerated person has the Holy Spirit abiding in him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It also says that believers may receive the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One indicates the fact of having, and the other indicates a possibility of having.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once a man believes in the Lord, the Holy Spirit will surely dwell within him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the same time, he can also experience the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we make a clear distinction between these matters, we will see wonderful things happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let me mention one example.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day the Samaritans believed in the Lord and were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible does not say that they received the indwelling as well as the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead Acts 8 records that although they were baptized, they had not yet received the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit had not yet come upon any of them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not understand the difference between the indwelling and the outpouring of the Spirit, we will find it hard to explain the fact that the Samaritans had believed and were baptized, but had not yet received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will not know how to explain Romans 8, 1 John 4, and 1 Corinthians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these passages speak of the Holy Spirit dwelling within man as soon as he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In actuality, the Samaritans were not lacking the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were only lacking the Spirit outpoured upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE INWARD AND OUTWARD ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>OF THE SPIRIT IN AND UPON MAN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The inward work of the Holy Spirit within man is for life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It enables man to bear the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The outward work of the Holy Spirit outside of man is for testimony and work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It brings man spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a man is filled with the Spirit within and also has the Spirit upon him, he will be empowered for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a man is not filled within, but only clothed without, he will not receive much benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In fact, it will damage him because he will become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a man has not passed through the gate of victory, he may have the experience of the outpouring of the Spirit, but in a few months or a few years at most, others will see that he is short of something.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must experience both aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit in and upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE HOLY SPIRIT TESTIFYING FOR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Holy Spirit does not testify of Himself; He testifies of Christ John 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After a person sees the redemption of the cross, others may teach him to go on to pray for the Spirit and to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Speaking of the Spirit in this way is for the purpose of leading him to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In speaking about the work of the Holy Spirit in man, we do not mention the Holy Spirit in an isolated way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we mention the Spirit in reference to how He testifies for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>During the past few days we have been speaking on the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We did not mention the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, we mentioned how the Lord has resurrected and has become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The work of the Holy Spirit is directly related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When a man sees the work of Christ, he receives the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a man sees the death of Christ, he receives the regeneration of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When a man sees the resurrection of Christ, he receives the Spirit as life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a man sees the ascended Christ, the Lord who is sitting on the throne, he receives the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The outpouring of the Spirit is for testifying Christ, and the indwelling of the Spirit is for testifying Christ as well.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, the Holy Spirit within enables us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the other hand, this Spirit within testifies that the Lord is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the Holy Spirit is in us, we bear the fruit of the Spirit Gal 5:22-23 , which fruit is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God has not given us separate fruits of the Spirit with one called love, another called joy, and a third called endurance, etc. God has given us the complete Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The fruit mentioned in Galatians 5:22 is singular in the original language; there is only one fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is like a tangerine, which has nine sections, but the nine sections still make one fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we have the fruit of the Spirit, we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is impossible for us to have love but not joy, or to have joy but not endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is in the wholesale business; He is not in the retail business.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He only gives us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we have love but do not have joy, it means that we have only our own fruit, not the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are three chapters in the Bible that specifically speak of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are 1 Corinthians 12 through 14.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Chapters twelve and fourteen are on the outpouring of the Spirit; they are related to the outward aspects of the Spirit's work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Chapter thirteen is on love; it is related to the inward aspects of the Spirit's work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we replace the phrase the fruit of the Spirit with the word love, we will see that 1 Corinthians 13 is actually speaking of the things of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The first item of the fruit of the Spirit is love.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Without love other items, such as joy, peace, and endurance, are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Paul pursued love because once he had love, he had everything.</S>
