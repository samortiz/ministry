Held by the Hand of Jehovah</H2><P>Christ was not only called but also held by the hand of Jehovah (Isa. 42:6b). There may be a distance between a called one and the calling one, but God held Christ by Christ's hand. The Holder is Jehovah, and the held One is Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Upheld (Sustained) by Jehovah</H2><P>He was also upheld (sustained) by Jehovah (42:1a). We need to consider the difference between the words hold and uphold. When someone is standing, we may hold him, but when he is falling we need to uphold him. To uphold is to sustain someone, not letting him fall, but keeping him standing. This is what God was doing related to Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Helped by Jehovah</H2><P>Christ was also helped by Jehovah (49:8b). Helped may be a small word in our understanding, but actually Jehovah's helping Jesus was His doing everything for Jesus. God did everything for Jesus. Jesus could not raise the dead by Himself apart from God. God did it for Him and through Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Kept (Preserved) by Jehovah</H2><P>He was kept (preserved) by Jehovah (42:6c; 49:8c). To keep is to preserve.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. In Him Jehovah Delighting</H2><P>In Him Jehovah delights (Isa. 42:1; Matt. 3:17). God delighted in Christ Jesus as the Servant of God. In Him God is happy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Upon Him Jehovah Having Put His Spirit</H2><P>Upon Him Jehovah has put His Spirit (Isa. 42:1; Luke 4:18). Actually Jehovah's Spirit is Jehovah. When Jehovah put His Spirit upon Jesus, that meant He gave Himself to Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Glorified (Honored) in the Sight of Jehovah</H2><P>He was glorified (honored) in the sight of Jehovah (Isa. 49:5c). Although He was despised by people, abhorred by the nation of Israel, and subjected to tyrants, He was respected by kings and worshipped by princes (49:7). Christ was glorified, honored, in the sight of Jehovah. Tyrants here, no doubt, refers to the Roman officials. Pilate and Herod were the tyrants who mistreated Jesus, and Jesus was subjected to them. The Gospels tell us that Pilate had Jesus beaten and delivered Him up to be crucified (Matt. 27:26). That was a severe mistreating. Even though He was mistreated by and subjected to tyrants, He was still respected by kings and worshipped by princes. After His resurrection until today, many kings have respected Him, and many princes have worshipped Him. He was not only glorified, honored, by God but also respected by human kings and worshipped by human princes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Strengthened by God</H2><P>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ was also strengthened by His God (Isa. 49:5c). God was His strength.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_225.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_227.html">Next</a> </body></html>
