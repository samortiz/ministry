   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE PRODUCING AND BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE ASCENSION AND INDWELLING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:19-23; 4:7-8, 11-16; 2 Cor 13:5; Gal 1:16a; 2:20; 4:19; 2 Tim 4:22a; 2 Cor 3:17-18</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s purpose is to have the church, and Christ s death, resurrection, ascension, and indwelling are all for the producing and building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous chapter we saw that the death of Christ dealt with all the negative matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the cross Christ took away our sins, and He dealt with Satan, even destroying him John 1:29; Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ also judged the evil world, and He crucified our old man, our natural life, and our flesh John 12:31; Rom 6:6; Matt 16:24-25; Gal 6:14; 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, on the cross Christ abolished all the ordinances, the different manners of life, in order to create one new man of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles Eph 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in His resurrection Christ multiplied Himself as the one grain into many grains, which are His many brothers, the many sons of God John 12:24; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before the death of Christ, God had only one unique Son, the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, through His death and resurrection, Christ became the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the firstborn Son, He has many brothers, who are the many sons of God, the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the Body of Christ is constituted with the many sons of God, the genuine church life is simply the totality of the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The divine sonship is the church life, because every member of the church is a child of God, born anew with God s divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is composed of the divine life and nature, which has been dispensed into all of us who are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All this was accomplished through Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the negative things are gone, and now we are the sons of God with God s divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have the divine sonship to be the church, the living Body of Christ Eph 1:5, 22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this chapter we will see how the church is built up by the ascension of Christ and by His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is not only the crucified, resurrected, and living Christ; He is also the exalted, ascended, and indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is exalted in the third heaven, and He is now indwelling His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what Christ is for the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CHRIST S ASCENSION BEING IN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SURPASSING GREATNESS OF GOD S POWER</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ s death and resurrection are the first two steps He took to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Following this, He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not many Christians have a thorough realization of what Christ s ascension accomplished for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 1:19-23 reveals that the ascension and exaltation of Christ have very much to do with His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These verses say, What is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ today is in the heavens, where He is exalted far above all Phil 2:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Landing men on the moon requires much power to overcome gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the moon is only one-quarter of a million miles from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one can measure the distance from the earth to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For Christ to ascend to the third heaven required surpassingly great power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, as Christ was ascending from the Mount of Olives, the evil powers must have been fighting against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, Christ simply ascended in the sight of all the disciples Acts 1:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This must have shocked the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ephesians 1:21 says that Christ ascended far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the universe, including not only the angelic, heavenly authorities but also the human, earthly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that in His ascension Christ overcame not only gravity and the demons on the earth but also the layer of fallen angels in the air to ascend all the way to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now Christ is there in the third heaven, and the earth, the demons, and all the principalities and powers in the air are under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN HIS ASCENSION CHRIST BEING</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>HEAD OVER ALL THINGS TO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The surpassing power that God caused to operate in Christ also made Him Head over all things not merely for the church but to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever Christ has obtained, attained, done, and will do are to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may illustrate the meaning of to the church by considering electric lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order for lamps to shine, whatever electricity is, has, and can do must come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, the electric current is not only for the lamps but also to the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are the lamps, and the exalted Christ is the heavenly electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has come out of death, ascended to the heavens, and been exalted far above all, and He has also been made Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A person s head is not only for his body but to his body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that whatever the head is, has, and can do are transmitted to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever Christ is, whatever He has, and whatever He can do are transmitted into the church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The true position of the church is not on the earth but in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the one hand, our electric lamps are in our home, but according to the electricity within them, they are also in the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The electricity connects the lamps to the power plant and the power plant to the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to our human feeling, we are surely on the earth, but the heavenly Christ connects us to the third heaven and the third heaven to us John 1:51; Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need a proper vision.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our problem is that we often have a narrow view and say, The world is corrupt, the age is dark, and everything is disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My home, school, work, and everyone around me are all no good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I want to be victorious, but I cannot make it, and the more I try to be holy, the more I become defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, we all need to see the vision that Christ our Head has lifted us off the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many years ago flying in an airplane was difficult, but today a large jet is safe and comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The exalted Christ is our best jet.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must not look at ourselves or at the poor situation around us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are not in our situation; we are in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the insects, snakes, and scorpions on the earth create a poor environment, but we are sitting in the third heaven looking down at them all.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need a vision to see that Christ not only was crucified and resurrected, but He also ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now He is in the third heaven as the Head over all things, and we are in the heavens in Him.</S>
