Our spirit was only an organ. When we received the Lord Jesus, He came into our spirit to be our life. In our spirit we have another life, the divine life. The Greek word which the New Testament uses for this life is zoe. Zoe is in our spirit.<p>Bios is the physical life in our body. Psuche is the human life in the soul. Zoe referring to the divine life is in our spirit. This divine life is simply God Himself. This divine life is simply Christ Himself, God Himself, coming into our spirit to be our life. Now we have three kinds of lives. In our spirit we have zoe, in our soul we have psuche, and in our body we have bios. We have a biological life, a soulish life, and the divine life. This divine life, zoe, is simply the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE BIRTH OF OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Our spirit has been born by God coming into our spirit as life. &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit,&#8221; (John 3:6b). Now the divine life is in our spirit. Our spirit was born because God&#8217;s life got into it, and this birth has nothing to do with our fall. Even if Adam had never fallen, he still would have needed to be born in this way. He still needed to have God come into him as life. Otherwise, he couldn&#8217;t express God. We need to be born again by having the life of God get into us. This life gets into our spirit and our spirit is born. Now in our spirit there is life, and this life is just God Himself.<h2 class=head1>LIVE THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>Since we have three lives, by what life should we live? By the biological life? By the soulish life? Or by the divine life? We are used to living by the soulish life, but now we need to live by the divine life in our spirit. If we don&#8217;t know our spirit, we can&#8217;t live by the divine life. We all need to know our spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD WITH YOUR SPIRIT</h2><p>This divine life has been installed into our spirit. If we need to turn on the lights, we go to the switch. What we need today is to touch the &#8220;switch&#8221; of our spirit because the divine life is in our spirit. Nothing could be more clear or definite than 2 Timothy 4:22: &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit.&#8221; We don&#8217;t have to go to other places. We need to come to our spirit. We are used to going other places. Even when we come to the church meeting and the brothers say, &#8220;Hallelujah! Amen!&#8221; sometimes we would not go to the spirit. We still would keep ourselves in the mind. We may even question: &#8220;Do the brothers need to be so loud and noisy?&#8221; This is a strong proof that we are used to being outside of the spirit. We are used to being in the mind, but we must turn ourselves to the spirit. Forget about how loud and noisy the brothers are. You have to exercise your spirit. When you get into your spirit, you may be louder. The problem is that we Christians would not turn to the very spot where God is. Where is God today? &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit.&#8221;<p>In Matthew 28:20 there is a great promise given to us. The Lord Jesus promises to be with us until the end, the completion of this age. This is one of the great promises in the Bible. He is with us to the end of this age. Where is He with us? He is with our spirit.<p>Everything we need is in our spirit. The divine life in our spirit is inexhaustible and immeasurable. We have the divine life within us, which is just God Himself in our spirit. This is God Himself after incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Today this very God comes into us to be with us in our spirit with the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ.<h2 class=head1>TURN TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>We need to turn to the spirit. We need to be strong in the spirit. We need to act and walk in the spirit because it is here that we have God, Christ, and the divine life. The soul-life and the biological life are secondary. We have the divine life which is God Himself. This is not God before incarnation, but God after ascension. The very God with His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension is within us as our life. All the day we should turn ourselves to this dear One by calling on His name (Rom. 10:12-13). You will see the riches, you will see the sweetness, and you will see the refreshment. You will see the power, even the authority.<h2 class=head1>THE STRATEGIC POINT</h2><p>The human spirit is the strategic point for the inner life. We all have to know our human spirit. It is here that we have been born again and it is here that we worship God. &#8220;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit&#8221; (John 4:24), not in the Holy Spirit, but in our human spirit. In our reborn human spirit we worship God, we serve God, we fellowship with one another, and we grow in life. We even have the church life here. If you are not in the spirit, you cannot have the church life. The church life is a life absolutely in the human spirit. When we turn to the spirit, you are one with me, and I am one with you. Regardless of how much we talk about the church life, we are still not in it unless we turn to our spirit. When we turn to our human spirit, we are in the church life, and we are one.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
