God speaks not through the stones that are shining, but through stones that become dark. This means that God speaks through negative situations. Normally the twelve stones in the breastplate were under the shining of the Urim. Suddenly a piece inscribed with a certain name would become dark. This darkening of a particular stone was God&rsquo;s instant speaking. Our natural concept would be that God&rsquo;s speaking through the breastplate came from the stones that were shining. Actually, He spoke through the stones that suddenly became dark.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s Epistles and also the seven epistles of the Lord Jesus to the seven churches in Asia were all written according to this principle. They were written according to the negative situation of the churches, not according to the positive things found in the churches. Take, for example, Paul&rsquo;s First Epistle to the Corinthians. If there were no negative things found in the church in Corinth, I doubt that 1 Corinthians would have been written. Paul wrote this Epistle according to his reading of the negative situation at Corinth. By considering that situation, he knew what to write. But although his writing was based on the negative things, in this Epistle he ministered positive things&mdash;the riches of Christ&mdash;to the church.</p><p>The problem among Christians today is that because there is so much darkness, there is no way for God to expose darkness. When everything is in darkness, it is difficult to point out a particular matter that is in darkness. Suppose in a room there are many rows of lights on the ceiling. If all the lights are shining, it will be easy to find one that becomes dark. This illustrates how God spoke through the breastplate. The darkening of a particular stone was God&rsquo;s instant speaking.</p><p>The situation of Christians today is abnormal. Instead of light, there is darkness. As a result, God has hardly any way to speak. In order for the darkness to be made known, there must first be the shining of light. If there is no light in a room, there is no way for darkness to be shown. But when all the lights are shining, it immediately becomes apparent when a certain light becomes dark. That darkness is an indicator that something is wrong. If in a certain church things that are wrong are easily found out, that church is normal. But if in a particular church it is not possible to find out what is wrong, this is an indication that the church there is in darkness. When darkness prevails, it is not possible for negative matters to be exposed. For this, light is necessary. What is exposed under the shining of the light is God&rsquo;s speaking. God speaks through things becoming negative. This kind of negative situation is an indicator of the shortage of Christ. By reading the negative situations in this way, we come to know God&rsquo;s leading. Then in our locality we shall know what God wants us to do, and we should then follow His leading.</p><h2 class="head1">JUDGMENT AND SUPPLY</h2><p>The leading obtained through the breastplate always involves a judgment. This means that the Lord&rsquo;s speaking through the breastplate is through negative situations. If this speaking were only through positive situations, there would be no need of judgment, for everything would be positive and justified. But because the Lord&rsquo;s speaking is through negative situations, that speaking is a judgment.</p><p>The Apostle Paul was one who was truly shining. Under the shining of Paul, the darkness was exposed. Paul wrote certain of his Epistles according to the darkness, according to the negative condition, of the saints in the churches. Because Paul saw certain dark areas in the church in Corinth, areas that were letters of God&rsquo;s judgment, Paul could write Corinthians as a book of judgment. But along with all the judgment contained in this Epistle, there are many positive things: the riches of Christ ministered to the believers at Corinth. This is God&rsquo;s way of speaking. Both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, God&rsquo;s speaking is according to the negative situation, yet with the riches of Christ as the supply for His people.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_422.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_424.html">Next</a> </body></html>
