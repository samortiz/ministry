   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It was to this one, later to be called Paul, that the Spirit of truth eventually disclosed many mysterious things.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul said that he received an assignment, a charge, and a burden from God to complete the word of God, the divine revelation Col 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It would be a great loss if Paul's fourteen Epistles were taken away from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without his Epistles, we would not be able to fellowship anything concerning the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus did not have the opportunity to reveal this in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Matthew 16 tells us that one day Jesus asked His disciples, "Who do you say that I am?" v. 15 . Peter responded, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . No doubt, Peter received a heavenly revelation of who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord went on to say that He would build His church upon this rock, upon this revelation concerning Christ which Peter received.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This revelation of Christ and the church in Matthew 16 is wonderful, but it is not as intrinsic as the revelation of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord did not tell Peter that the church was His Body because He knew that Peter would not be able to apprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though Peter became the top apostle in Jerusalem, he did not receive such a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not until later that Paul received this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Paul's fourteen Epistles, we can see all the mysterious things, all the hidden things, of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This economy was a mystery hidden in God who created the universe Eph 3:9 , but it was revealed to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we read Paul's writings, we cannot help but wonder where and how he saw so many mysterious things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We would not be able to understand all the typology in Leviticus without his writing in the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, the Body of Christ is only mentioned in the writings of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more I have studied Paul's Epistles, the more I have wondered what kind of person he was and how he received his revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How could Paul see all these things?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who told Paul of the one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father with one hope, one faith, and one baptism Eph 4:4-6 ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul saw that in eternity past before the foundation of the world, God selected us in Christ that we might be made holy Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who told this to Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Ephesians 1 Paul told us that Christ accomplished redemption with the forgiveness of sins, and this redemption brought all of God's chosen people into Christ as a realm, a sphere, and an element.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With this element we saved ones will be made God's inheritance, and eventually the entire universe will be headed up in Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who told Paul this?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need revelation to see all the wonderful things revealed to Paul concerning the Body of Christ in the book of Ephesians.</S>
