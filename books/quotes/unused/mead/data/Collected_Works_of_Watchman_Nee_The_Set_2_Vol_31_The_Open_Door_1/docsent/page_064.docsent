   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sister X:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our ship left Hong Kong at 4:30 p.m. on the seventh and arrived at Haiphong at 7:00 on the tenth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Tseng, who works at Haiphong, helped us to go on and accompanied us to Ho-Nei a three-hour train ride from Haiphong .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We took a train to Ho-Kou on the morning of the thirteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Chen Ho-seng met us at the station and took care of everything for us including acting as a guarantor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the fourteenth we took another train to Ah-Mei-Jou.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the way we preached the gospel to a clerk with the Communication Broadcast Company and to an official with the railway.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God cared for us through them all the way to our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We arrived safely in K'un-ming at 5:00 p.m. on the fifteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some brothers and sisters were waiting for us at the station.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are now living temporarily in Brother Huang's house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Along the way we saw beautiful scenery with both mountains and streams.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We passed through one hundred eighty tunnels on the three day railroad journey and crossed more than ten iron bridges over mountain valleys between Ho-Kou and K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We fully enjoyed the beauty of nature and thought of the words of Psalm 19.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We really felt happy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mountains, streams, flowers, and trees all express God's glory in His creation and His wondrous works.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peace to you all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Greet the sisters.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>February 16</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Four</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To Brother X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ever-living God is constantly planning for His children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In my travels from Ch'ang-sha, the weather was mainly clear and sunny.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the bus I took left, nobody was going to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The bus should have gone to Ch'ang-Teh to stay the night, but it went on to Yuan-Ling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we arrived, I found that a Mr. Chao was going to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He had left one day before I did on the seventh and should have been ahead of me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God provided for me, and he was waiting for me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He assisted me the entire way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We arrived in Kuei-yang on the twelfth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the thirteenth I happened to be reading the Bible in the hotel according to my habit of reading consecutively through the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was really marvelous how the Word of God gave me great comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Exodus 23:20 says, "Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I held on to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the fourteenth, I boarded the bus at dawn.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The road from this point on was a little different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes there were no porters when we stopped for the night.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the seventeenth we ran out of gas deep in the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was already 5:00 p.m., and we were twenty miles from the city.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the men ran into the city, but I and a few other women travelers could only wait.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When it was almost dark, the people who passed by on the road exhorted us to go into the city because bandits sometimes would appear in that area.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The gas had not arrived at 7:15, and everyone was getting frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I could only pray.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God placed His precious Word before my eyes again in Psalm 27:1, "Jehovah is my light and my salvation;/Whom shall I fear?/Jehovah is the strength of my life;/Whom shall I be dread?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I held on to God's word tightly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seemed that the gas came at around 8:00 p.m., and we arrived in Pan-Shian safely.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We left Pan-Shian a little after 9:00 a.m. on the eighteenth and arrived in K'un-ming at about 3:00 p.m. We were inspected countless times along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some travelers were questioned at almost every station, but I was only questioned twice, once at An-Shun and once when we arrived in K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I can say that God's special care was with me the whole way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The weather was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although it rained for two days, it rained while I was in the bus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the bus stopped, it never rained on me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oh, I really must thank and praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am now living with a friend named Hsu.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A weak one in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Chu Teh-hwa</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>February 21</S>
