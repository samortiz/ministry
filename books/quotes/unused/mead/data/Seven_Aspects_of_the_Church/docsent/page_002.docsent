   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STANDING AGAINST DEGRADATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today's Christianity is filled with religion, doctrine, organization, forms, rituals, and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>People are helped to be saved, to become religious, to pursue spirituality, and to desire a closer walk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But where is the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that so many Christians do not see that in the book of Ephesians the church is emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his subtlety the enemy, Satan, has used various good things such as fundamental doctrine to damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must stand against the degradation of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In doing this, we do not fight against people, but against the Devil, the subtle one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because the Lord is sovereign, He cannot be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even today He is fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Lord's recovery we are not for religion, knowledge, organization, rituals, forms, or regulations; we are only for the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we enjoy the mingled spirit in a corporate way, we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>SEVEN ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The book of Ephesians reveals various aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this booklet we shall consider seven of these aspects: the Body, the new man, the Bride, the family, the kingdom, the dwelling place of God, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to 1:22 and 23, the church is Christ's Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was in this one Body that both the Jews and the Gentiles were reconciled to God through the cross 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We, the believers, were reconciled not only for the Body of Christ, but also in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all have been reconciled in the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we have seen, the gifted persons are for the building up of the Body, and the Body is growing unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Expressing Christ as Life</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the Body, the church needs life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without life, our physical body would become a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same is true of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some argue that the Body is just a symbol, a figure, not a divine reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is utterly wrong to say that the Body of Christ is merely a symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our body is a symbol and a figure, but the Body of Christ is a reality, for our body symbolizes Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To say that the Body of Christ is merely a symbol indicates a lack of a proper understanding of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who hold this view do not see that the church is actually the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Surely Christ is real.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can such a real One be expressed through a symbolic Body?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How ridiculous!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order for Christ to be expressed, He must have a real and living Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not express Christ by endeavoring to correct or improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through such efforts we can express only our own character.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would express Christ, we need the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need Christ as the living Spirit to live Himself out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not outward correction or improvement; it is the experience of Christ as our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit living within us and lived out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This makes us His Body for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What we express as the Body of Christ is not our character, but Christ Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 2:15 we see that Christ created the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This new man is corporate and universal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are many believers, but there is only one new man in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the believers are components of this corporate and universal new man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to 4:13, we are to grow up until we arrive at a full-grown man, and in 4:24 we see that, in a practical way, we need to put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Taking Christ as Our Person</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the new man, the church needs not only life, but also Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A tree has only life, not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But a man must have a person as well as life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church not only possesses Christ as life, but also holds Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, today the Lord Jesus is not only the life of the church, but also the person of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to have the church life, we all must take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if we each hold to our own person, we shall be through with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Colossians 3:10 and 11 reveal that in the new man "there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that in the new man there is just one person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no room for Chinese, Japanese, American, British, German, or any other nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This should not be a mere doctrine, but should be our practical experience in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a part of the new man, we all have Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to pray, "Lord, make this real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot be satisfied with knowledge or with the doctrine that the church is the new man with Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We want to experience this in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>O Lord, help us to take You as our person."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do this, the church will be truly one, and the enemy will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whoever comes into the meetings of the church will see a number of people who take Christ as their person.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How marvelous!</S>
