   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ORGANIC UNION WITH THE PROCESSED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After His resurrection, Christ charged His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 , that is, to bring the believing ones into the Triune God, into an organic union with the processed God, who has passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and has entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is based upon such an organic union that at the conclusion of his second Epistle to the Corinthians the apostle blesses the believers with the blessed Trinity in the participation of the Son s grace with the Father s love through the Spirit s fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this Trinity, God the Father operates all things in all the members in the church, which is the Body of Christ, through the ministries of the Lord, God the Son, by the gifts of God the Spirit 1 Cor 12:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE TRIUNE GOD PRODUCING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The entire divine revelation in the book of Ephesians concerning the producing, existing, growing, building up, and fighting of the church as the Body of Christ is composed of this divine economy, the dispensing of the Triune God into the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter one unveils how God the Father chose and predestinated these members in eternity vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4-5 , God the Son redeemed them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>6-12 , and God the Spirit sealed them as a pledge vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>13-14 , thus imparting Himself into His believers for the formation of the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapter two shows us that in the divine Trinity all the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, have access unto God the Father, through God the Son, in God the Spirit v. 18 . This also indicates that the Three coexist and coinhere simultaneously, even after all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter three the apostle prays that God the Father would grant the believers to be strengthened through God the Spirit in their inner man, that Christ, God the Son, may make His home in their heart, that is, may occupy their entire being, that they might be filled unto all the fullness of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the climax of God in His Trinity to be experienced and participated in by the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter four portrays how the processed God as the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father is mingled with the Body of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4-6 for the experience of the divine Trinity by all its members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chapter five exhorts the believers to praise the Lord, God the Son, with the songs of God the Spirit, and give thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, God the Son, to God the Father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is to praise and thank the processed God in His divine trinity for our enjoyment of Him as the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapter six instructs us to fight the spiritual warfare by being empowered in the Lord, God the Son, putting on the whole armor of God the Father, and wielding the sword of God the Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>10, 11, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God by the believers even in the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FOR OUR ENJOYMENT AND PARTICIPATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Apostle Peter, in his writings, confirms this trinity of God for the believers enjoyment by referring them to the election of God the Father, the sanctification of God the Spirit, and the redemption of Jesus Christ, God the Son, by His blood 1 Pet 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And John the Apostle also strengthens the revelation of the divine Trinity for the believers participation in the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the book of Revelation he blesses the churches in different localities with grace and peace from God the Father, Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from God the Spirit, the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from God the Son, Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This blessing of John to the churches also indicates that the processed Triune God in all He is as the eternal Father, in all He is able to do as the sevenfold intensified Spirit, and in all He has attained and obtained as the anointed Son is for the believers enjoyment, that they may be His corporate testimony as the golden lampstands 1:9, 11, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, it is evident that the divine revelation of the trinity of the Godhead in the Holy Word, from Genesis through Revelation, is not for the study of theology, but for the apprehension of how God in His mysterious and marvelous trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people, that we as His chosen and redeemed people may, as indicated in the apostle s blessing to the Corinthian believers, participate in, experience, enjoy, and possess the processed Triune God now and for eternity.</S>
