   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord s Sovereign Preservation of Paul</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In his ministry Paul was constantly fighting against the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have pointed out, the power of darkness was behind the idol worship in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Humanly speaking, there was no reason for the people in Ephesus to behave so foolishly, crying out without knowing what they were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their behavior was provoked by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The demons in the idol worshippers instigated them to do something against God s propagating ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was of the Lord s sovereignty that this disturbance took place at the end of Paul s three-year stay in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As 20:1 tells us, after the uproar had ceased, Paul, having sent for the disciples and encouraged them, took leave of them and went off to go into Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THROUGH MACEDONIA AND GREECE TO TROAS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 20:1-3 we can see more clearly the kind of situation Paul was in. Verse 1 says that he took leave of the disciples and went off to go into Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was here that Paul wrote his second Epistle to the church in Corinth 2 Cor 2:13; 7:5-6; 8:1; 9:2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul s first Epistle to the church in Corinth 1 Cor 16:3-10, 19 was written from Ephesus at the time of 19:22.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have also seen that at the time of 18:5 Paul wrote his first Epistle to the Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is likely that his second Epistle to the Thessalonians was written not long afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, during this period of time Paul may have written the Epistle to the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Acts 20:2 and 3, after Paul passed through Macedonia, he came into Greece and spent three months there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was at this time in Corinth that the apostle wrote his Epistle to the saints in Rome Rom 15:22-32; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 19:21; 1 Cor 16:3-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A Fourfold Burden</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In reading chapters eighteen through twenty of Acts we see that Paul had at least a fourfold burden: a burden for the church in Corinth, a burden for the church in Ephesus, an even stronger burden for the situation in Jerusalem, and also a burden for the church in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a foregoing message we emphasized the fact that Paul s heart was toward Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem and then to see Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of his burden Paul wrote the two Epistles to the Corinthians and the Epistle to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although he was heavily burdened with the work in the area of the Mediterranean Sea, he was also very much burdened for the situation of the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Acts 20:3 says, And having spent three months there, a plot having been made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he resolved to return through Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul originally intended to go to Jerusalem through Syria from Achaia in Greece 19:21; 1 Cor 16:3-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Due to the Jews plot against him, he changed his route northward to Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From there he returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was aware of and suffering from the plots of the Jews Acts 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of this, he begged the saints in Rome to pray for him concerning his return to Jerusalem Rom 15:25-26, 30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was possibly also the cause of his being bound in his spirit to go to Jerusalem Acts 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, after returning to Jerusalem, he was seized by the Jews 21:27-30 , who sought to kill him 21:31; 23:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul was very cautious concerning the Jews who were plotting against him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When he learned of this plot, he wisely changed his route.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By this we can see the difficult situation in which Paul found himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although he was in such a situation, he still had the burden to care for the Lord s interest universally, not only in Corinth and Macedonia, but also in Jerusalem and Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very important for us to see Paul s fourfold burden for Corinth, Ephesus, Jerusalem, and Rome.</S>
