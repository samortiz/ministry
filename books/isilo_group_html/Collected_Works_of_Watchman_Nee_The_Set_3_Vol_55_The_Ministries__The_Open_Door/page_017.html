We have waited on the Lord time and again and have made some decisions. We will put out four kinds of publications beginning in July of this year: 1) The Ministers, 2) The Gospel, 3) The Way, and 4) The Testimony. We have temporarily decided to make them all bimonthly publications. Thank the Lord, the first issue of The Ministers has been published. We hope the other three publications will be ready on schedule. This burden, however, is very heavy. It requires that each reader pray much for us.</p><p>Editor</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE MINISTERS</h2><p>NATURE: To show the way to serve, to help the serving ones and the churches in the different localities go on, and to solve the problems related to the ministry.</p><p>TIME OF PUBLICATION: Temporarily set at bimonthly.</p><p>PRICE: A) We want to give this publication out free of charge, but because we must register with the government and the post office and to prevent those who do not need it from reading it carelessly, we are forced to temporarily set the following price: 60,000 yuan per issue for the first three issues. (International postage is an additional cost. Airmail is an additional cost.) B) We will consider giving the publication to those who really need it but cannot afford it. C) We will receive gladly from those who are able to make a donation to help with the cost of publication.</p><p>SUBSCRIPTION: Whoever would like to subscribe to this publication should fill out one of the cards provided and mail it to the Shipping Department, Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 5008, Shanghai. (In every place with a local church, please contact the local church there.)</p><ol class="bullet"><li><a class="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/table1.pdf">Table of the Condition of Brothers Migrating from Cheefoo to Suiyan Province</a></li><li><a class="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/table2.pdf">Table of the Condition of All the Localities in the Northwest</a></li></ol><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>Our bookroom is in the process of reorganization. For the sake of the testimony and for the convenience of management, we would ask the following of each locality and of all those who are closely related to our bookroom:</p><p>1) Please do not freely use the name "Gospel Book Room" for any of your organizations. (We dare request this because we are all one in the Lord.)</p><p>2) The Gospel Book Room takes back all of its copyrights as of this date.</p><p>3) If your locality has already printed copies of Gospel Book Room's publications, do not print any more after these are sold.</p><p>P.S. The Gospel Book Room has rented P. O. Box No. 5008 in Shanghai. Please send any letters to this address in the future.</p><p>The Shanghai Gospel Book Room<br />July 1, 1948</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
