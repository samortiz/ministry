   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN CHRIST AS THE CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD'S MOVE ON THE EARTH 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 68:1-18; Num 9:15a; 10:35; Eph 4:8, 11-12; 6:12; 2:22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will begin to study Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we come to this psalm, we should regard it as the highest psalm among the one hundred fifty psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 68 is extremely difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Examples of this difficulty are found in verses 11b through 13.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"The women who bear the glad tidings are a great host./The kings of the armies flee./They flee!/And she who abides at home / Divides the spoil./Though you lie among the sheepfolds,/There are dove wings covered with silver,/And its pinions, with greenish yellow gold."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who are the women who bear the glad tidings and are a great host?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who is she who abides at home and divides the spoil?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There seems to be no antecedent for the pronoun "she" here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To whom does this pronoun refer?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, who is the "you" lying among the sheepfolds?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We also need to inquire concerning the dove wings covered with silver and the pinions covered with greenish yellow gold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must admit that it is difficult for us to know what these things mean and to understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we will see, the dove, the silver, and the gold refer to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The dove symbolizes the Spirit of God; in typology silver signifies Christ as the Redeemer who accomplished redemption for God's salvation; and gold signifies God in His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here the gold is greenish yellow, with green signifying the divine life and yellow, the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, greenish yellow gold signifies God in His nature glittering in His life and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we have the Triune God the Spirit, Christ, and God with all His accomplishments for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 12 speaks of dividing the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is this spoil?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is something reaped as the result of fighting a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His death, resurrection, and ascension, Christ fought the battle, and the spoil reaped by Him has become our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ gained some spoil in every step of His fighting; He reaped spoil in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension, at which time, according to Colossians 2, the evil ones tried to hold Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The spoil gained, reaped, by Christ is actually the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the spoil in verse 12 is the Spirit as the dove, Christ the Son as the silver, and God the Father as the gold.</S>
