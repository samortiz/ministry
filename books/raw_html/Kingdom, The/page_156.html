<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Swearing</H2><P>Not to swear surpasses not swearing falsely (Matt. 5:33-37). To swear falsely is to neglect to fulfill what you have promised and sworn to do. It means not to keep your oath. Therefore, the Old Testament said not to swear falsely (Lev. 19:12; Num. 30:2). This means do not neglect to do what you have said. You must do whatever you have sworn to do. But the new law of life requires you not to swear at all. There is no need to swear because there is no need to prove that you are right. If you are right, you are simply right. You have no need to prove it. If the answer is yes, simply say yes; if no, simply say no. There is no need to swear about it. To say more is of the evil one (Matt. 5:37). Not to swear at all is much higher than not swearing falsely.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Resisting an Evil Person</H2><P>The law of life which says, "Do not resist one who is evil" (Matt. 5:39), surpasses Moses' law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. According to Moses' law if someone breaks out your tooth, you in turn may break out his tooth (Exo. 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21). But the law of life says, "Do not resist" (Matt. 5:39). If someone smites your right cheek, you should turn to him also the left cheek. If someone forces you to walk with him one mile, you should go with him two miles joyfully. If someone takes away your outer garment, you should give him your inner garment. This is much higher than the Old Testament law. It is the surpassing righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Loving Your Enemy</H2><P>Loving your enemy surely surpasses loving your neighbor. The law of Moses required you to love your neighbor (Lev. 19:18), but the law of life requires you to love your enemy (Matt. 5:44). Again, this is much higher and far surpasses the law given by Moses.</P><P>Eventually this section of the Lord's discourse ends by telling us that as children of the Father we must be perfect as the Father. We can have perfection only by the Father's life. We can have a surpassing righteousness only because we have a surpassing life within us. Because we have a surpassing life with a surpassing law, we can have a surpassing righteousness. The people of the kingdom are marvelous people! Their character, their influence, and their righteousness are marvelous! This should be the life of the local churches.</P>
