 <h2 class="head2">Regenerating Christ&rsquo;s Redeemed Ones</h2>
<p>The work of the Spirit is firstly to regenerate Christ&rsquo;s redeemed ones (John 3:6b). Our regeneration was instantaneous. After hearing the gospel, we repented, prayed, and called on the Lord&rsquo;s name. While we were praying and calling, we were regenerated by the Spirit in an instant. In this sense, receiving regeneration was easy for us. But the work of the regenerating Spirit is not easy. The Spirit uses Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection and the divine life to regenerate us. Christ&rsquo;s death terminated what we were in the past and released His divine life. His life-imparting resurrection germinated the terminated ones. The death of Christ killed us and the resurrection of Christ enlivened us with the divine life. Christ&rsquo;s death, His resurrection, and the divine life are all needed for the working Spirit to regenerate us.</p>
<p>Without His death, His resurrection, and the divine life, we could not have been regenerated regardless of how much we prayed and called on the Lord. But today we can be regenerated instantly because the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the releasing and imparting of the divine life has been accomplished by Christ. The regenerating Spirit regenerates Christ&rsquo;s redeemed ones with the death, resurrection, and the divine life of Christ. When a person calls &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; he is instantly regenerated by the Holy Spirit with these elements. Regeneration is the very beginning of the organic union of the divine Trinity within us. To be regenerated is to be organically united to the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>To install electricity into a building, there is the need of a long wire to connect the power plant to the building. Many wires are then installed throughout the building to bring the electricity to all the rooms. For the electricity to be applied to the building, the switch must be turned on. The turning on of the switch brings the current of electricity into the building. Christ accomplished everything for us so that we could receive the divine electricity. He installed a long wire from the power plant in the third heavens to us. The preaching of the gospel was the practical installation of the wires within us, in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Since all the wires were installed, all that was needed was the turning on of the switch. When we called &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the switch was turned on and we were united to the divine Trinity. Our regeneration was the beginning of our organic union, our union in life, with the divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Indwelling the Regenerated Saints</h2>
<p>The regenerating Spirit then begins to indwell the regenerated saints (Rom. 8:11). After our regeneration, the regenerating Spirit stays in us, indwells us. Since the time that we called &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we began to sense that Someone is within us all the time. Sometimes this indwelling One is comforting, enlightening, and refreshing, but many times He is very troublesome to us. On the one hand, a husband receives much comfort from his wife. On the other hand, he may be troubled by her. His wife may correct and restrict him in many ways. The husband may like to be free. He may not want to be regulated, limited, or controlled by anyone or anything. In the same way, we believers may feel that we are regulated too much by the indwelling One. The indwelling One is always regulating us. The regenerating Spirit becomes the indwelling Spirit to be the regulating law of life. If He did not indwell us, He could not be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Renewing the Spirit-indwelt Saints</h2>
<p>With the indwelling Spirit, there is the renewing. He renews the Spirit-indwelt saints (Titus 3:5b; Eph. 4:23). The Spirit renews us with a new element. This new element is the Triune God Himself with all that He has passed through, accomplished, obtained, and attained.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sanctifying the Renewed Saints</h2>
<p>The Spirit then continues to sanctify the renewed saints (Rom. 15:16b). The New Testament reveals that sanctification is not only to separate us unto God but also to change our nature with the holy nature of God. Holiness is God&rsquo;s nature. God&rsquo;s holy nature must be worked into our nature to sanctify us. When God&rsquo;s holy nature is worked into our nature, this holy nature will change our human nature. This is dispositional sanctification. God&rsquo;s sanctifying us positionally does not require Him to work His holy nature into us. But for the dispositional, subjective sanctification, there is the need for the divine, holy nature to be wrought into our being, thus changing our nature into God&rsquo;s nature. The Spirit uses the elements of all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained to sanctify us.</p>
