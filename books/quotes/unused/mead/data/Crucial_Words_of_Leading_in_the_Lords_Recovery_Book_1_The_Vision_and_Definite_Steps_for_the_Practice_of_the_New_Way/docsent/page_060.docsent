   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING MUCH AND ADEQUATE PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The co-workers and elders must also strengthen their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to consider this matter as a burden and pray for it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to be a hungry one, one must first be a fasting one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The co-workers, elders, and full-timers need to fast and pray often.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not too much to fast and pray weekly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must pray by fasting, saying, Lord, You must turn the church around absolutely from the old way of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You must turn us to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Burn in every home!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Stir up every home!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To merely act a little after I speak is not the way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to pick up the burden in a genuine way and pray with this burden pressing heavily upon our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fasting is the result of heaviness of burden and pressure in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When one becomes so pressed that he is unable to eat, he is fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we pray according to the burden within, the Lord s Spirit will come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord s Spirit comes upon us, something will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is different from a mere change of method.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although we speak of changing the system, we are merely borrowing this expression for convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In reality, if we have only an outward way without a burden that burns within us, and if we do not fast or pray, this change of the system will be an empty shell.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It will never bring forth any results.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have no way to describe the heaviness of my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope we all will see this and pick up this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The need in the Lord s recovery is great, and there is no way for us to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have mentioned before that throughout my life of serving the Lord over the past fifty or sixty years in both the East and the West, I have never seen a place like Taiwan today where needs abound.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way the high-rise apartment buildings are constructed today is simply a preparation for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Within one building there are sixty to seventy homes, and they all share a common entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is easy for everyone to know everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are we not touched by the situation?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our need today is people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At present, there are approximately ten thousand saints in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Among them only four thousand are active members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not work on the homes, and if we do not stir up every home, how can we answer to the Lord, and how can we answer to all the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PRACTICING THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>AND TRAINING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have heard that many denominations are now turning their attention to these urban communities and have gained many people from them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, they are still carrying on their practice in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I hope that when we go to these communities, we will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should practice universal conscription ; everyone should be a soldier, and every home should rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we stir up the homes with the homes, and if we perfect the homes with the homes, soon twenty homes will be stirred up in a community.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps in two years many home meetings will be established in that community.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This requires our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To depend solely on the one or two hundred co-workers and elders that we have here can be compared to attempting to quench one s thirst with only a drop of water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What we need to do is stir up the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, we cannot wait until all the homes are stirred up before we begin our work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, we need to make personal visits to the communities, and on the other hand, we need to train the saints through the practice of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we cannot break through in the matter of the home meetings, we will not be able to have an army.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every home that is stirred up becomes a part of the army.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During the Second World War, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the United States could not enlist the adequate number of fighting men by the standard way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The government opened up the opportunity for anyone interested to join the army.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result, the number of volunteers more than met the demand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The American government also diverted its resources and turned many factories into arsenals.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way all the needs were met.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today in Taiwan we need to evangelize the entire island.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord has provided us with an open door.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have three to five thousand people responding to this need, we will gospelize Taiwan in at least two years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have heard reports of the visitation work in the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These reports are very encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are well received and many people are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although we do not have the adequate manpower, we should still endeavor to do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In particular, the full-time trainees should go out at least twice a week.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have made the decision that when we go out again, we will match two young full-timers with one older saint.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I believe that there will be more open doors because of this, and people will take our gospel even more seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The training center in Taipei needs to plan, and the co-workers and elders must take the lead to encourage the working saints and the elderly saints to dedicate some time to go with the full-time trainees to visit the communities and to bring the meetings to people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>BRINGING THE MEETINGS TO THE HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To bring the meetings to the homes is the very heart of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It will be a great failure in the Lord s recovery if we cannot bring the meetings to the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For the past twenty years in the Lord s recovery, we have been bringing people to the meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more we work in this way, the fewer people we have, and the worse the condition of the homes becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>More and more our meetings have become a kind of Sunday morning service.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Christianity many people go to church to listen to the singing of hymns and to attend the service, but their homes are deplorable; their tables may still be scattered with mah-jongg game pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the morning the family attends the service, but in the afternoon the mah-jongg game goes on in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to overturn this degraded situation, we must bring the meetings to the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I hope that every home will be mobilized, that everyone will become a soldier, and that together we will become an army of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At present in Taipei there are about sixty new urban communities.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Let us suppose that we can set up a center for meeting in every community, and every center takes care of fifty people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Immediately we will have three thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If each center takes care of one hundred people, we will have six thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the reason that we must endeavor to work on the communities.</S>
