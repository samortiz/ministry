<h1 class="title">COORDINATING IN ONE ACCORD<br />
TO CARE FOR THE NEW ONES</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You. Thank You that we can be gathered into Your name again. We treasure this time and ask for Your blessing. We pray that You would move among us and have the room to move through every one of us so that You can accomplish Your eternal will. Lord, we look to You to give us a word, Your Spirit, and the anointing. Enlighten us and grant us sight. We pray that You would bless Your church and remember every brother and sister, the home meetings, and every other meeting. We offer our thanksgiving and praise to You. You have led us until now. You are the Lord who leads us, and we bow our heads to worship You. May Your presence be with us. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE FULL-TIME TRAINING</h2>
<p>We will now fellowship concerning the full-time training. Since August 1986 when the first term of the training began, the trainees have baptized more than twenty thousand people who were contacted through door-knocking. Out of these twenty thousand people, more than six thousand have meetings in their homes. Of these six thousand people, nearly four thousand meet with us one or more times a week, and their condition may be considered stable. The remaining two thousand have meetings in their homes at least once a month. The care of all these home meetings is still in the hands of the full-time trainees. Every day they visit and care for these households. Without such care, it is not easy to sustain the newly baptized ones.</p>
<p>In our fellowship with the elders, we expressed the desire to gradually transfer the care of these home meetings to the brothers and sisters in the meeting halls. The transfer cannot be done in a light way. Some of these brothers and sisters have been in the full-time training and are already caring for new ones; hence, it will not be easy for these saints to care for more new ones. In addition, the full-time trainees have been caring for some of the new ones for eight or nine months and for others only one or two months. Hence, some of the new ones are accustomed to the trainees who are caring for them. Therefore, this transfer must be done properly in order to not lose any new ones. Furthermore, the new ones may not be able to accept being cared for by other people.</p>
<p>Therefore, we fellowshipped with the trainees about their burden. Some of the trainees from New Zealand and Europe are willing to stay, but we feel to let them return, because this decision involves the locality they came from. Therefore, we decided that the trainees who wish to remain here must first fellowship with their locality. If their locality is willing to support them, they can stay here for one or two more years. This also applies to the trainees from the localities in Taiwan. Approximately five hundred fifty full-time trainees who have attended two terms of the training are willing to remain. This number includes two hundred fifty trainees from Taipei, one hundred fifty trainees from the localities outside of Taipei, and one hundred fifty trainees from abroad.</p>
<p>The trainees who remain in Taipei will be a strengthening because they will be able to continue caring for the newly baptized saints and to contact people through door-knocking. These trainees were in two terms of the training, and therefore they are all experienced. Hence, if they remain, it will also support the church in Taipei. This is a tremendous strengthening for the growth and spread of the church.</p>
<p>In our fellowship with the elders in Taipei, we asked them to do their best to care for these five hundred fifty trainees and to find lodging for them. These trainees will spend most of their energy to care for the home meetings. We hope that they will be able to build up the new households in one or two years. This will be a tremendous help. All the saints need to know about this situation and receive a burden from the Lord to pray.</p>
<p>At present it seems as if the training will continue every year because there are already more than one thousand university and high school students who have signed up to attend the training. In addition to these students, many saints from other localities have signed up for the training. This is a large number of trainees. It will not be a simple matter to feed these trainees. When we had the largest number of trainees, there were more than one thousand people attending the training and eating meals. We have two kitchens, in hall one and hall three, and about thirty brothers and sisters whose only service is to prepare meals for the training. There are also local saints who come and help with the meals. We thank the Lord that so far all the trainees have been eating well, and the food is healthy. If the training is to continue every year, we must consider the many details related to the training. This is the general situation of the training.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
