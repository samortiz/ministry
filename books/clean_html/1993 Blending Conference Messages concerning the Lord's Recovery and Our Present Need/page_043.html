<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>At Other Times the Apostles with the Disciples Praised God with One Accord</H2><P>At other times the apostles with the disciples praised God with one accord and God's response to them was marvelous, and the heart and soul of the multitude of the believers was one (Acts 4:23-32). After Peter and John were threatened by the Sanhedrin and charged not to speak in the name of Jesus, they returned to their own people and reported to them all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. When they had heard this, the apostles with the disciples offered a wonderful praise and prayer to God in one accord (vv. 24-30). God's response to their prayer and praise was marvelous: "The place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness. And the heart and soul of the multitude of those who had believed was one" (vv. 31-32a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Apostle Charging Us to Keep<br>the Oneness of the Spirit and<br>Giving Us a Clear Picture of How<br>the Oneness of the Body of Christ<br>Is Constituted with the Divine Trinity</H2><P>In Ephesians 4:3-6 the apostle charged us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit and gave us a clear picture of how the oneness of the Body of Christ is constituted with the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence of this inner constitution&#151;and of how the Body is the outward vessel to contain the reality of this constituted oneness between the processed Triune God and the transformed believers.</P><P>In verse 3 the apostle charged us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Spirit is actually the Spirit Himself. Without the Spirit, there is no oneness. If we keep the Spirit, we keep the oneness. The oneness of the Spirit is the oneness that is the Spirit. Not only so, the grammar of these verses shows us that this oneness includes the seven big items in verses 4 through 6: the one Body, the one Spirit, the one hope, the one Lord, the one faith, the one baptism, and the one God and Father of all.</P><P>When we consider these seven items we realize that the three of the Divine Trinity are here. They are all included in the oneness of the Spirit. This causes us to realize that the Spirit is not only the Third of the Divine Trinity, but the Spirit is the realization of the entire Divine Trinity. This Divine Trinity is the constitution of the oneness of the Body of Christ. The oneness of the Body has nothing to do with anything natural. This oneness is absolutely of the Triune God. The Spirit is the essence of this oneness.</P><P>In verses 4-6 the Spirit is mentioned first because the Spirit and the Body are intimately identified. Verse 4 says, "One Body and one Spirit." The Spirit is the life and the content of the one Body. Without the Spirit, the Body is empty. But the Body is not empty, because the one Spirit is within the Body. These two go together with the one hope of our calling. This is the hope that our physical body will be transfigured to be like the Lord's glorious body in His resurrection, as mentioned in Philippians 3:21, and also that we will be fully manifested as the sons of God, as covered in Romans 8:19, 23. This transfiguration and manifestation are not individual. They are placed here exactly with the one Body and the one Spirit. The transfiguration of our body and our manifestation as sons of God are not merely by the Spirit's working in us individually; they are the glorious result of the Spirit's working in the Body.</P>
