   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN GALATIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first chapter of the letter to the Galatians, Paul gives a little history of his background in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He says in effect, "Do not speak to me about religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You could never beat me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was in that, and I was tops in that.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I advanced in religion beyond many of my equals, being 'more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers' " v. 14 . Traditions always go together with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you are strong for tradition, you are strong for religion, and the outcome is that you will persecute the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All those who advocate religion will surely be the persecutors of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Apostle Paul said this himself, once in Galatians 1 and again in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"As touching zeal," Paul said, "persecuting the church" Phil 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, "When I was in religion, I persecuted the church."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you are a real Christian, you are a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But be careful; even as a member of the Body of Christ, if you are religious, you will spontaneously persecute the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I know what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have seen many good Christians, many members of the Body of Christ, who have done much damage to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were simply for religion; they were simply religious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These people justify their actions by pointing out certain verses in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are not the unbelievers, they are not the Jews, they are the real Christians who are so religious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They care for the Christian religion; they do not care for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some would not damage the church openly, but they undermine it in a subtle way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The two outstanding essentials of the church life are: 1 to keep the oneness and 2 to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In fact, all we need for the church life may be summed up in this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The slogan, "In the spirit, on the ground," epitomizes these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"On the ground" means to keep the oneness, and "in the spirit" simply means that we must do everything in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason for all the criticism and persecution of the church life is simply due to these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>People care more for religion than being in the spirit and keeping the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we mean business for the church life, we must be all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unless the church is involved in sin, immorality, or idolatry, we must go along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether the meetings are noisy or silent, whether the saints speak in tongues or do not speak in tongues, whether they pray-read or do not pray-read, we must keep the oneness in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose a brother comes in with bare feet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot chase him away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot say, "Brother, go home and get your shoes; otherwise, you cannot come back."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as he believes in the Lord Jesus, as long as he loves the Lord Jesus, he is our dear brother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must love him, not because he has bare feet, but because he has Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you feel you must speak in tongues, then speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you feel that as a sister you should have your head covered, then cover it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you prefer not to cover your head, then do not trouble those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Would you, or could you be so all-inclusive?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The problem today is this: those who speak in tongues always insist that others should speak in tongues, and those who do not speak in tongues would prohibit all others from doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not care for religion; we should only care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we only care for Christ, nothing will bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We will be one with all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we all care for Christ and nothing else, we will always be one; there will be no problem.</S>
