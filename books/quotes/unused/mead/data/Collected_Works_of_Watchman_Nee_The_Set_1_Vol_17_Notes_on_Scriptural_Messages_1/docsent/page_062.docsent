   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR LORD'S SANCTIFYING HIMSELF Issue No. 23 Scripture Reading: John 17:16-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today I am going to focus on verse 19, which says that the Lord sanctified Himself for the disciples' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The verses we read today are somewhat peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord's desire that His disciples be sanctified required Him to first sanctify Himself for their sake.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why was this so?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people have a problem when they read these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is He not holy?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is not His nature holy?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why did He have to sanctify Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today I will again speak briefly on the Lord's conduct while He was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our Lord is holy in His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He never knew sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is also God and has the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In regard to Himself, He can do many things, and He can do them at will without contradicting His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In regard to His power, He is able to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has His independent power and can do things without waiting for God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet our Lord never spoke or acted in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In everything, He was under the control of the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He even said, "I can do nothing from Myself" John 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the Lord acted according to His own will and power, would His acts have been counted as sin like ours?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No, a thousand times no!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why then did He not act according to His own will and by His own power?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was sanctifying Himself for His disciples' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When He could have been free, He chose not to be free; when He could have exercised power, He chose not to exercise power, in order to set a good example for His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is holy, and He could have followed His own will and exercised His own power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if His disciples followed their own will and exercised their own power that would have been sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord had His freedom and could have done many things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But for the disciples' sake, He was glad to be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, for the sake of the disciples, the Lord gave up His own freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He laid aside many of His rights and gave up a great deal of His personal freedom, in order to show His disciples that they should not act freely before God or exercise their own power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If He did not act or exercise freely, should not we do the same?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, have you ever considered the Lord's life on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His entire life on earth was altogether under restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is God, yet He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He could have lived without eating and drinking, yet like all other men He hungered and thirsted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is God, yet He became a baby.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is absolutely great, yet He grew up according to man's stature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is such a glorious God, yet He was put into an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our Lord must have labored on earth more than any other person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once the Lord told the Jews, "Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Jews said, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 8:56-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>O friends, do you know why the Jews spoke such a word?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They purposely wanted to reduce the Lord's age by a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I truly believe the words in Isaiah 52:14 and 53:2, "His appearance was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>/ Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time the Lord was only thirty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Jews purposely wanted to lower His age; yet they said He was close to fifty years old!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This shows how old the Lord's countenance appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He indeed was a man that had fully experienced the sufferings of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You could see this from His face.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let me tell you that this was only a restriction that He faced in His physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do not know the sufferings he experienced due to spiritual restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our Lord is truly holy and without lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although He had the liberty to do many things, He did not do them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He acted in this way for the sake of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once a man came to Peter and said, "Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Peter said, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord did not have to pay the temple tax, but in order not to offend them, He said to Peter, "Go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you" Matt 17:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Peter should have paid the temple tax; the Lord should not have paid the temple tax.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But for Peter's sake, the Lord sanctified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord wanted Peter to know that he should submit to governmental authority; therefore, He paid the temple tax.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For Peter's sake, the Lord restricted Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord was seized as He came out of the garden of Gethsemane, Peter stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What did the Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He said, "Do you think that I cannot beseech My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than twelve legions of angels?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Matt 26:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But why did the Lord not do this?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For the sake of His disciples, the Lord sanctified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord was concerned about what the disciples would do in the future if He beseeched the Father to provide Him with twelve legions of angels.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They might, for example, order fire to come down from heaven to consume the Samaritans.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord could beseech the Father to provide twelve legions of angels, but His disciples could not order fire to come down from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, for the sake of His disciples, the Lord did not do this; He sanctified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was restricted by the disciples.</S>
