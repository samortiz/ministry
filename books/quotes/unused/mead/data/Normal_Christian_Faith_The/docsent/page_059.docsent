   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ONLY WAY AN EXCHANGE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was there when that story happened.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that trying to improve our human behavior is just like cleaning the faces of those dolls.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We think that if we rid ourselves of our proud attitude and all our lies and behave in a more refined way, we will be a better person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is our human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God says that the outward corruption of man is caused by an inward corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The only solution is a basic change of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The recognition of the hopelessness and wickedness of man and the realization of the need for an exchange are the basic foundation in our Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>MAN'S HEART IS FILLED WITH EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day I was walking down a street in Shanghai with a friend of mine who has a very active mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said to me, "It is a pity that we cannot see through another's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Would not it be interesting if I could tell at a glance what this person or that person was thinking?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What a pity that we cannot see through the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I said, "This is far from being a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am relieved at not being able to see through another's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not try to guess what others think, because all of man's thoughts are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is nothing other than stealing, deceiving, and treachery in our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no good thought.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the thoughts have to be kept secret.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is fortunate that the heart is concealed from our sight by a few bones and some skin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we could see it clearly, we would loathe it immediately."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE NEED OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the salvation of man cannot start from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It has to start from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason there is the need of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regeneration simply means to cast off the dirty, corrupted life that we have and exchange it for a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is analogous to changing a fish's life for a bird's life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There will be no need to teach the fish to fly anymore; it will fly naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the present we will not mention the way to regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We just want to know what regeneration is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Giving up a life of sin and replacing it by a holy life is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>CORRUPTED FROM WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A few years ago I was in Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day I was preaching in the villages with another co-worker by the name of Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By the time we completed our visits, it was close to midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We were both very thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the shops along the way were closed, and there was nowhere that we could find water.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Approaching the end of a little town, we saw a small grocery store with its door still open.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With much joy we bought two big pears.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ones we picked were the biggest and cleanest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There was no hole or any bad spot outside.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We took them with us and ate them on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After a while we tasted something strange.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we examined the pears under a lamp, we found that they were bad inside.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only thing we could do was pick out the worms and eat the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I told Brother Wang, "The skin of these pears looked so shiny; there was no hole anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do you know how those worms got inside the pears?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let me tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the pear tree was still blossoming, the worms had already laid eggs in the pear flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the flowers wilted and the pears were formed, the eggs hatched and grew inside them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Outwardly, these pears looked nice, but inside they were filled with worms."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is just what we have been talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The evil of man is not merely in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The basic problem is that he is corrupted in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The salvation of Christianity is not a change of our outward behavior, but an exchange of our inward life.</S>
