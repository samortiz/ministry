<h2 class="head2">The Old Testament Saints Musing on God<br />
and Living before Him</h2>
<p>The Old Testament saints knew that if they desired to live before God, they had to focus their minds on God and the things of God. Most of the words in the Psalms describe how the pious lived before God. They often turned their mind to God and to the things of God. To muse on Jehovah in the Psalms is equivalent to setting the mind on the spirit in Romans 8:6. The words of David in Psalm 104:34 are very precious. He said, &ldquo;May my musing be sweet to Him.&rdquo; A footnote in Darby&rsquo;s New Translation says that this can also be rendered, &ldquo;My meditation of him is shall be pleasant.&rdquo; On the one hand, God regards our musing to be sweet; He likes us to muse on Him. On the other hand, musing on God is sweet and pleasant to us. This is indeed true. When we muse on God, we feel sweet within. To muse on God is to turn our thoughts from everything apart from God to Him. Our person follows our thoughts and runs to whatever we think about. The expression <em>absent-minded</em> indicates that the mind is constantly running toward different things. When we muse on God, our mind runs toward God.</p>
<p>Psalm 1:2 speaks of a person whose delight is in the law of Jehovah and who meditates in His law by day and by night. This shows how much the Old Testament saints mused on God and lived before Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowship Beginning with Our Emotion</h2>
<p>Since the Spirit has entered into our spirit, we must turn to our spirit in order to contact God. However, we must remember that fallen man lives in the mind. The mind represents our person; hence, our person follows our mind. Although our mind represents our person, our mind cannot lead us, and even though it may seem as if we are being led by our will, we are actually being led by our emotion.</p>
<p>According to Psalm 1:2, a person who delights in the law of Jehovah muses on the law of God, meditating on it by day and by night. To delight in something involves our emotions. We cannot ask a person who dislikes God, does not consider Him to be sweet, and has no love for Him to set his mind on God. If our emotions do not like a certain thing, our mind is not of much help to us. A person who loves the world rather than God will fall asleep when he tries to mind the spirit.</p>
<p>We must turn our mind to our spirit in order to muse on God, but we also need to stir up our emotions so that we lean toward Him, long for Him, and love Him. This was the experience of the psalmists: &ldquo;As the hart pants / After the streams of water, / So my soul pants / For You, O God&rdquo; (42:1). Only those who love God will think of Him. Those who do not love God cannot be exhorted, much less be forced, to think about Him. In order for our mind to continually remember and consider God, our emotions must be touched by Him, encouraged by His love, and moved by His loveliness and sweetness.</p>
<p>Song of Songs speaks of the love of a believer toward the Lord. No other book in the Bible speaks as thoroughly of our fellowship with the Lord. According to Song of Songs, there must be love before there can be fellowship. This is also true in our dealings with others. If you do not love me, you will not want to fellowship with me. We fellowship regularly with those whom we love. Similarly, if we love the Lord, we will desire to fellowship with Him, and our mind will spontaneously turn to our spirit and muse on Him. Merely loving the Lord is not fellowship. Only by turning to our spirit can we enter into fellowship. Loving the Lord is the motive for fellowship. It is the main source that motivates us to fellowship with the Lord, but loving the Lord is not fellowship. In order to fellowship, we must touch our spirit with our mind.</p>
<p>In Romans 12 the apostle first exhorts us through the compassions of God, and then he speaks of being transformed by the renewing of our mind (vv. 1-2). His exhorting through the compassions of God is to stir up our emotion with God&rsquo;s love. The apostle knew that only when our emotion is moved will our mind turn to God and be transformed. When our emotions are inclined toward God and we love and desire Him, nothing will hinder our mind from turning to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowship Being Carried Out by Our Will</h2>
<p>In addition to our mind and emotion, we also have a will. There are several places in the Bible that speak of exercising the will in order to fellowship with the Lord. Imperative statements, such as &ldquo;hope in God&rdquo; (Psa. 42:5, 11; 43:5) and &ldquo;wait in silence for God alone&rdquo; (62:5), involve the exercise of the will. Even after our emotions are moved by His love and our mind turns to our spirit, we still need to exercise our will in order to fellowship. The decision to fellowship with God is the responsibility of our will.</p>
<p>An indifferent person has a weak will. It is difficult for such a one to learn the lesson of fellowship. Those who learn the lesson of fellowship have a strong will. When their emotions are not stirred up, they can exercise their will to turn their mind to their spirit. Their will is able to control their restless mind and turn it to their spirit. Those with a strong will can have deep fellowship with the Lord. Statements such as &ldquo;O my soul...Hope in God&rdquo; (42:5, 11; 43:5) and &ldquo;my soul, wait in silence for God alone&rdquo; (62:5) indicate that the psalmists were downcast and needed to exercise their strong will in order to direct their heart toward the Lord and thereby enter into fellowship.</p>
<p>The New Testament also shows the relationship between the will and fellowship. Statements such as &ldquo;unceasingly pray&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:17), &ldquo;praying at every time in spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 6:18), &ldquo;they ought always to pray&rdquo; (Luke 18:1), &ldquo;rejoice in the Lord&rdquo; (Phil. 3:1), &ldquo;casting all your anxiety on Him&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:7), and &ldquo;in nothing be anxious&rdquo; (Phil. 4:6) are in the imperative mood and command us to exercise our will in order to fellowship with the Lord. We often excuse ourselves and say that we cannot pray because we are not in a good mood or that our thoughts are scattered. Some believers say that they cannot pray because they are in a bad mood or because their mind is not calm. Such believers can be compared to a rudderless boat that is being directed only by the wind and the waves without a definite goal. The rudder, however, is needed to control, stabilize, and direct a boat to sail toward a definite goal, even when there is a storm. This illustrates the relationship between our will and fellowship.</p>
<p>Both our mind and our emotions are indispensable in learning to live in fellowship, but our will is more important. Our mind and our emotions are both unreliable. We behave one way when we are happy and another way when we are unhappy. Our will is our most reliable part; it is our rudder. A normal, noble, and proper person does everything by his will. He has feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, but he does not express himself based on these feelings, because he is controlled by his will. He may be grieved and feel the need to weep, but he is controlled by his will; hence, he shows no sign of grief. A person with a strong will knows how to use his mind to exercise discernment and caution, but his behavior is still controlled by his will. He is not without thoughts or emotions. His thoughts are rich, and his emotions are fervent, but they are under the control of his will.</p>
<p>Without a strong will, a person cannot stop his wandering mind or calm his agitated emotions. When such persons are angry, their anger is wild, and their love is intense and often unbearable. Such persons often fail because they lack a strong will as their rudder.</p>
<p>Although the Lord is in us as our life and power, He needs our cooperation in order to be expressed through us. When the Lord moves within us, there will be no effect if our will does not carry it out. Hence, we must adjust our mind, emotion, and will if we desire to live in fellowship with the Lord. Our mind is adjusted when it turns to our spirit. Our emotion is adjusted when we exercise to love God and make Him the unique object of our love. Our will is adjusted when we use it to carry out spiritual activities. When we feel down, we should exercise our will and pray or contemplate the Lord. When we do not have inspiration, we must exercise our will and pray from our spirit. We often say that we need to exercise our spirit, but the exercise of our spirit requires a strong will. A person who does not have a strong will does not have a strong spirit and cannot readily release his spirit. Such a person is either tossed about by his emotions or scattered in his mind. Hence, it is difficult for him to turn to his spirit and for his spirit to be released. In order to be freed from the encumbrances of our emotion and mind, we must have a strong will. Then we can force ourselves to exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>If we practice exercising our will, both our mind and our emotions will be strengthened. By exercising his will, a brother who rarely thinks about God will begin to consider Him. Similarly, when a sister who is slothful in her emotions and is indifferent toward God exercises her will, she will love God and want to live in His presence. This also applies to the spirit. A brother who is deflated in his spirit often waits for his spirit to move, but this rarely happens. Instead, he should exercise his will to move his spirit and pray. Initially, this may be difficult, but if he continues to exercise his will in this regard, his spirit will become burning, and he will be unable to stop praying. Our spirit, our mind, and our emotion can become slothful, just as we can become lazy. Hence, we need to exercise our will in order to move our spirit, our mind, and our emotion.</p>
<p>A car is powered by gasoline, but in order for the gasoline to burn, the engine must be ignited. If instead of igniting the engine, a person waits for the gasoline to ignite by itself, the car will never start. A car is not driven by electricity, but electricity is needed in order for the engine to be ignited. Similarly, in order to pray or fellowship with the Lord, we do not rely on our will but on our spirit. However, it is vain to wait for our spirit to stir itself up. We must use our will to stir up our spirit, just as the ignition starts a car. Strictly speaking, exercising our spirit is equivalent to using our will to move our spirit. The only way to exercise our spirit is to use our will. As those who desire to learn to fellowship and pray, we must learn to exercise our will. If we do not learn to exercise our will, we will not learn to fellowship.</p>
<p>A brother who is not willing to pray should force himself to pray. He should force his mind to consider God. Initially, this may seem awkward. The Bible does not tell us to wait for our spirit to be moved. Rather, it uses imperatives in regard to praying, to proclaiming the word, to testifying, to praising, and to giving thanks in everything (Matt. 24:20; 2 Tim. 4:2; John 15:27; Psa. 22:23; 1 Thes. 5:18). This shows that we need to be active, to take the initiative, and to not wait passively. If we wait to be inspired, inspiration may never come. When we do not have an appetite for food, we must use our will and force ourselves to eat something. In spiritual matters, however, we often are not willing to force ourselves to exercise.</p>
<p>Many believers wait for inspiration, and they are not willing to move without inspiration. To them exercising their spirit is a man-made effort to stir up excitement. Instead of waiting for inspiration, we should exercise our will. When we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to remember and worship Him, we should know that we are here to take care of business and not to wait for inspiration. A teacher does not wait to be inspired before she begins to teach her class. Since we are here to take care of business, we should exercise our will. To worship the Lord is a matter in spirit; hence, we ought to use our will to stir up the spirit to praise, pray, and call hymns. Regrettably, in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting some saints feel no obligation to take care of business. They use their will to direct their mind, rather than their spirit. Many saints are relaxed in spirit, and they do not use their will to direct their spirit to function. As a result, the meeting lacks the operation of the spirit. If our will is not exercised, our spirit will not be strong. As those who desire to live in fellowship, we must learn to exercise our will.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
