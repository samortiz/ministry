   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE PRODUCING OF THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE FLOW OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE DEATH, RESURRECTION, AND ASCENSION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Psa 68:18; 36:8; Eph 4:11-12</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Amplified Bible renders Psalm 68:18 as, You have ascended on high.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have led away captive a train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may also render the last phrase, a host of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was on the cross and by His resurrection that the Lord vanquished the foes, defeated them, and disarmed them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then when He ascended to the heavens, He led a train, a parade, of defeated foes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the ancient times, when a general went to war, gained the victory, and captured his foes, he returned victoriously with a train of defeated foes in a parade to show his victory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the thought in Psalm 68:18.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ was the General who went to the battlefield and won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He defeated the foes, disarmed them, and captured them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then they became a parading train, a host, a defeated army, to show people what kind of victory the General had won.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christ ascended on high to the heavens, He led away such a parade of defeated foes to show His victory and declare that all the negative things in the universe had been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE FLOW OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this time we have gained more understanding concerning Christ s ascending on high.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Triune God, the Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow within the course.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Father is the source, the fountain, of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This source flows out through the Son, who is the course.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this course there is the flow of the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the Triune God flowing out and flowing into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not a human thought; this is the true revelation of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Throughout the past twenty centuries, only a few Christian teachers here and there have touched this matter a little.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Generally speaking, nearly all of Christianity has lost this concept and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In these last days we have the inner sense of the moving Spirit that the Lord will recover this once more.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Again and again the ministering Spirit has been striving to this end.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the beginning of the Bible there was a flow beside the tree of life Gen 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then this flow is found throughout the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament there is the smitten rock that flowed out the living water Exo 17:6 , and there is the flow in Psalm 46:4, Ezekiel 47:1-12, and Zechariah 14:8.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Testament there is the flow of living water in John 4 and 7 and in 1 Corinthians 10 and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 13 of chapter twelve says that we were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that the Spirit is water to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually we come to Revelation 21 and 22, where we again see the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This flow is the water of life, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Bible there are several portions that tell us that God is the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Psalm 36:8 and 9 say, They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>/ For with You is the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This verse speaks of both the river and the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is the living water to us; this is the divine concept, the divine thought.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE FLOW PRODUCING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A UNIVERSAL MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow within the course.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do want you to be impressed by this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hymns, #12 says, O God, Thou art the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This source of life flows out in the Son and as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually this flow of living water the Triune God in three persons flows into us, the man of spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Genesis 2:10 the river in the garden divided and became four branches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Four here represents man, meaning that this one river flows to this man and into man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From Himself as the source, God flows out and flows into man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This flowing out and flowing in eventually issues in a universal mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is by this flow that God is brought into man, and it is also by this flow that man is brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the Lord said, Abide in Me and I in you John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who is this Me?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To abide in Me means to abide in God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who then is this I?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>John 14:20 says, In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the mingling of God with man by the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I wish to make this very clear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is something very basic concerning the inner life and the church life.</S>
