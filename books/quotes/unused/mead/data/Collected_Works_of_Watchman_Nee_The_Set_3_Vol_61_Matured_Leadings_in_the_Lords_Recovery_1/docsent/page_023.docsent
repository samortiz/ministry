   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX FORSAKING EVERYTHING FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GOSPEL'S SAKE Date:November 21, 1949</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Brother Cheng's house, Hong Kong FORSAKING EVERYTHING FOR THE GOSPEL'S SAKE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church accomplishes much more and produces more results during times of trial than during times of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The darker the environment, the brighter the church shines, and the more thriving it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because the church receives from the very transcendent life of the resurrected Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more this life is placed in a difficult and trying situation, the more resilient it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The persecution of the church in Smyrna represents the persecution of the church under the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>History tells us that the result of that persecution was a proliferation of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God never contradicts His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Similarly, His life never contradicts its own law; it never yields to persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has no intention to spare His church from persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He only has promised that the church would be built on the rock Jesus Christ, and that the gates of Hades would not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The gospel is powerful because the Lord Jesus has resurrected from the dead, bringing life and incorruption to light through the gospel 2 Tim 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a consequence, the Lord challenges men to leave their possessions and relatives "for My sake and for the gospel's sake" Mark 10:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not say "for My sake" only, but "for My sake and for the gospel's sake."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the Lord's life, the gospel is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gospel is the proclamation of the victorious and resurrected life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a man believes in the gospel, that is, if he believes in the risen Christ, he has life in him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord spoke this word after He met the rich young ruler who went away in sorrow vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>17-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He thought that the Lord Jesus' demand was too high and that no man could fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was not only the thought of the rich young ruler; it was also the thought of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They asked, "Then who can be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord answered, "With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>23-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This passage clearly shows us that we cannot give ourselves to the gospel unless we give ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to be for the Lord and for His gospel, however, we have to forsake everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is impossible with men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After receiving the resurrection life of the Lord through faith, however, we can and will do it happily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Himself forsook everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the parable of the treasure and the pearl in Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He was the One who sold everything to buy the treasure the kingdom and the pearl the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The apostle Paul also said that the Lord Jesus was rich but was made poor for our sake so that we could become rich through His poverty 2 Cor 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the gospel which He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, when we preach the gospel, we have to be like the Lord who forsook everything in order that others would share the blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE REASON THE GOSPEL HAS LOST ITS IMPACT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today the gospel has lost the impact it had at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because no one is forsaking everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people say that their time, money, and all are for the Lord, but it is hard to find one or two in a hundred who really mean what they say.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The rest only say this with their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In reality, everything is still theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The gospel has lost its initial impact because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Being a Christian is a secondary profession to many people; their primary profession is not being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The order of things has been reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul clearly said, "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised" 2 Cor 5:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ died and resurrected for us so that we may no longer live to ourselves but to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But how many people are living to the Lord today?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people are Christians in name, but they really live in the same way as the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The world seeks fame, fortune, position, and education.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These Christians seek the same.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They glorify their pursuit by saying that they are pursuing these things for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, their Christian confession is a secondary profession.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The gospel has lost its power because Christians today are short of a full consecration and do not practice their Christian confession as their primary profession.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the beginning of the church age, everyone was fully consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They were in one accord, and the gospel was powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although there were false consecrations like those of Ananias and Sapphira, the church was still victorious in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There was falsehood, but there was also judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Holy Spirit was still able to take control in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the reason the gospel was able to spread and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The disciples in the church in Jerusalem were dispersed through persecution Acts 8:1 , but thirty years later, when Paul went up to Jerusalem, thousands of new believers had been added 21:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since the Ming Dynasty, the Catholic Church has been working over three hundred years in China.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Its number is about three million.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Protestantism began in China with Robert Morrison, and it has been here for over a hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet it has only four hundred eighty thousand believers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Compared with the beginning, the church today has failed miserably in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The basic reason the gospel has lost its impact is because men no longer forsake their all like the first believers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church should have taken over the responsibility of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It should be the overcomers among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Jewish nation has been destroyed for 2,565 years, but the church has not overcome yet.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is because it has lost the early practice of total consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At the time of the Lord Jesus' ministry on earth, those who believed in Him were called disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They were not called doctors, merchants, laborers, or teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After the church came into being, there were only Christians in the church, not doctors, merchants, laborers, or teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Perhaps you will say that Luke was a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Indeed he was, but he was a doctor on the side.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we read the Gospel of Luke and Acts, we have the impression that Luke was Paul's co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We do not have the impression that he was a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Paul said that he was an ambassador for Christ 2 Cor 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Since he was an ambassador, he did not have a second occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Paul called Luke a doctor because Luke took care of him Col 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This did not refer to his profession but to his work of caring for Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In reading Acts, we only find Luke as a co-worker of Paul; no attention is paid to the fact that he was a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He did not have the air of a doctor with him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Similarly, in reading the New Testament, we do not have an impression that Paul was a tentmaker.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He was an apostle appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He was a worker of God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Today many Christians have lost their flavor as disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Their mind is full of commercial thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All the time they think about making more money.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They make the money but lose both their testimony and the power of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we want to be for the Lord's gospel, we have to cast aside our own occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This does not mean that we no longer have a job.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Many people still need a job on the side, but these jobs must be compatible with our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They must make us love the Lord's church more, and they must supply our needs and the needs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Nothing discredits God's glory more than depending on others' love more than depending on one's own faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Paul made tents so that he could be an apostle more effectively and thus maintain his apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>One should take up a job not for the purpose of making money but for maintaining his Christian status.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If a Christian takes a job purely for the sake of making money, God's house will become a market for oxen and sheep and doves.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It will no longer be a house of prayer for the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We must beware of making too much money.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The cork in a bottle must be unplugged before its precious content can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The more we hold on to material goods, the more the gospel will be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The more we love ourselves, the less His life will flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In order for the gospel to have the impact, we must remove the "cork."</S>
