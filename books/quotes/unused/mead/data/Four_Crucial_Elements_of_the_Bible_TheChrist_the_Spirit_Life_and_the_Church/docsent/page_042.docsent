   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRIUNE GOD IN 2 CORINTHIANS 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apparently, these are three items, but they are actually three aspects of one item.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Love is in the heart and is altogether a matter of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Grace comes out of a loving heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When love in the heart is stirred and manifested, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, when we see a lovable person, our heart loves him, and we may give him a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This gift, which is the manifestation of love, is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When that person receives the gift, he comes into fellowship and contact with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, love, grace, and fellowship are just three aspects of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, God's heart loves us; this is God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Out of God's love there is a manifestation, which is to give us His only begotten Son John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John 1:14 says that this only begotten Son became flesh to tabernacle among us, full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 14 does not say full of love but full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's giving us His Son is love, and the Son's coming is full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, love becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Grace is not wages but a free gift through love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The love that is in the Father becomes grace in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, when the Father's love is expressed, it is the Son's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the reaching of grace for us to receive and enjoy is accomplished by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, John 20:22 and Acts 2:4 show us that the Triune God reaching us is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Holy Spirit reaches us, He transmits the Father's love and the Son's grace for our enjoyment and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The result is that we have fellowship with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, when love is manifested, it becomes grace, and when grace is received by us, it becomes fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are three aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, when God is expressed, He is Christ, who is God becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When this Christ is received by us, He is the Spirit because what we receive is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, there is no way that we can experience Christ without experiencing the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Christ whom we experience is the Triune God; the God whom we enjoy is the Triune God; and the Holy Spirit whom we have received is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father is the Triune God, the Son is the Triune God, and the Spirit is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Three should not and cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is greatly different from the teaching concerning the Trinity in traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>VERSES IN THE SCRIPTURE REFERRING TO THE SPIRIT AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT John 3:6</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are the Triune God, and the Triune God reaches us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We thank the Lord that He reaches us as the Spirit, and we humans also have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ultimate expression of the Triune God is the Spirit the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit first came to us to sanctify us that we might be saved 1 Pet 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then, when we are saved, He comes into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Holy Spirit comes into us by coming into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This can be proven by several verses in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this verse there are two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first is the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, and the second is that which is born of the Spirit, which is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we believe into the Lord by repenting and confessing our sins to Him, we are forgiven and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once we are saved, God's Spirit immediately comes into us to regenerate our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, we are regenerated when the Spirit of the Triune God enters into our spirit to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be saved is not to believe in a religion; rather, it is to receive another life into us in addition to our original human life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This other life is the divine life, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Spirit comes into us to regenerate our spirit with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
