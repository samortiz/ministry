   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For the Lord s sake, we may forgive others mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But to be saved from remembering others mistakes is to be saved to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may forgive others and yet still remember their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may even tell others, This brother offended me in a certain matter, but I have forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This shows that we forgive, but we still remember the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible tells us that when God forgives us, He forgets Heb 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why some have said that to forgive is to forget.</S>

   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have to be saved to the uttermost in our forgiving of others and from all our daily troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we come forward to God through Christ, our High Priest, He saves us in the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10 and by the law of the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
