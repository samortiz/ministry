   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Campus Work in Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today, if we send all the co-workers left behind in Shanghai to the campuses, it will not be enough to meet the need of the three universities alone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I venture to say that it is not suitable for the co-workers here in Shanghai to go to Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Chiao-tung University, National Medical University, and Shanghai Medical University alone, we have enough work to do already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chiao-tung University has two to three thousand students.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Shanghai Medical University has a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past, when the Western missionaries came to preach the gospel, they had to build their own houses and hire their own people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But now everything is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ones to preach the gospel are there, and the ones to hear the gospel are also there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The chairs and the lights are all there in the auditoriums already, and everything is so convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today among us, we have seventy to eighty university students.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Chiao-tung University, sixty students are breaking the bread there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In National Medical University, we have a few dozen students.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we are short of people, and we are short of money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are short of these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Recently we bought a car, two passenger vans, and a big bus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Campus Work in Nanking</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Nanking, we have not officially started our work yet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But at present, there are five hundred people breaking the bread there already.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We notice that in Nanking there are students who come from the remote regions of China.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At present, there are some brothers in the church who can speak the native Sinkiang language.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once when I was preaching the gospel there, the dean of a certain school stood up to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After these brothers and sisters receive four years of spiritual education, they can become our "commando" units when they graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not let them go, then there is nothing to it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we let them go, these ones will go back to their home provinces to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They will go to Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Tibet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The problem is still the lack of money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These schools are in Shia-kwang district.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a problem for the students to come up with enough money to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, God has done much work on the campuses, and the door of the gospel is wide open.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BROTHER NEE'S FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee: Perhaps Brother Lee will say that I have left too few co-workers in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But it is not an easy thing to make arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have opened up my spirit to the brothers, and I hope that the brothers will also open up their spirit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At present, the need in Shanghai cannot be met yet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Lee's family cannot move here yet, and Brother David Hsu's family cannot move here either.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Chang Yu-tse said that he will have to return home.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Kang has quit his job at the China Textile Corporation, and he can no longer live in its dormitory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Tang Shou-ling will also quit his teaching job soon.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have a big need in preparing the outward matters to match the spiritual move.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people criticize us in a cheap way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the end, they will not move even a little finger.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We co-workers are working with a burden on our shoulders; we are not working in a light-hearted manner.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people are here only as spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our words are not for you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today in the Northwest, some still have to testify to their faith by their own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can only help them in our prayers.</S>
