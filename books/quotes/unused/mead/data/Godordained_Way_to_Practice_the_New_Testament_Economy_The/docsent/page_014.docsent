   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Believers Homes</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believers first met in the homes beginning on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Three thousand met from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek indicates that they met according to houses, which means that every house had a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was a meeting in every new believer s house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This could only happen by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, there were many calling on the name of the Lord Acts 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the home meetings, according to Acts 2:46 and 5:42, there were preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, breaking bread to remember the Lord, and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The saints around the time of Pentecost broke bread every day, that is, they had the remembrance of the Lord by practicing the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The saints also prayed in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 12:12 tells us that when Peter was released from prison, he went to the house of Mary where a group of saints were praying.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Meeting in the believers homes is for all the members of Christ to function.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In any big meeting it is hard for the saints to function.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in a small meeting with four or five, or two or three, even a small boy or girl could function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He or she could say, The Lord Jesus loves me, and it is so good that I love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a small function, but do not despise it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The new believers will function in a small way at first, but from that point, they will continue to progress in life and in function.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By the functioning of all the members, the small home meetings will grow and be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a new couple brings forth a little infant, they have the faith that their family will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The same applies to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should exercise our faith and practice the home meetings with much expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Matthew 18:20, in speaking about Christian gatherings, the Lord Jesus used the number of two or three: For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Two or three is a precious number in the Bible, and should be the starting number of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the church becomes big through the home meetings, the big meetings will be meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when the church does not have anything and expects to have a big meeting, that big meeting may be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To start the church life from a small meeting of two or three is best.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of us like to start a meeting with a lot of people, yet the more people you have as a start in a meeting, the more trouble you will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1949 when we began the ministry on the island of Taiwan, we called a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the first Lord s day morning, close to four hundred came.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most of them were newcomers who had just come from mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They were Christians who did not have a place to worship, so when they heard about the gathering at the meeting hall, they came.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I looked at the number, I realized that it was too many, so I immediately gave a message saying, The church here does not help people in marriage, nor does it help people get jobs, nor does it help people financially.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church here only preaches Christ and ministers Christ to people as their life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are seeking after Christ you are the right person to come here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, you have the wrong place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I then gave an illustration about the different kinds of restaurants among the Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are the Shanghainese who like to eat Shanghai food and the Cantonese who like to eat Canton food.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Different Christian assemblies stress different things like different restaurants.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are Shanghainese and go to a Cantonese restaurant, you will feel that you are in the wrong place, because you cannot get the Shanghai food.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then I told them again, The church here does not help people in marriage, finance, or employment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We only help people to know the Lord Jesus, receive Him, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are such a person, you have come to the right place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please continue to come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After I gave that message, half of the number returned for the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I said to myself, These are the genuine ones seeking after Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the saints recorded the names, there were nearly two hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This number formed the start of the church life in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To begin the church life with a lesser number is better.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not despise the small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In these small meetings, we should preach the gospel, teach the truth, break bread to remember the Lord, pray, and give the opportunity for each attendant to function.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In a Larger Meeting Place</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church should also have large meetings in a larger place for the whole church to come together 1 Cor 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are two kinds of meetings: small meetings in the homes of the believers and large meetings in a larger meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These large meetings should not be held often.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To have these larger meetings should not be a constant practice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you practice the large meetings constantly, you will deaden the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must learn to have the two kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God s design of our body is symmetrical.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, two lips, two shoulders, two arms, two hands, two thighs, two legs, and two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, we need to begin the meeting in small homes; on the other hand, when the need arises we should hold large meetings in a larger meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the larger meeting place, we should not have any definite speaker with all the congregation listening to this speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must kill this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In such a meeting all the attendants should participate in the building up of the church through their functions 1 Cor 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we come together one may have a revelation, another may have a hymn, another one may have a teaching, and others may have another portion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everyone can and should have something of Christ for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all need to have something so that we can function in the meetings for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No Chairman, No Leaders, and No Formalities</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In both the small and large meetings there should be no chairman, no leaders, and no formalities.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This will annul Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the chairman, leaders, and formalities are taken away from Christianity, there is nothing left.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In every meeting all the attendants should participate.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They can pray, offer some praise to God, call a hymn, take the lead to sing a hymn, read the Scriptures, or give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This makes the meeting different from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>By practicing to give time and opportunity to all the attendants to function, all the saints may render their help, and the entire church will get the benefit 1 Cor 14:26, 31 .</S>
