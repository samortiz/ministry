   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAST PART OF THE JOURNEY Issue No. 24 Scripture Reading: Mark 6:45-52</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This passage of the Bible has often been a help to me; even now it is a continuous help to me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The passage prior to Mark 6:45-52 speaks of the Lord Jesus feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The passage following Mark 6:45-52 speaks of the Lord Jesus healing many who were sick.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These three events form a large type prefiguring the time of the Lord Jesus' death on the cross to the time of His establishing the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They tell us how the Lord: 1 was crucified for us, 2 ascended to the heaven to become the High Priest for our sake, and 3 will descend again in the future to establish the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 6 also records the Lord feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fish, but the record is lengthier.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It says that after the Lord Jesus distributed the loaves and fish, He continued to speak a very important teaching: "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven" v. 51 . The Lord meant that just as the people were filled with bread that day, they would have eternal life by similarly eating His flesh and drinking His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the Lord's distribution of the bread typifies His death for us in which His body was broken and His precious blood was shed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mark 6:46 says, "He went away to the mountain to pray."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This typifies the Lord ascending to the heavens to become the High Priest to pray for us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Mark 6:53-56 typifies the Lord coming again to establish His kingdom and heal many who are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What we will cover today is the account of the Lord compelling the disciples to journey across the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This event was inserted between the cross and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is an event for today, an event for the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It speaks of the things that will transpire and the attitude we should have during the period of time after the cross and before the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For now, I will not emphasize what the Lord has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, I will emphasize what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 45 says, "And immediately He compelled His disciples to step into the boat and go before to the other side, toward Bethsaida, while He sent the crowd away."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, this verse tells us that everyone of us has a journey ordained by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word "compelled" here is the same as the word "constrains" used in 2 Corinthians 5:14.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord constrained the disciples to step into the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord has died for them and is now constraining them to take the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord has one journey for His disciples, and He constrained them to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The most important thing in the Christian life is to seek out the journey which the Lord has ordained and faithfully walk on it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A poor phenomenon among believers today is that many have not found the journey that the Lord has ordained for them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some, even though they have found it, do not walk on it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reason that their living is filled with so much spiritual death, gloom, and restriction, and this is the reason that there are so many conflicts and arguments in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most important task for each of us is to put ourselves into God's hand in a quiet, patient, prayerful, consecrated, and obedient way and wholeheartedly seek after His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should be willing to obey Him and act only in accordance with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should pray that He reveal to us the journey He has designated for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After this, we should pay any price to wholeheartedly walk on it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know that the feeding of the bread took place in Bethsaida Luke 9:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From the map we can see that there were two cities named Bethsaida, one to the northeast of Capernaum and the other to the southwest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord commanded them to start from the Bethsaida in the northeast and sail to the other side, toward the Bethsaida in the southwest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mark 6:46 says, "And after He said farewell to them, He went away to the mountain to pray."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates to us how our Lord departed from His disciples and ascended to the right hand of the Father to do the work of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He left His disciples on the earth to take the journey He had assigned them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verses 47 and 48 say, "And when evening fell, the boat was in the midst of the sea and He was alone on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And seeing them distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them, He came toward them about the fourth watch of the night, walking on the sea, and He intended to pass by them."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What did the disciples encounter on this journey?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"And when evening fell."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was nightfall, and the boat was in the midst of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is the light of the world, but He has left this world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He comes again, He will be the morning star and sun.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From the ascension of Christ to His coming again, this world is in a long night.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In man's eyes, the world is becoming brighter and more progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But according to God's Word, "The night is far advanced" Rom 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God does not say that the world is very bright and progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, He says that the night is far advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are now in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why we see darkness all around us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you feel that all around you is just darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you do not know what darkness is and if you do not sense that your surroundings are all darkness, I am afraid that you have been assimilated by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we continually walk in the light and continually stay near to God, live in Christ, unceasingly judge the work of the flesh, and obey the leading of the Holy Spirit, we will surely realize that this world is indeed dark.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"The boat was in the midst of the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We still have not reached the destination of our journey.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although the matter of eternal life is resolved for us and we have no more problem with that, whether or not our history on the earth will be one of faithfulness or failure of faithfulness to the end or desertion halfway , is yet to be determined.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The boat is still in the midst of the sea and has not arrived in port.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is still the danger and possibility of changing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not be overly self-assured and should not presume that our ending is already determined.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Of course, we are delighted to be on the right course, but how we run and end it is still a question.</S>
