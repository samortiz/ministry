   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. By Obeying the Angel of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would take possession of the promised land, we must learn to obey the Angel of Jehovah, the One sent to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Angel, this sent One, is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God sent Christ to us in a way that involves many steps: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, ascension, glorification, and enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By means of all these steps, God has sent Christ, His Angel, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now that He is with us, we must obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to take possession of Christ, we need to realize that we have Him with us, even within us, as a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that we have the living Christ Himself, not a system of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This living Person is now in us Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 8:9 says, If anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not have Christ in us, we do not belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, we belong to the Devil, the demons, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Praise the Lord that Jesus Christ is in us!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have Him as the sent One, the Angel of Jehovah, who has come to us through the wonderful process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, ascension, glorification, and enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How marvelous that such a One has been sent to be with us!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians today do not realize that the living Person of Christ is with them and in them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They may care for biblical doctrines, but they may not pay attention to the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In an article entitled The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches A. W. Tozer strongly points out that believers today neglect the living Christ and His lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christians may care for their mission work, gospel preaching, or teaching of the Bible and theology, but may pay virtually no attention to the living Person of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 23:21 and 22, God does not say, I have given you teachings to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No, here the Lord says of the Angel, Take ye heed before him, and obey his voice...obey his voice, and do all that I speak lit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>. Twice we are told to obey the voice of the Angel, for His voice is God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that as the Angel, the sent One, Christ speaks for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How crucial, then, that we obey His voice!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today Christ speaks for God in a living way from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 10 there is strong emphasis on hearing the Lord s voice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Speaking of Himself as the good shepherd, the Lord Jesus says, The sheep hear his voice v. 3 . In verse 16 the Lord goes on to say, I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 27 He testifies clearly, My sheep hear My voice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have the assurance that we all have the voice of the Lord within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even the young people, those who are still teenagers, have heard the voice of the living One in them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because they hear the Lord s voice, many times it is not necessary for their parents or anyone else to tell them what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ, the living One, is more subjective to them than their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The parents of a young person cannot go to school with him, whereas the indwelling Christ not only goes with him to school, but remains in him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we have Christ, the sent One of God, within us, we must obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In particular, we should obey His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not Provoking Him</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Exodus 23:21 says, Take ye heed before him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions lit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>. Here we have four details concerning our relationship to Christ as the Angel of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These details are related to taking heed to Him, obeying Him, not provoking Him, and not being pardoned by Him of our transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is important that we listen to the Lord s voice and not provoke Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to this verse, if we provoke the Lord, He will not forgive our transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we consider this carefully, we shall see that this verse corresponds to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a very real sense, the indwelling Christ is a pleasant, gentle person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, it is rather easy for Him to be provoked by us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even if we are disobedient in a small matter, we provoke Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, we sense that He is no longer smiling upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We realize deep within that He is not happy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because the Lord within us is not happy, we cannot be happy either.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps during our time with the Lord in the Word at morning watch we are happy in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We rejoice and are full of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, later in the day we may provoke Him by our disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suddenly our joy is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fact that we are no longer happy indicates that we have provoked the Lord and that He is displeased.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He may not be angry with us, but He definitely is not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The indwelling Christ is very sensitive, and we must be careful not to provoke Him.</S>
