   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO MADE FULL AND CIRCUMCISED IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:9-12, 18, 20-22; 1 Cor 1:30; Eph 3:8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After warning us to beware that no one carries us off as spoil through philosophy and empty deceit, Paul tells us that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then in verse 10 he goes on to say, And you in Him are made full, Who is the Head of all rule and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Christ we lack nothing, for in Him we have been perfected and completed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no reason for us to turn to anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we shall see, in speaking these words Paul was dealing with the matter of angel worship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in verse 11 Paul says that we were circumcised in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be made full in Him is positive, whereas to be circumcised is to deal with something negative, in particular, the flesh, the self, and the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these things have been removed by the circumcision which is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we need to consider how in Christ, on the positive side, we have been made full and, on the negative side, we have been circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. MADE FULL IN CHRIST A. Christ as the Embodiment of All</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>the Fullness of the Godhead</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 2:9 Paul says, For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, that the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. Made Full in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ and because we have been placed in Him 1 Cor 1:30 , we have been made full in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Testament reveals clearly that all those who believe in Christ have been put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we are identified with Him and one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result is that all He is and all He has belongs to us, and all that He has experienced is our history.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We inherit all that Christ has experienced and passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, because we are one with Him, we partake of all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Marriage is an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose a poor woman marries a very rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because she is joined to her husband and identified with him, she partakes of all that he is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, we are members of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have been put into Him, identified with Him, truly married to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All that He has passed through is now our history, and all that He has obtained and attained is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are in such a Christ, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have been placed into Him, we are one with Him, and we receive all that He is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although some Christians have a doctrinal knowledge of this, a mere mental understanding of our union with Christ is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to exercise faith in order to partake of all that is ours in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not consider ourselves poor, just as a poor woman who has married a rich man should no longer think of herself as poor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even though she may feel poor, she must practice applying the fact that the riches of her husband belong to her.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In like manner, because we are one with Christ, we should not regard ourselves as in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To the contrary, we need to have a full realization of what we have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In their prayers, some Christians like to declare how poor, pitiful, and low they are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This kind of prayer is without faith or assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to believe with full assurance that we are one with the rich, all-inclusive Christ, with the One who is the embodiment of all the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we realize this with full assurance, we shall never consider ourselves poor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not believe your feelings about yourself, but look away to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Exercise your faith to realize what He is, what He has passed through, what He has obtained and attained, and where He is today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since He is in the third heaven and we are one with Him, we are in the third heaven also.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Christ we are not only millionaires we are billionaires.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have been placed into the Christ who is unsearchably rich.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this Christ we are made perfect, complete.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Him we do not lack anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not talk about how much you lack.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because you are in Christ, you lack nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Him is the fullness, the perfection, the completion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually, He Himself is the fullness, perfection, and completion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because we are in Him, we are complete and perfect; we lack nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are those who possess the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are more than billionaires because the riches we have are greater than can be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We simply have no idea what vast riches we possess in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Often we have prayed, Lord, I am poor and pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But not many have prayed in this way: Lord, I thank You that I am rich, complete, and full.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lord Jesus, because I am in You, I am richer than the wealthiest billionaire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am short of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I hope that after reading this message, you will begin to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Tell the Lord, the angels, and even the demons that you are richer than any earthly billionaire because you are in the Christ whose riches are unsearchable.</S>
