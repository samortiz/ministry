<h2 class="head2">The Unique Fellowship of the Apostles,<br />
Which Is Uniquely and Universally<br />
of All the Members of the Organic Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The intrinsic fellowship of the churches is the unique fellowship of the apostles, which is uniquely and universally of all the members of the organic Body of Christ (Acts 2:42). The flow was first the fellowship of the divine life of the divine Trinity. Then this fellowship was passed on to the apostles, who were among the first group of believers on earth. Therefore, this flow became the fellowship of the apostles. All of the early apostles were in the flow of the divine life. Furthermore, in those early days, all the believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles. There was only one teaching and one fellowship. The apostles did a wonderful work to impart the divine life into people and bring them into the flow of this divine life. This flow, this fellowship, became the new believers&rsquo; fellowship. Their fellowship was the fellowship of the apostles, and the fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Three of the Godhead are fellowshipping among Themselves. This fellowship among the Three of the Triune God is with the apostles, and it is also with us. We must realize that today in the universe, there is a flow which is just God Himself as the water of life flowing out of the Triune God through the apostles and into us. He not only flows into us, but also through us into new believers. When we preach the gospel and the ones to whom we preach receive the Lord Jesus, we are giving them an &ldquo;injection&rdquo; of the water of life. When they receive the water of life, they are brought into this wonderful fellowship.</p>
<p>We may not fully understand this fellowship, yet it is a wonderful fact. Whenever we meet a genuine believer, no matter what nationality or race he may be, something &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; within us. This experience may be compared to what happened when Mary, the mother of Jesus, went to see Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. When Elizabeth heard Mary&rsquo;s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb (Luke 1:41). Something within her was leaping. John the Baptist exulted (v. 44) upon meeting the Savior, while both of them were still in their mothers&rsquo; wombs. We may say that there was a fellowship between John the Baptist and Jesus Christ even before they were born. Today we are the &ldquo;mothers&rdquo; who have the Lord Jesus within us. When we Christians meet one another, something within us &ldquo;jumps.&rdquo; We have to go along with the &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; within us. That inward &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; is the intrinsic fellowship.</p>
<p>This intrinsic, unique fellowship is among all the members of the Body of Christ to make them one, regardless of their outward differences in race or culture. When I was a youth, the Chinese people hated the Japanese because they had invaded China. I was brought up in that atmosphere, but the Lord saved me, and in 1933 I was called by the Lord to quit my job and serve Him full-time. The same day that I dropped my job, I received an invitation from Manchuria, inviting me to speak. While I was speaking there, some Japanese believers came to me, told me that they were Christians, and invited me to come to their place to share with them. I went to their place and met with them according to their custom. Even though I had grown up in an atmosphere in which there was much hatred for the Japanese people, something was &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; within me as I met with them because they were my Christian brothers. I loved them, and I was so happy to meet with them. My love for them was something in the flow of the divine life, the fellowship, within me.</p>
<p>If we follow the intrinsic fellowship, there will be no problems between us. When we are centered on the outward things, trouble comes. In some places in the United States, the white people and the black people would not meet together to worship the Lord. This is because of their centering on outward things rather than on the intrinsic fellowship. Problems among the saints are also due to focusing on something outward rather than on the intrinsic fellowship of life.</p>
<p>Christians love one another until they focus on outward things such as what group they meet with or what doctrines they agree on. One Christian may believe in pre-tribulation rapture, while another believes in post-tribulation rapture. They may argue and fight over their doctrinal disagreements. As long as we are centered on doctrines, there will be division. There are many doctrines, but there is only one intrinsic fellowship. If we only care for the intrinsic fellowship, the flow of the divine life, which is like the blood circulation in our body, we will be fine. We must limit ourselves to the flow, the fellowship of the divine life. We should live in and care for this intrinsic fellowship, which is of the Triune God, of the apostles, and of all the believers.</p>
