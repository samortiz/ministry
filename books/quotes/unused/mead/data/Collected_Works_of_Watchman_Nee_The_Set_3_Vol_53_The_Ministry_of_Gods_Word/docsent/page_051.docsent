   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL THINGS BEING NURTURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you receive your basic revelation for the first time, you realize that the Bible is living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, you may see that Christ is your holiness, with emphasis on the word is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is your holiness; it is not a matter of Christ making you holy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not Christ giving you His holiness but Christ becoming your holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your eyes are opened to see that your holiness is not a work but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your holiness is a person, just as your righteousness is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your righteousness is not the sum of fifty or more things that you do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has made Christ your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your righteousness is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a basic revelation: Christ is your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is your holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your righteousness is a person, and your holiness is also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a glorious vision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After two months an occasion may arise for you to take up the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to tell the brothers and sisters that Christ is your holiness, and you have to show them the difference between holiness as a thing and holiness as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, you must remember that you cannot count on the revelation you received two months ago.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You need to ask the Lord again, "Lord, what should I say?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only after the Lord has shown you the need to speak such a word will you have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every time God wants you to speak such a word, He has to shine once again upon the revelation you received.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have to see the same thing all over again, and you have to see it like you have never seen it before.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It has to become something new in you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are enlightened within, and you see the meaning of Christ as your holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When this happens, you can go to the brothers and sisters and preach to them about Christ as holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is a revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A revelation is a seeing of what is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible is full of Christ, and revelation enables us to see all the things that are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is our holiness; this is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the first time we see it, it is new to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a man sees something by revelation, it is brand new; nothing in the world seems as new as it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It becomes vibrant with the power of life; it is fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation is always new; it makes old things new.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We wish to point this out: Revelation not only makes the letters living, turning old things into new things and converting what is objective into something subjective; it actually makes the subjective things altogether new once more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A basic revelation turns all the objective things in Christ into subjective things in man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before a man receives such a basic revelation, everything in Christ is objective to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once he receives such a revelation, all the objective things become subjective to him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this does not mean that once this word is opened up, the job is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It does not mean that this one opening will supply a man with what he needs for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if we have received a revelation, we need a fresh revelation from God every time we minister the word and serve others with Christ so that the old things can once again be new.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must remember that spiritual things have to be nurtured in the environment of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God intends that all the things of Christ and concerning Christ be living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He intends that all these things be nurtured through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His revelation can make the old things continually living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the things of Christ have to be kept alive continually by revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once revelation is removed, spiritual things no longer are living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may think that you saw something in the past and that this vision qualifies you to say something today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But you will find out that you cannot give anything to others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The same is true with preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is easy to remember that the Lord is the Savior and that your sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes you touch something when you preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At other times, the more you speak, the less boldness you have; you feel like a dried-up bottle of glue.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Clearly one speaking is with revelation, whereas the other is without revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only things that are kept in the realm of revelation are living, fresh, powerful, and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must bear in mind that all spiritual things become dead the minute they are separated from revelation.</S>
