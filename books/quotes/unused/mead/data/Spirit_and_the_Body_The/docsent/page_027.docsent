   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE ANOINTING, THE SEALING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE EARNEST, AND THE FIRSTFRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider some symbols of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second Corinthians 1:21 and 22 say, "Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed one and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the foretaste of the Spirit in our hearts" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. In these verses we see the Spirit as the anointing, as the seal, and as the earnest or the foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 8:23 speaks of the firstfruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we would know the riches of the all-inclusive Spirit, we must know how to interpret these symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to allegorize the figures used in the New Testament to portray this rich Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, "Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed one, and hath anointed us, is God."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The "us" refers to the Apostles, and the "you" denotes the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has attached the Apostles and the believers unto the anointed One, who is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the ointment has been poured upon this unique anointed One, and from Him the ointment runs down to all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we were not attached to this anointed One, we would not have any ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the ointment has been poured upon the anointed One, and since we are attached to this anointed One, the ointment runs down to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is difficult to explain anything related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Life is mysterious and difficult to understand, but easy to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all have a wonderful physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without this physical life, I could not stand here and speak to you in such a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But who understands our physical life?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not even the medical doctors understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we do not understand it, we experience it every day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even ignorant babies experience it from the moment they are born.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ has been anointed by God Heb 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, He is the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since we believe in Him and partake of Him, we participate in His anointing, sharing the same ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, we are firmly attached to Him, the anointed One, enjoying His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you call, "O Lord Jesus," do you not sense the anointing within you?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that you are firmly attached to the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is something within you anointing you all the time, flowing and even running throughout your inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the moving of the ointment that is upon the Head running down to reach you as one of His members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It runs down to water you, to saturate you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, you can no longer be a dry member; rather, you are one always under the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This anointing adds to us the very essence of God, the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is similar to the process of painting a table.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As you paint the table, the element of the paint is added to the table.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, as the ointment runs through us, it brings the divine element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Lord's recovery we have the assurance that day by day something is running through us, doing an inward "painting" work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more this ointment moves, the more it paints us with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hallelujah, the divine element is being added to us in the Lord's recovery!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not a matter of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Something is running over us and through us, and the divine element is being accumulated within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we enjoy the flowing of the inner life and the more we enjoy the Lord together in the meetings, the more we have God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although we may still feel that we are weak, we nevertheless have God within, for the anointing is constantly adding the divine element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a strong sign that the Lord's recovery is different from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may stay in religion for years without receiving anything of the divine element into you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, simply by being in the Lord's recovery for several months, you will be able to testify that God has been painted into you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not simply a matter of acquiring the knowledge of God, but it is a matter of having the element of God added into your being by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Oh, the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound ointment, is anointing us all day long!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have a divine paint, the compound ointment, the all-inclusive Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, who is painting us day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all have had some amount of the divine element added into our being.</S>
