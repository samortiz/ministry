   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In dealing with humankind, God deals with only two races.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These are the Adamic race, the race created by God, and the Abrahamic race, the race chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first ten and a half chapters of Genesis are concerned with the Adamic race, the created race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This race failed God to the uttermost at Babel, where, in union with Satan to frustrate the divine economy, they rebelled against God, exalted themselves, and worshipped idols.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then God came in to select a person by the name of Abraham and decided to make his descendants a new race, the chosen race.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The entire Bible from the second half of Genesis 11 to the end of the New Testament is occupied with this elect race.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With both the created race and the chosen race, God suffered a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Adamic race failed Him, and the Abrahamic race also failed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we read through the Old Testament to the end, we see that the children of Israel, the race of Abraham, utterly failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, the Old Testament ends not with disappointment but with expectation, for the godly ones among the chosen race were eagerly expecting the Messiah and were looking forward to receiving him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the Old Testament ends with the expectation that the Messiah, the unique one, would come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whereas the Old Testament ends with an expectation, the New Testament begins with a genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Matthew 1:1 says, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 2 goes on to say that Abraham begot Isaac, that Isaac begot Jacob, and that Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This genealogy continues until it arrives at a unique person: the One who in the Old Testament is called Messiah and in the New Testament is called Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 17 concludes, "Thus all the generations...until the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the generations of the Abrahamic race were directed to Christ and brought in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations; as such, He fulfills their prophecies, solves their problems, and meets their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From this point on, the whole New Testament is a full expounding of this wonderful Christ, who is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hallelujah, Christ has come!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning of the New Testament, we have a new race with a new center, and this center is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With Him we have the divine economy, the divine dispensing, and the unsearchable riches Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ comes, all manner of positive things come with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The list of these things is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The list of what came with Christ even includes us who believe in Christ, for as believers we are descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God selected Abraham, He decided to give him two kinds of descendants the physical descendants and the spiritual descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abraham's physical descendants are the physical Israel, and his spiritual descendants are the spiritual Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament deals mainly not with the physical Israel but with the spiritual Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order that we may have full confidence concerning this, let us now consider some verses from the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Galatians 3:8 says, "The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: In you shall all the nations be blessed.'"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here Paul does not say that God would justify the Jews; he says that God would justify the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But then he tells us that the gospel was announced not to the Gentiles but to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God announced to Abraham the gospel concerning the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that the Gentiles would be included among the spiritual descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 9 continues, "So then they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we are of faith, and we are blessed with believing Abraham because we are his spiritual descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verses 13 and 14 Paul goes on to say, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is every one hanging on a tree'; in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is the blessing that God promised to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is the Spirit, the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit is the blessing of the gospel preached to us.</S>
