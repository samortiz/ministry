<h2 class="head3">8. Unique Foundation of God&rsquo;s Building</h2><p>In 3:11 Paul says, &ldquo;For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.&rdquo; As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church (Matt. 16:16-18). No one can lay any other foundation.</p><h2 class="head3">9. Passover</h2><p>In 5:7 Paul says, &ldquo;For indeed our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.&rdquo; To say that Christ is our Passover means not only that He is the Passover lamb, but also the entire Passover.</p><h2 class="head3">10. Unleavened Bread</h2><p>In 5:8 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Let us therefore keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&rdquo; Christ Himself is this unleavened bread.</p><h2 class="head3">11. Spiritual Food</h2><p>First Corinthians 10:3 says, &ldquo;And all ate the same spiritual food.&rdquo; Christ is the spiritual food as our daily life supply.</p><h2 class="head3">12. Spiritual Drink</h2><p>In 10:4 Paul says, &ldquo;And all drank the same spiritual drink.&rdquo; Christ today is our spiritual drink.</p><h2 class="head3">13. Spiritual Rock</h2><p>In 10:4 Paul also says, &ldquo;They drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; The rock smitten in Exodus 17:6 is a type of Christ smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life and to satisfy our thirst (John 19:34).</p><h2 class="head3">14. Head</h2><p>In 11:3 we see that Christ is the Head. He is the Head of every man.</p><h2 class="head3">15. The Body</h2><p>According to 12:12, Christ is also the Body. This means that He is not only the Head, but that He is constituted in us to actually become us. Hence, He is both the Head and the Body. It is difficult to explain how Christ can be the Body. Nevertheless, the Bible reveals this, and we believe it.</p><h2 class="head3">16. Firstfruit</h2><p>In 15:20 Paul says, &ldquo;But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruit of them that are asleep.&rdquo; In verse 23 he again refers to &ldquo;Christ the firstfruit.&rdquo; Thus, Christ Himself is the firstfruit.</p><h2 class="head3">17. The Second Man</h2><p>In 15:47 Paul speaks of the second man. This second man is also Christ.</p> <h2 class="head3">18. The Last Adam</h2><p>In 15:45 Paul refers to Christ as the last Adam.
