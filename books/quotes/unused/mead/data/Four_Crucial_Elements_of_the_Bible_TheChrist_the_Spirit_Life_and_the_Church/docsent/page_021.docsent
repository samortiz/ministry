   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Living the God-man Life by the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus began to minister at the age of thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As soon as He was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, that is, was poured upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may use the baking of cakes for the meal offering as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In some cases, the oil was poured upon the cakes; in other cases, the oil was first mingled with the fine flour to make the cakes, and then the oil was poured upon them Lev 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John the Baptist may be likened to the former, and the Lord Jesus to the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John merely had the Holy Spirit poured upon him as his power; he did not have the divine nature in him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus, however, was conceived of the Holy Spirit; such a conception was essential and was related to the divine being of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Holy Spirit accomplished the mingling of divinity and humanity in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The essence of the Holy Spirit's divine element was unchangeable and irremovable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus at His baptism as His power for His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This power could be removed from Him when there was the need for it Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, when He came out to minister, He not only had the Holy Spirit outwardly as power, but He already had the Holy Spirit in Him as the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot compare with the Lord Jesus even in His human nature, not to mention that the divine nature was in His human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why we stress repeatedly that the vocabulary of the human race cannot adequately describe the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In human history and culture there has never been another one like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was most extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition to His sweet humanity, He possessed divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was like a great magnet attracting people to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the seashore of the Sea of Galilee, seeing Peter, Andrew, James, and John, He spoke only a brief word: "Come after Me."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And they immediately quit their fishing, cast off their nets, and left their boats and their fathers to follow Him Matt 4:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many of us have also been attracted by Him and therefore follow Him willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Bringing Humanity into Divinity and Being Glorified to Become the Spirit through His Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day, on the last day of the Jews' Feast of Tabernacles, the great day of their feast, this One who was God mingled with man stood up and cried out, saying, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink" John 7:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may not marvel at such a word at first, but after some careful consideration, we may wonder what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Confucius could not say and dared not to say, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet the Lord Jesus called people to come to Him and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If someone who was thirsty came to Him, what kind of drink would He give him?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How would He quench his thirst?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the Lord Jesus explained, saying, "He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" v. 38 . This indicates that to come to Him and drink is to believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we believe into Him, not only is our thirst quenched, but there are even rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus is attractive to us because He can quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He gives us the living water when we come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once we drink this water, we are glad and are beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, we even have living water flowing out of our innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is truly a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The apostle John told us, "But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive" v. 39a . We know the Spirit of God, we can understand the Spirit of Jehovah, and we know a little concerning the Holy Spirit, but what is "the Spirit" referred to here? In Greek, there is a great emphasis in using the definite article.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The presence of the article the before Spirit is emphatic in Greek, indicating that the Spirit referred to is a very particular Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is "the Spirit"?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John went on to say, "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified" v. 39b . We have seen that the conception of the Lord Jesus was the issue of the Holy Spirit's entering into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, at that time the Holy Spirit was already there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But at the time the Lord Jesus spoke this word, "the Spirit" was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, in order to know what "the Spirit" is, we must first find out when the Lord Jesus was glorified and what the issue of His glorification was.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to John's writing, the Lord Jesus was God incarnated to be a man 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was the God-man living the human life on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then He went to the cross and was crucified for us, shedding His blood for our redemption and releasing His divine life 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After three days He was resurrected from death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His resurrection was His glorification Luke 24:26; 1 Cor 15:43a .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one may be able to recognize the seed of a flowering plant, but when it is sown into the soil, it sprouts, grows, and blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the seed's being glorified and thereby being manifested to people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus was such a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was man, yet He had God in Him; He was God who became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His human living was incomprehensible to the Jews John 10:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even those in His family could not fully understand Him; they were only able to tell that He was subject to them Luke 2:48-51 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When He came out to preach in His ministry at the age of thirty, He attracted a group of people, especially the twelve disciples, to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The twelve disciples were attracted by Him, and they followed Him daily, yet they did not know Him that well Matt 8:23-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They only knew that it was truly wonderful to follow Him, and they expected that for their whole life they would follow this Jesus who was in the flesh.</S>
