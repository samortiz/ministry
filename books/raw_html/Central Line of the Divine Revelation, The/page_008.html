<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Christ</H2><P>Christ, in Greek Christos (Matt. 1:16b), equals Messiah in Hebrew (John 1:41; Dan. 9:26). Both of these terms mean the anointed One (Psa. 2:2). Christ is God's anointed One. Christ is a title of commission. To be anointed means to be appointed by God to be His Christ, to be His anointed One, for the accomplishing of His eternal economy (Luke 4:18-19). The anointed One of God accomplishes God's economy in His salvation. In the New Testament the two titles, Jesus and Christ, are often used as a compound title, either Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus (Matt. 1:1b, 18a; 1 Tim. 1:15-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Holy Spirit</H2><P>The divine title Holy Spirit, meaning the Spirit who is holy, refers to the Spirit of God, who is God and the Lord Himself. Acts 5:3-4 and 9 show this. In verse 3 Peter told Ananias that he lied to the Holy Spirit. In verse 4 he said that Ananias lied to God. Then in verse 9 he told Sapphira that she and Ananias tested the Spirit of the Lord. This indicates that the Holy Spirit is both God and the Lord.</P><P>I hope that this simple study of the divine titles will help us. We should do our best to remember these primary divine titles of God. The New Testament also speaks of the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus is mentioned in Acts 16:7, the Spirit of Christ is mentioned in Romans 8:9, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is seen in Philippians 1:19. The Spirit of Jesus refers to Jesus as the One who suffered, the Spirit of Christ indicates that Jesus is the One in resurrection, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ indicates that the Lord is the One who suffered and who is now in resurrection. The divine titles in the Bible are very meaningful. In order to know our God, we need to know His divine titles. Our God is not that simple. He is Elohim, Jehovah, Adonai, God, Father, Lord, Jesus, Christ, and the Holy Spirit.</P>
