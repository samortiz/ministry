   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Africa</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Africa the Lord s testimony began in Ghana.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ghana is on the west coast of Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was called Gold Coast when it was a British colony, and it became the Republic of Ghana when it gained its independence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s testimony in Africa also began through our publications in English.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From Ghana the Lord s recovery went to Nigeria.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nigeria is the largest country in West Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Its capital, Lagos, has nine million people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is a church there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is also a church in North Africa, in Libya.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In recent years the Lord s recovery has also gone to the Republic of South Africa, which is on the southernmost tip of Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Due to amendments in their constitution, Chinese people there enjoy the same rights and privileges as the Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are three churches in South Africa, two of which are in the capital Pretoria and in Cape Town.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is also a church in Zimbabwe, which is a country to the northeast of South Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not long ago they sent me a letter asking for permission to translate the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They also want us to supply them with our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These African countries are economically weak, so we have been supplying them with free publications for the past few years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To date we have supplied books and tapes worth over fifty thousand U.S. dollars to Ghana alone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The situation in these countries is encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The testimonies in these countries were not raised up by our going there; they were raised up by the publications.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After being helped by the publications, some of the believers attended the trainings in America.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Afterward, they returned to their country to raise up the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Australia</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we speak of Australia, we are including New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The situation in these countries is very encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are three or four churches in Australia, including churches in Sydney and Melbourne.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are approximately ten churches in New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We thank the Lord that the churches in the Lord s recovery are now in all five continents in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Asia</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord s recovery has been in China for more than sixty years, but there was nothing happening in India or Burma Myanmar .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many years ago some saints moved to the island of Ceylon, but the situation was not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, over the past year or two the Lord has been working in India and Burma.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first church has been established in Burma, and the church in Bangkok, Thailand has been in contact with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is also a local Burmese young man who has been in contact with us by letter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His written English is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In his letters he told us that there are approximately nineteen groups meeting in Burma.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are not very clear concerning the way of the church, but he said that they receive much help when they read the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have requested permission to translate all the Life-study messages into Burmese.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said that he is a young person who loves the Lord and is pursuing theology.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We believe that in the future he will be brought into this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have also received a letter from another believer; based on his writing, use of words, and his name, he is probably a missionary from England.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He said that they have several meeting places and several Bible-study groups.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since he has received much help from reading the Life-study messages, he wants to use the Life-study messages to supply the needs of their Bible studies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He asked for permission to use and translate these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These are two good situations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the southern part of India there is a brother who is a high school teacher, and he is about forty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He began to fellowship with us because of our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has lived in America for approximately one year.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After this year s winter training, he will return to southern India and begin the church life there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope that we will all pray for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In recent years I have been receiving letters from believers in many countries telling me how much help they have received from the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have saved all these letters, and I hope that one day the letters will be printed in a book entitled Letters of Appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE LORD S WORK IN TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some brothers and sisters are ready to go to Italy and India, and there are other brothers and sisters who want to go to Africa, Australia, and northern Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every move involves specific steps, just as every military attack must have a strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fighting a war requires not only skills but also strategies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One must not move too quickly; a desire to do something quickly prevents a person from being thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I look to the Lord s Spirit to work in you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have been living in the English-speaking world for more than twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>During this time I have visited Sydney and Melbourne in Australia as well as several cities in New Zealand; I have also traveled to Europe and to South America.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have a clear understanding of the situation in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From my observation of their situation, I feel that the churches in Taiwan have the most potential, because they have a history of more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During these more than thirty years, the Lord has truly blessed Taiwan and made it peaceful and secure.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The most necessary thing for the gospel work is a secure environment as well as a well-educated population.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then when the Lord s recovery comes with the gospel and the truth, it will be easy to catch fish.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During the first six or seven years, our numbers increased one hundredfold, from five hundred to fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Later our increase was interrupted because too much emphasis was placed on spiritual pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The thirty-five years of our history in Taiwan can be divided into five seven-year periods.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>During the first seven years, the number of saints increased from five hundred to fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Due to the interruption, we no longer had a definite direction.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, we have not increased in numbers for the past twenty-eight years, or the past four seven-year periods.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At present, there are only forty-five to fifty thousand brothers and sisters in all of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A certain group in Hong Kong put out a book with statistics.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This book said that in Taiwan the Presbyterian denomination has the largest number of Christians; it has more than eighty thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The second largest group is the Local Church, with forty-five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The third largest group is the True Jesus Church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This group is mainly in the mountainous areas and has more than twenty thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our numbers are low because for the last twenty-eight years our work has mainly been to stabilize and maintain; we did not do a work of spreading as we did in the first seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Of course, we must thank the Lord for the stability of our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We confess that we have many weaknesses and shortcomings, but our situation is better than the situation of other Christians groups.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have been equipping many saints for more than ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When I returned to Taiwan in 1966, many of the young people wanted to serve the Lord full time, and they wrote down their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>That was eighteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We still have their consecrations.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I believe that more than one thousand saints consecrated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What they wrote was a contract with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, as one who represents the Lord, I have come to tell you that it is time for you to fulfill your contract.</S>
