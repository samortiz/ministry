In his statement Witness Lee cites several reputable authorities including Andrew Murray, Griffith Thomas, and J
These booklets were evidently ignored by the authors of The New Cults, who reprinted their same accusations in subsequent publications
A number of their publications are still being circulated today by the Christian Research Institute and others
In the first booklet Brother Lee gave a balanced scriptural definition of the Triune God by citing the Bible's own words
One of the critics, Walter Martin, frustrated by his traditional understanding, considered this 'confusing of the persons of the Trinity'
In the second booklet Brother Lee focused upon the problems caused by forcing Scripture into traditional understanding
Witness Lee examined in detail the crucial passages of Scripture such as Isaiah 9:6, 1 Corinthians 15:45, and 2 Corinthians 3:17
To date, none of the critics have issued one effectual argument to clear themselves of Witness Lee's charge of heresy
Brother Lee concluded the first booklet, 'The Triune God cannot be fully comprehended as a doctrinal matter by our limited mentality
God as a Trinity is for His economy, that is, for the dispensing of Himself into us to be our life and our everything'
Because the first occurrence of the word God in the Bible is in the plural number, some people translate it as 'Gods'
If you consult the markings in the Newberry Bible, you will find there an indication that 'God' here is triple in number
Perhaps some will ask, 'If you say that God is only one, how could God in Genesis 1:26 refer to Himself as 'Us' and speak of 'Our' image?
In John 17:11 the Lord prayed, 'Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are'
In verse 3 Peter told Ananias that he had lied to the Holy Spirit, and in the next verse that he had lied to God
Let everyone know that in accordance with the Bible, we declare that all Three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are eternal
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
Are mentioned the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship or communion of the Holy Spirit
If you believe that the child born to us is the Mighty God, you have to believe also that the Son given to us is the everlasting Father
The following is a quotation taped at a meeting of some people who were discussing how to deal with our so-called heresy
Perhaps even some of you reading this message held such a concept in the past but were afraid to speak of it for fear of being condemned
Since theologians could not reconcile this matter, they came up with the term persons, speaking of the three persons of the Godhead
To stress the Father, Son, and Spirit as three individual 'persons' is to go beyond the revelation of the Bible
Griffith Thomas, author of a well-known exposition on Romans, made this comment: 'The term 'Person' is also sometimes objected to
By the clause, 'the Word was with God,' we understand that the Word and God are two, for the Word was with God
God as a Trinity is for His economy, that is, for the dispensing of Himself into us to be our life and our everything
It is the experience of the Christian life that the work of the Spirit and the work of the Risen Lord are one and the same
When it comes to the matter of the Triune God, many Christians only care for their tradition, not for the clear, accurate word of the Bible
In order to preserve their tradition, they twist the words of Scripture and will not return absolutely to the pure word of the Bible
It may be that they are not aware of this or that they hold it unconsciously and, thus, they may deny that they hold it
The concept held by them actually is heretical because it implies two divine Fathers two lifegiving Spirits and in some cases three Gods
In today's Christianity we see neither the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ nor the practice of the proper church life
Throughout the years that we have been burdened by the Lord with His recovery, we have been attacked by religion
Undoubtedly, He is the Lamb of God and the Redeemer, but these are simply two aspects of this all-inclusive One
Our critics say that we teach heresy in telling people that Christ, the Son, is the Father as well as the Spirit
The Father, the Spirit, and the Son are not only present after Christ's resurrection, but even after His ascension and after Pentecost
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
Modalism teaches that God is not at the same time Father and Son and that the revelation of the Son ended with the ascension
Some of the critics, however, may reply, 'Don't you say that the Son is the Father and that Christ is the Spirit?
Throughout the centuries, all fundamental students of the Bible have agreed that the child born in the manger was the Mighty God
In the middle of the verse it says that He is the One who carries out God's administration, for 'the government shall be upon his shoulder'
The first twisting is exemplified by a brother who said, 'The Son is called the Father, but He is not the Father'
They say that He is another Father, the Father of eternity, which, according to them, means the origin, the source, of the ages
If anyone says that this Father, the Father of Israel, is not the Father in the Godhead, he implies that there are two divine Fathers
Some say that, based on this, the everlasting Father in Isaiah 9:6 is not the Father in the Godhead, but the Father of the coming age
They claim that He is the Father who brings in the new age, just as Edison was the Father who brought in the age of electrical science
Not only is the 'child,' the 'son,' for our personal experience, but also all that His five names unfold is for our personal experience
Christ as the wonderful One, the Counselor, the Mighty God, and the Prince of Peace is all for our personal experience
Since the wonderful One, the Counselor, the Mighty God, and the Prince of Peace are ours, the everlasting Father must also be ours
Isaiah 64:8 says, 'O Lord, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand'
In 648 Isaiah tells us that the Father of eternity in 96 is our Creator and in 6316 he tells us that the Father of eternity is our Redeemer
the everlasting Father' in Isaiah 9:6, regardless of how people twist it, must be the unique divine Father in the Godhead
If 'the Mighty God' should not be twisted, then neither should 'the everlasting Father' be twisted, for this is against the principle
Isaiah 9:6 says that the child born unto us is called the Mighty God, and we believe that the child is the Mighty God
It is heretical to say that besides the divine Father in the Godhead there is another divine Father of creation or of the age to come
Whether the article is definite or indefinite, the last Adam, who is Christ Himself, became a Spirit, a life-giving Spirit
Eventually, He indicated that in order to be life to people as the bread of life, He must be the Spirit, for it is the Spirit who gives life
Or, to put the matter another way, do you believe that besides the Spirit of Christ there is another Spirit called the Holy Spirit?
The critics apparently do not know that the Holy Spirit today is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Christ
A number of Christian writers, including Dean Alford and Andrew Murray, have said that the Lord is Jesus and that the Lord is the Spirit
In the book of 2 Corinthians the title the Lord is always attached to the Lord Jesus and God is called the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
They believe the Bible in their twisting way; we believe the Bible in the way of taking whatever it says in black and white
To him, They were merely three manifestations of the one God who manifests Himself in different ways according to circumstances
Because the tritheists hold the side of the three and neglect the side of the one, they also have no balance or safeguard
As we have pointed out, we also believe verses such as Matthew 3:16-17, 2 Corinthians 13:14, Revelation 1:4-5, and Ephesians 3:14-17
In the Bible, the revelation of the Triune God is related to His relationship with man and to man's experience of Him
The first time the three of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are revealed is in Matthew 28:19
Many terms have been invented or adopted by theologians related to the Trinity: person, substance, hypostasis, subsistence, etc
Had you ever heard that for Christ to be experienced by us as the all-inclusive One, He must be the life-giving Spirit?
Had you ever heard that the Triune God is for the dispensing of Himself into us, His chosen people, for our experience?
Years ago, the Lord enlightened us and revealed these things to us, and we have been practicing them for a long time
If we try to understand the Triune God as a doctrine and neglect experience, we shall find ourselves in difficulty
When you exercise your mind to talk about Them, They are three, but when you exercise your spirit to experience Them, They are just one
We must believe the clear Word in a pure way, saying, 'Amen,' to whatever the Bible says, and we should take care of our experience
