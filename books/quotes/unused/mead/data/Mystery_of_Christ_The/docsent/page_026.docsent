   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MINISTRY IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:4-31 SEEING THE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Christian must see not only that he is a believer but also that he is a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since he is a member, he needs other members.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is impossible for one member to live without other members.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for a member to survive, he needs to have other members.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people leave the denominations because they realize that denominationalism is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this is not enough; they must go on to see the Body and get into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is not a denominational organization; the church is the living Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A Christian is not a member of a denomination but a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to see that we are members in the Body and that we cannot be separated from other members.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot be independent, and we cannot go on without the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE MINISTRY OF THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Body of Christ is built up by the mutual supply of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition to seeing that we are members, we have to see that every member has a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every member in the Body has a special function, and that function is its ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The verb form of the word ministry means "to serve."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ministry of a member is the special portion that a member receives from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With this special portion he supplies the Body, and this is the service of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Body is Christ, so our ministry is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everyone who belongs to the Lord has a special portion which he has received from Christ, and each portion has its characteristic feature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This feature becomes the special characteristic of his service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ministerial service to others is based on the Christ one has within him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One does not serve others with the doctrine that he understands; he can only supply the Body with what he has received of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The measure of our ministry is determined by the measure of Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our ministry is based on these two factors: the Christ we have gained and the aspects of Christ that we have gained which are different from what other members have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we only knew Christ in the same general way, what would there be for us to minister to one another?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What would we have that would enable us to build up the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is the most basic consideration in all ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A Christian needs a ministry that is particularly his, not just a general ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must gain something of Christ that others have not gained.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is this particular gain that enables us to make up that which is lacking in other members.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ministry involves a special knowledge of Christ; it is not a general knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every organ in the body has its special function.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The eyes see, the ears hear, and the nose smells.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every organ has its special function.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, every organ has its special portion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Other organs may temporarily do what another member does, but they are not dedicated to that particular function.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, you can sometimes use your mouth to pick up things, but you cannot dedicate the mouth to this use.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the ears do not function according to their particular capacity, the body will not hear anything, and the growth of the body will be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you have acquired something special and have some special knowledge of the Lord, you can supply the Body with it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you have a special knowledge of the Lord, this special knowledge will constitute your specific ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only specific ministries can serve the Body and cause the Body to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why every member has to continually seek and gain from the Lord what the Body does not have and convey it to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When every member fulfills its ministry, there will be growth in the Body of Christ.</S>
