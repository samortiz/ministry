   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FOOD OF GOD'S PEOPLE Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>7 and 8 Scripture Reading: Exo 12:8-9; 16:2-4, 14-16; 17:1-7; Num 11:5-6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we will speak on the food of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Exodus we see three kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is the meat of the lamb, described in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second is the manna in chapter sixteen, and the third is the water that flowed out of the rock in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All these are the food that God prepared for the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No item could be missing from this provision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there had been only the meat of the lamb without the manna and the water, it would not have been sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there had been the manna without the water, it would not have been sufficient either.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There first had to be the meat of the lamb and then the manna plus the water before the Israelites could be led out of Egypt, pass through the wilderness, and enter into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE MEAT OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us first consider the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible clearly tells us that the lamb refers to our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Israelites not only put the blood of the lamb on the doorposts; they had to eat the meat of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only did they trust in the lamb to bear their sins and deliver them from perdition, they had to receive it into them for their strength.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason, we must not only believe in the Lord; we must also receive Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Israelites not only trusted in the blood of the lamb for the passing over of the destroyer's sword, but they ate the meat for their strength so that they could leave Egypt in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some have believed in the Lord and received forgiveness of sins, but they do not have the strength to renounce the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reason for this is that they have not eaten the meat in their heart yet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The blood has been applied, but they do not have the strength to leave Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, in order to take our journey and obey the Lord, we need the meat, not the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Exodus 12:8 indicates that the meat of the lamb had to be eaten on the same night.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although this was a commandment, the experience of many people is exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you ask someone if he has believed in the Lord and if his sins are forgiven, he may give you a very clear and eloquent answer about the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if you ask why he still loves the world so much, he will say that he does not have the strength to give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The world does not have to be something big.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The extent of the world which we love and hold onto may be very small; it may be only a few dollars, or a few persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is this way because he did not eat the meat in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible tells us that the meat had to be eaten the same night.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way to be delivered from the bondage of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eating the meat means to receive the Lord Jesus into our heart to be our Savior so that we can experience freedom in our practical daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Comments that are similar to the following often can be heard: "Why does So-and-so have such a holy living since he believed in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why has there been so much change in him?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have believed in the Lord Jesus also.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why do I still love the world so much and find it so difficult to give it up?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we see that in order for a believer to be delivered from the world, it is a matter of eating the meat, not of applying the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All believers have experienced the application of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any difference between Christians is the result of whether or not they have eaten the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have covered the need to eat the meat, but how do we eat the meat?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second part of verse 8 speaks of eating the meat with two things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first is bitter herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Bitter is not the name of an herb; it refers to the taste of the herb.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Any herb, as long as it is bitter, can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The meaning of bitterness is hatred and displeasure in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Spiritually speaking, it means to repent of past sins and mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Repentance in the Bible carries only the sense of regret; it does not carry the sense of reform.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is better to understand it as a regret over past errors.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The second thing we need is unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First Corinthians tells us the meaning of the unleavened bread; it means the removal of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, we have to regret our past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the other hand, we have to repudiate our present sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No one who has the strength can excuse himself from forsaking sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No one can hold onto sin with one hand, and hold onto God with the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who have Egypt in their heart cannot leave Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Regretting past mistakes means to remove the past errors.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do not remove the leaven, we cannot leave Egypt even if we eat the meat of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have often said something wrong, and our heart feels condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At these times Satan says, "Help me a little!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Just be wrong all the way to the end!"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, we should say that we would rather stand on God's side, and that we will not be Satan's companion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We would rather "lose our face" and tell those whom we have offended, "I have just said something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Please do not take heart in that word."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some may say that it is meaningless to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But this is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have done this kind of thing many times.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For our past we need bitter herbs, and for our future we need unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These qualify us to eat the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many people do not grow spiritually because they are running around in circles like horses in a race.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It seems that they have traveled a long way, but actually they remain in the same place because they are not willing to regret and remove their past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whoever does not want to remove their past sins cannot go on, and whoever keeps their sins will never grow.</S>
