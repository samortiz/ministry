 <h2 class="head1">II. EXAMPLES OF EARLY RISING</h2>
<p>In the Bible we find God&rsquo;s servants rising up early in the morning. Let us consider their examples:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Abraham&mdash;Gen. 19:27; 21:14; 22:3</li>
<li>Jacob&mdash;Gen. 28:18</li>
<li>Moses&mdash;Exo. 8:20; 9:13; 24:4; 34:4</li>
<li>Joshua&mdash;Josh. 3:1; 6:12; 7:16; 8:10</li>
<li>Gideon&mdash;Judg. 6:38</li>
<li>Hannah&mdash;1 Sam. 1:19</li>
<li>Samuel&mdash;1 Sam. 15:12</li>
<li>David&mdash;1 Sam. 17:20</li>
<li>Job&mdash;Job 1:5</li>
<li>Mary&mdash;Luke 24:22; Mark 16:9; John 20:1</li>
<li>The apostles&mdash;Acts 5:21</li>
</ol>
<p>These many verses tell us that God&rsquo;s servants had the habit of dealing with God early in the morning. Every one of them had the habit of waking early in the morning and fellowshipping with God early in the morning. They rose up early in the morning to do many things related to God&rsquo;s business. They also rose up early in the morning to consecrate themselves. Although there is no commandment in the Bible that tells us to get up early, there are sufficient examples in the Bible to show us that all faithful servants of God rise up early. Even the Lord Jesus Himself rose up early. He rose up very early in the morning, while it was still night, and went away to a deserted place to pray (Mark 1:35). When He wanted to appoint the twelve apostles, He called them to Himself early in the morning (Luke 6:13). If the Lord had to rise up early to do these things, how much more do we need to rise up early?</p>
<p>Any brother or sister who wants to follow the Lord must never think that there is little difference in rising up an hour early. You must realize that your Bible reading becomes ineffective if you rise up an hour late. Likewise, your prayer becomes ineffective if you rise up an hour late. Although one may spend the same amount of time in reading the Bible, an hour&rsquo;s difference will produce very different results. Early rising brings in great blessing. We hope that you will not miss the blessing of early rising at the start of your Christian life. One brother was asked at least fifty times during his first three years as a Christian, &ldquo;What time did you get up this morning?&rdquo; Early rising is a great blessing. Those who have learned to rise up early know the significance of it. If you do not rise up early in the morning, you will live in spiritual poverty. Late rising brings in much loss. Many spiritual things are lost through late rising.</p>
<p>We have seen many examples from the Bible. How about the servants of God who are not mentioned in the Bible, like George M&#252;ller, John Wesley, and many other famous servants of God? They also rose up early in the morning. We can say that almost all the ones we know of or have read about from books, who are of any use in God&rsquo;s hands, pay attention to the matter of rising early. They call this early rising &ldquo;morning watch.&rdquo; All servants of God emphasize morning watch. The term <em>morning watch</em> itself tells us that it is done early in the morning. Have you heard of anyone who keeps watch when the sun is already up? Never! One keeps morning watch early in the morning. This is a good habit, and we Christians should cultivate this habit. God&rsquo;s children should not be sloppy people. The church has been practicing this for years. We should maintain this good habit of meeting God early in the morning. The term <em>morning watch</em> is not found in the Bible. We can give it another name, but no matter what name we give to it, meeting God early in the morning is a very crucial matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. WHAT TO DO IN THE EARLY MORNING</h2>
<p>We do not merely rise up early. There must be spiritual exercise and spiritual content to what we do. Here are a few things to do early in the morning:</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Fellowship with God</h2>
<p>Song of Songs 7:12 shows us that the early morning is the best time to fellowship with the Lord. To fellowship means to open up our spirit and our mind to God and allow Him to enlighten us, speak to us, impress us, and touch us (Psa. 119:105, 147). During this time our hearts are drawn near to God, and we allow God to draw near to our hearts. We should rise up early in the morning to tarry before the Lord, to meditate, to receive leading and impressions from God, to learn to touch Him, and to give Him an opportunity to speak to us.</p>
