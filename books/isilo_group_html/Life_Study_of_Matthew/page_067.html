Regarding Murder</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Old Law&mdash;Not to Murder</h2><p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.&rdquo; The old law was the command not to murder. What &ldquo;you have heard&rdquo; in verses 21, 27, 33, 38, and 43 is the law of the old dispensation; whereas what &ldquo;I say to you&rdquo; in verses 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, and 44 is the new law of the kingdom, complementing the law of the old dispensation.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The New Complementing Law&mdash;<br />Not to Be Angry with the Brother,<br />Not to Contemn the Brother,<br />and Not to Condemn the Brother</h2><p>In verse 22 the King said, &ldquo;But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the Sanhedrin; and whoever shall say, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.&rdquo; The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder. Hence, the demand of the new law of the kingdom is deeper than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. The word &ldquo;brother&rdquo; in verse 22 proves that the King&rsquo;s word here is spoken to believers.</p><p>The most difficult thing for us to do is to control our anger. Some were supposed to be very gentle, but their anger was like a wild horse when they lost their temper. When our anger is released, no one can bridle us or control us. For a number of years I could not get through this chapter because of the problem of my anger.</p><p>It is also very difficult for us not to contemn or condemn others. In verse 22 the Lord speaks about saying to our brother, &ldquo;Raca,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Moreh.&rdquo; The word Raca is an expression of contempt meaning stupid, good-for-nothing. Moreh, that is, fool, is a Hebrew expression of condemnation indicating a rebel (Num. 20:10). This expression is more serious than the expression of contempt, Raca. How difficult it is neither to condemn a brother nor to hold him in contempt! Perhaps you cannot go for even a week without condemning or contemning someone. It seems that nearly every day we either contemn or condemn. Husbands and wives contemn and condemn one another. I do not believe there is one exception. Every wife has contemned and condemned her husband, and every husband has done the same to his wife. This is a real problem. When you read this, can you still say that you are the overcomers, the kingdom people? Do not be disappointed. Rather, be encouraged. Remember, we have an overcoming life. Do you not have the King within you? We are the kingdom people, and we have the King within us. This King is the kingly, overcoming life. Do not look at yourself. If you do, you will be fully discouraged. Forget yourself and look at the kingly life within you. It is this life that makes us the kingdom people. Forget your natural life and follow this kingly life.</p><p>In verse 22 there are three kinds of judgment. The first is the judgment at the gate of the city, which is the district judgment. The second is the judgment by the Sanhedrin, which is the higher judgment. The Sanhedrin is a council composed of the chief priests, the elders, the lawyers, and the scribes. It is the highest court of the Jews (Luke 22:66; Acts 4:5-6, 15; 5:27, 34, 41). The third is the judgment by God through the Gehenna of fire, which is the highest judgment. These three kinds of judgment were mentioned by the new King, using figures of the Jewish background, because all His audience was Jewish. However, concerning the kingdom people, the believers of the New Testament, all these judgments refer to the judgment of the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ, as revealed in 2 Corinthians 5:10; Romans 14:10, 12; 1 Corinthians 4:4-5; 3:13-15; Matthew 16:27; Revelation 22:12; and Hebrews 10:27, 30. This clearly reveals that the New Testament believers, although forgiven by God forever, are still liable to the Lord&rsquo;s judgment, not for perdition, but for discipline, if they sin against the law of the kingdom as given here. However, when we sin against the new law of the kingdom, if we repent and confess our sins, we shall be forgiven and cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus (1 John 1:7, 9).</p><p>In verse 22 the new King speaks of the Gehenna of fire. The word Gehenna is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew <i>Ge Hinnom,</i> valley of Hinnom. It was a deep and narrow valley near Jerusalem, the refuse-place of the city, where the bodies of criminals and all kinds of filth were cast. It was also called Tophet, or Topheth (2 Kings 23:10; Isa. 30:33; Jer. 19:13). Because of its continual fire, it became the symbol of the place of eternal punishment, the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15). This word is also used in Matthew 5:29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5; and James 3:6.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Matthew &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
