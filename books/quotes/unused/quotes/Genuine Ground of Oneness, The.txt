Satan, the enemy of God, hates this matter of the church ground, which has been concealed from the Lord's people for centuries
They tend to take the church for granted and concentrate on matters such as salvation, holiness, victory, and spirituality
If we see that the church is the Body, the fullness, of the all-inclusive Christ, we shall never again regard it as an insignificant matter
Christ has not presented such gifts to the church for the purpose of accomplishing a work of evangelism, Bible teaching, or edification
According to Ephesians, God's purpose is related to the church, and He has given all the gifts for the building up of the church
Peter received the revelation that Jesus was the Christ, the One appointed by God to accomplish God's commission
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him as the Son of the living God, not only as the Savior and the Redeemer
According to the book of Romans, all those who have been justified through faith in Christ are members of the Body of Christ
In order to be members of the Body, we must firstly become sons of God; that is, we must firstly be 'son-ized'
For this reason, sonship is mentioned in chapter eight of Romans, whereas the Body is mentioned in chapter twelve
The gates of Hades refer to the realm of Satan's power, whereas the kingdom of the heavens refers to the realm of God's rule
The Lord Jesus did not say that the gates of Hades would not prevail against the millions of Christians saved through Him
Before the Lord's recovery came to this country, there was none of the kind of spiritual warfare that we see today
We in the recovery are small in number, especially compared to the Roman Catholic Church and the major denominations
Before the Lord began to recover the church life in this country, the power of darkness could afford to be at rest
Now that the Lord is in the process of building up the proper church life, this power rises up against the church
The conflict between the church and the gates of Hades is a further indication of the importance of the church
Wherever the church is, there the gates of Hades cannot prevail, for there the kingdom of the heavens is powerful and prevailing
Many so-called spiritual believers care only for the content of the church, the testimony, but not at all for the ground of the church
Although we very much appreciate our spirit and our soul, we also devote a great deal of attention to the care of our physical bodies
In dealing with spirituality or with the spiritual testimony of the church, on the contrary, the problems may be fewer
Because the ground of the church is neglected, there is no practical expression of the church in today's Christianity
More than fifty years ago in China, the Lord raised up a group of young Christians and brought them into His recovery
These divisions are all related to the neglect of the ground of the church, not of the content or testimony of the church
The Bible reveals four great acts or activities of God: creation, election, the new creation, and the New Jerusalem
Genesis 1:26 says, 'And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion'
On the one hand, with reference to the church, we may speak of the church in a particular locality, such as the church in Anaheim
On the other hand, we may also refer to the church by using such pronouns as we and us to denote the members of the church
In referring to the church, we may speak either of the church in singular number or of us, the believers in Christ, in plural number
Just as the church is a corporate entity, so, in the same principle, the man created by God was a corporate man
The nations were devilish because they were divisions of the corporate man created by God for the fulfillment of His purpose
For the sake of His eternal purpose, God came in to call out one man, Abraham, to be the father of the called race
When the descendants of Abraham were about to enter into the good land, God charged them not to worship at the place of their choice
Rather, they were required to go to the place of God's choice, to the place He had chosen to put His name and for His habitation
No matter how many Israelites there might have been, they were required to come to this unique place three times a year
During the years of His ministry, the Lord had miraculously fed a multitude of people on at least two occasions
For this reason, only one church was produced on the day of Pentecost, the day that marked the beginning of the church life
Although Abraham's descendants were to be as the sand of the seashore, God nonetheless originally called just one person
As the corporate man of Gods creation was divided into nations so the corporate man of Gods new creation has been divided into denominations
The nations damaged the one man of God's creation, and the denominations have damaged the corporate man of God's new creation
In this unique city we see one throne, one street, one river, and one tree of life on either side of the river
According to Ephesians 1:10, Christ, who is the center of God's economy, will ultimately head up all things through the church
The oneness about which we are speaking is not a partial oneness; it is a great, complete, comprehensive oneness, a oneness in entirety
Genesis 2:8 says, 'And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed'
The oneness in God's economy, the great oneness revealed in entirety in the Scriptures, can be preserved only by life
Although there are many members in the body, all the members are one because they all share one life, the life of the body
If Adam had eaten of the tree of life, all his descendants, even though they number in the millions, would have been kept in oneness
Because Adam partook of the tree of knowledge, the essence of division was injected into him, and his descendants were divided
Because of Babel, God was forced to give up the created race and to initiate another action His selection of Abraham
When Abrahams descendants the children of Israel made their exodus from Egypt and were brought into the wilderness they built a tabernacle
If Moses and the children of Israel had departed from the tent of meeting, they could not have heard the word of God
According to the Old Testament, He was happy to reside in the tabernacle built for Him in the wilderness by His people
Today God is still speaking in the tent of meeting, that is, in the center of oneness and on the ground of oneness
The children of Israel not only enjoyed the oracle of God; they were also abundantly satisfied with the fatness of God's house
In Psalm 36:9 the psalmist goes on to say, 'For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light'
Those from Dan could enjoy singing, but unless they went to Mount Zion, they could not enjoy the commanded blessing
Now we shall go on to consider how life and light are the essence of the oneness of the church as God's new creation
In John 17 the Lord deals with the matter of oneness not by teaching His disciples about it, but by praying regarding it
In verse 11 the Lord prayed, 'Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are'
As we taste the sweetness of the Lord in the church meetings, we receive the supply of life and experience the enlightenment of life
In chapter twenty-one we mainly see the matter of light, whereas in chapter twenty-two we primarily have the matter of life
In the New Jerusalem there will be no need of natural light because the city will be enlightened by the glory of the Triune God
The water of life here is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply
May we all be deeply impressed with the fact that oneness can be prevailing and can be preserved only by life and light
The line of death begins from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and, passing through the great Babylon, ends with the lake of fire
Division, on the contrary, is on the line of death, originates with Satan, and issues in the great Babylon and, ultimately, the lake of fire
If we would see the great truth of oneness in the Bible, we need to be clear about these two sources, lines, and results
God's four great acts are related to creation, election, the new creation, and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth
Apart from God, the only proper source in the universe, there is another source, Satan, with another element and issue
We can go on to say that in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more sin, worldliness, flesh, self, or Satan
It comprises such negative things as Satan, sin, worldliness, the flesh, the self, the old man, and evil temper
Do not think that division stands by itself and that it is not related to such things as the flesh, the self, and worldliness
In the oneness revealed in these verses, we have God the Father, Christ the Lord, and the Spirit as the giver of life
In the street will flow the river of the water of life, and on either side of the river there will be the tree of life
When God looked upon the earth, He beheld its corruption, 'for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth'
Some historians believe that inscribed on the bricks used to build the tower and city of Babel were the names of idols
Although it was necessary for God to give up the created race, He did not give up His eternal purpose with man
According to His mercy, He appeared to a member of the Adamic race, Abraham, and called him out of his environment
God charged Abraham to leave his country and his kindred and to go to the land He would give Abraham and his descendants
Eventually, under the Lord's blessing, Abraham's descendants, the children of Israel, numbered in the hundreds of thousands
After the children of Israel made their exodus from Egypt, they entered into the good land, the land God had promised to Abraham
According to the book of Deuteronomy, God commanded them not to exercise their own choice regarding the place of corporate worship
According to God's choice, the temple was built on Mount Zion, and three times a year God's people were to make their journey there
One day, however, the nation was divided into two kingdoms, into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah
To prevent this from happening and to preserve his kingdom, Jeroboam set up idols in a rival center of worship
Some may defend his action by pointing out that he did not establish a center for worldly entertainment, but a place for the worship of God
According to the principle in 1 Kings 12:26-30, in many Christian groups there are 'idols' set up to attract people and to hold them
If we are under the shining of the heavenly light we shall realize that in so many Christian groups idols have been set up in place of God
We see that the aspiration for the house of God was so strong that the psalmist desired even to be in the courts of the Lord
Simply the desire to be in the presence of God in the house of the Lord repels divisiveness and all the negative things it includes
As the case of Jeroboam makes clear, such a divisive action opens the way for idolatry and all manner of evil things to enter in
According to the record in the Old Testament, the sin of Jeroboam, the sin of division, opened the way for every kind of evil to come in
Before coming into the church life, many among us were rather loose and did things according to their preference
We can testify that shortly after we came into the Lord's recovery, our conscience began to function in a proper way
Their conscience began to lose its function, and the negative and worldly things they had put off gradually returned
More than thirty-five years ago a young woman from a wealthy family came into one of the church meetings in Chefoo
These virtues were theirs simply because they were right with the temple, with the Holy of Holies, and with the ark
When they remained in the oneness by being right with the temple, there was no need for them to try to be holy, victorious, or spiritual
According to verse 5, Babylon the Great is called 'The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth'
Outwardly Babylon the Great is clothed in purple and scarlet and is gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls
Christendom may have the golden cup, but the contents of the cup are idolatry, fornication, and every kind of evil
According to Deuteronomy 14:23, God's people were to eat the tithes before the Lord their God in the place which He would choose
The book of Deuteronomy is concerned with the enjoyment of the riches of the good land, a land described as flowing with milk and honey
Because Moses was concerned about their enjoyment of the good land he spent a great deal of time to instruct them regarding life in the land
The book of Deuteronomy, therefore, is a word spoken by an aged, loving father concerning the future enjoyment of the children
In Deuteronomy 12 the desire of God's heart with respect to the living of the children of Israel in the good land is made known
For this reason, Paul could say in Romans 15:4, 'For whatever was written before was written for our instruction'
One of the most important types in the Old Testament is that of the good land, which is a full and complete type of Christ
Corinthians 5:7 indicates clearly that the Passover was a type of Christ: 'For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us'
After the children of Israel had made their exodus from Egypt, they enjoyed the manna as they wandered in the wilderness
Although some Christians realize that manna is a type of Christ, not many see that the good land is also a type of Christ
Before coming into the church life, most of us worshipped in places typified by the mountains, hills, and green trees
Some Christians may agree that there is idolatry in Catholicism but they may insist that there are no idols to be found in the denominations
Those in the denominations may argue that such names are not idols, but simply means used to designate them as groups of Christians
Idols are found virtually everywhere in today's Christianity, for in so many places there is a name other than the name of Christ
According to Deuteronomy 12, the children of Israel were to destroy all the places where the pagans worshipped their idols
If we act according to our preference, we indulge our lust, for we satisfy our own desire regarding the place of worship
Deuteronomy 12:8 says, 'Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes'
There are a number of reasons the Lord commands us not to do what is right in our own eyes, but to go to the place of His choice
The children of Israel were required to separate unto the Lord the top tenth, the tithe, of the produce of the good land
These verses indicate that the Israelites also had to present the sacrifices for vows and free-will offerings in the place of God's choice
They had no choice except to bring these offerings to the place God had chosen for His name and His habitation
Whenever we deliberately stay home from the meetings, we find that we are not able to enjoy the top portion of Christ
We are required to go to the place God has chosen; we are not allowed to act according to our own choice or preference
If we seek to avoid the presence of a certain brother, we shall not be able to enjoy the top portion of Christ
If we do not abuse God's grace but are fully subdued by coming to the place of His choice, the oneness will be preserved
The first principle is that the place chosen by God must not have any name other than the name of God and Christ
In the church life we should not be known or characterized by the expression of opinion, but by the exercise of the spirit
If in a particular place we do not sense the enjoyment of the Lord, we should question whether or not it is the place God has chosen
According to the principle, today we may discern the place of God's choice by the enjoyment of the riches of Christ
It is a place where the human spirit is prevailing, where the riches of Christ are enjoyed, and where we rejoice before the Lord
According to verses 2 and 3, the children of Israel were to destroy the worship centers, the idols and images, and the names
If we are enlightened by this portion of the Word, spiritually speaking we shall destroy all the places, idols, and names
From the time of the second century, the church has been divided over such things as opinions concerning the Person of Christ
The history of Christianity proves that the most striking aspect in which it has followed the world is the matter of division
The pagan practice of division, of following our own choice, taste, or preference, is found throughout Christianity
Even to entertain the thought of division is to take the way of the pagan system, the divisive practice of the custom of the nations
They were not to choose places according to their own preference; rather, they were to go to the unique place chosen by God
As revealed in other books of the Old Testament, this unique place was Mount Zion in Jerusalem where the temple, the house of God, was built
Nowhere in the book of Deuteronomy were God's people told that they should go to the unique place to engage in mere 'worship'
Of course they were expected to worship the Lord in the place He had chosen but not to worship according to their concept of what worship is
According to the natural, human concept, to worship is to kneel, to bow down, or to prostrate ourselves before God
When they came to the place God had chosen, God's people were to eat the top portion of the offerings and sacrifices before God
According to this portion of the Word, proper worship is a matter of eating before God the rich produce of the good land
In the church He is bringing us back to genuine worship, back to the enjoyment of Christ in the unique place of God's choice
In the same principle, the riches of Christ are the factor, the cause, of our rejoicing in the place of God's choice
The fact that the church is God's habitation, God's dwelling place, indicates that His presence is in the church
Many of us can testify that in other places we did not have the reality or actuality of the Lord's name and presence
In these verses we see how God's people worshipped Him through enjoying the riches of the good land in God's presence
According to this Psalm, the Lord leads us from one station to another until we are brought to the house of the Lord
We should not simply visit in the house of the Lord; we should dwell there 'to the length of days,' that is, forevermore
If we would behold the beauty of the Lord and inquire in His temple, we need to dwell in the Lord's house, the church
Psalm 368 says They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
In Old Testament times, God's people could enjoy this fatness only in the place God had chosen for His habitation
Although the Christian religion knows nothing of such worship, the Lord is recovering it in the church life today
When the psalmist uttered these words, he was in captivity, having lost the enjoyment related to the Lord's house
As we have pointed out elsewhere, in the Gospel of John we have grace and truth, but in the First Epistle of John we have love and light
In 1 Timothy 3:15 and 16 we see that the church, the house of the living God, is the pillar and base of the truth
Today many Christians are seeking light and truth, but not many seek them for the purpose of being led to God's chosen place
If our purpose is to be brought to the holy hill and to God's dwelling place, light and truth will surely come to us
When we realized that we must take the way of the church, light began to shine again, and truth appeared more fully than before
According to the type, we today must also go to the place of God's choice, the church, if we would present our offerings to the Lord
Many of us can testify that when we attempted to offer something to God outside the church, that offering was not very pleasant
If we are not willing to be subdued, we shall fight with the elders, with the other brothers and sisters, and even with our husband or wife
When we bring our burnt offerings to the church and offer them to the Lord in the church, there is incense to match our offerings
It is possible to present offerings to the Lord outside the church, but with these offerings there is no fragrance
When we offer something to the Lord in the church, we sense that we present our offerings 'with the incense of rams'
Only in the church life can the offerings be presented to God in a proper way, in a way that is fragrant and satisfying to Him
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God'
It is a place for little sparrows to abide, a place for the swallow to build a nest for herself, where she may lay her young
In ancient times, both in the tabernacle and in the temple, there were two altars: one in the outer court and the other in the holy place
The altar in the holy place, the golden altar, was the altar of incense, which signifies the resurrected Christ as our acceptance to God
They need to apprehend how Christ is the crucified One at the offering altar and the resurrected One at the incense altar
At these altars we find a true resting place, a nest where we are nourished and cherished and where we may be at rest
In verse 4 the psalmist goes on to say, 'Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be praising thee all the day long'
In verse 5 the psalmist continues, 'Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them'
In the church life we may pass through the valley of weeping, but we can cause this valley to become a well, even a place of springs
Those who enjoy the church life can say, 'I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness'
These verses from Psalm 92 indicate that the unique place of God's choice is not only the proper place to offer sacrifice and to worship God
The proper Christian life is a life that is planted in the church and that flourishes in the courts of the church life
These attributes spontaneously become theirs because they are planted in the church life and are flourishing in the church life
In verse 3 the dwelling in oneness is likened to the dew of Hermon and to 'the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion'
Even in Old Testament times, when God's people came to a material temple, they enjoyed a wonderful life in the house of God
Spiritually speaking, we must destroy every place other than the church and every name other than the name of Christ
Having come to the church, we should have nothing other than the Person of Christ and the unique way of the cross
As we enjoy Him before God, this enjoyment will become our worship, our church life, and even our Christian daily living
Some may think that this oneness is simply a matter of the three Persons of the divine Trinity having no dispute, argument, or dissension
The Lord says that He has given us the very glory the Father has given Him in order that we may be one in the Father and the Son
Because we have received from the Son the very glory He has received from the Father, we may be one even as the Father and the Son are one
Verse 23 is even stronger than verses 21 and 22 regarding oneness, for it speaks of our being perfected into one
The result is that, according to the power which operates in us, there is glory to God in the church and in Christ Jesus
Paul prays to the Father to strengthen the saints through His Spirit into the inner man so that Christ may make His home in their hearts
Many references to the Triune God, especially in the Epistles, indicate the process through which God has passed
The Lord prayed that we would be one in the same way, even that we would be one 'in Us,' that is, in the Triune God
Although in verse 2 the King James Version speaks of ointment, most other versions use the Hebrew word for oil
We have pointed out that, by contrast, the refreshing, watering, and saturating dew was on a place, the mountains of Zion
The ointment did not actually run down upon Aaron's beard; it spread upon his beard and then went down to the skirts of his garments
Although this is revealed in the New Testament, we do not see in the New Testament the way to practice this oneness
According to Exodus 30, the anointing oil is a compound formed by blending four spices with a hin of olive oil
In this compound Spirit we have not only divinity but also Christs humanity the effectiveness of His death and the power of His resurrection
In this 'paint' we have the humanity of Christ, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the power of Christ's resurrection
The proper church life is a life in the oneness which is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the believers
The more we are 'painted' in this way, the more our natural constitution, temperament, and disposition are eliminated
The more the 'paint' of the processed Triune God is applied to our being, the more difficult it is for us to be divided
The oneness in the churches in the Lord's recovery involves the application of the Triune God to our inward being
The reason is that the anointing oil is not for individualistic members; it is for the Head and the Body, even for the Head with the Body
By this word the Lord indicated that He would not take away the thorn, but He would supply Paul with His sufficient grace
We are 'painted' with the processed God, and we are graced with the very same processed God as our life supply
John 17:21-23 indicates that the believers are to be one in the Triune God just as the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father
In Ephesians 446 Paul lists seven aspects of oneness one Body one Spirit one hope one Lord one faith one baptism and one God and Father
The Spirit in verse 4 is no doubt the compound, all-inclusive Spirit who is within the Body and gives life to the Body
According to 1 Corinthians 12:13, the Body came into existence through the baptism of this all-inclusive Spirit
Anything we drink becomes mingled with our inward being, with our blood and with the very fiber of our organic tissue
When we believed into Him and were baptized into Him, we became one with Him; that is, we were mingled with Him
The one God and Father is over all objectively, through all in a way that is partly objective and partly subjective, and in all subjectively
The Spirit is mingled with the Body, the Body is in the Lord, and the Father is over all, through all, and in all
The Triune God who is mingled with us has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
That genuine oneness referring to such a marvelous mingling is the clear revelation in John 17 and Ephesians 4
We thank the Lord that for nearly all the spiritual things in the New Testament there are types in the Old Testament
The details of this charge are also types, not only instructions that were to be taken literally by God's people at the time
In the same principle, the manna eaten by the children of Israel in the wilderness was a type of Christ as our heavenly food
The land was not only a physical realm possessed by the children of Israel; it was also a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The precious ointment upon Aaron's head spread upon the beard and eventually went down to the skirts of his garment
The church is thus a universal, great person with a number of aspects: the aspects of the Body, the Bride, the new man, and the warrior
In Psalm 133 the oneness of God's people is also likened to the dew of Hermon that descends upon the mountains of Zion
As a place, the church, on the one hand, is the unique Zion; but, on the other hand, it is the many mountains of the one Zion
By receiving the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, we are one with the Triune God
After speaking the words recorded in John 14 through 16, the Lord Jesus offered the prayer to the Father recorded in chapter seventeen
In this prayer the Lord refers to the wonderful and mysterious mingling of the processed Triune God with the believers
Some believers may even be proud of having the kind of disposition that makes it easy for them to be one with other people
A person who boasts of this kind of oneness actually is not able to be one with others over a long period of time
Genuine oneness consists in the anointing of the compound, all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
As we pointed out in the foregoing chapter, the more we are coated with the compound ointment, the more we are one
Those who move from place to place may love the universal church, but they have problems with the local church
As soon as they move there, they are disappointed, finding it no better than the 'mountain' from which they have just moved
In typology Hermon signifies the heavens, the highest place in the universe, and the dew signifies the grace of life
He would regard things such as a job, a house, and an automobile as nothing but 'dung' in comparison to Christ
As many verses in the New Testament make clear, grace is the processed God as the life supply to be our enjoyment
Acts 4:33 says, 'And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all'
All these verses indicate that grace is nothing less than Christ as our life power and life supply for our experience and enjoyment
If we would enjoy the dew which typifies the all-inclusive grace, we must be on one of the peaks, the mountaintops, of Zion
If he consults a pastor in Christianity, the pastor may exhort him with Paul's words about husbands and wives in Ephesians 5
The brothers who live together may experience friction and feel that living in a brothers' house is unbearable
When the brothers feel this way they should go to the Lord contact Him and tell Him that they cannot bear their living situation any longer
A situation that took place in the church in Chefoo more than forty years ago illustrates the sufficiency of the Lord's grace
Eventually, they brought the problem to the elders of the church who endeavored to straighten out the situation
The difference is that the church 'court' cares not for who is right or who is wrong; rather, it supplies grace to meet the need
If those two brothers in Chefoo had separated themselves from the church life, they would have cut themselves off from the Lord's grace
Of having their problem settled through the Lords grace in the church they would have probably tried to settle it in a worldly court of law
Lacking the grace of the Lord, they would have continued to argue with one another according to right and wrong
Because they remained in the church life, the heavenly dew descended upon them, and they enjoyed a wonderful solution to their problem
The brothers can love their wives to the uttermost, and the sisters can submit to their husbands in a full way
These believers may say that as long as they pray and read the Bible, they can experience the Lord in a full way outside the church life
Those, on the contrary, who separate themselves from the church life, cut themselves off from the full supply of grace
In His recovery the Lord has shown us that real oneness is the mingling of the processed Triune God with His chosen people
On the one hand, the processed God is the compound, all-inclusive Spirit that anoints us and 'paints' us day by day
The high places, the green trees, the dedicated pillars, the wooden symbols, and the idolatrous names were restored
According to the record in 1 Kings, two kings Solomon, a good king, and Jeroboam, an evil king took the lead to set up the high places
Fearing that the kingdom would return to the house of David if the people went to Jerusalem to worship Jeroboam made houses on high places
Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah'
Since high places signify divisions, this indicates that the divisions among Christians today are related to these evil things
Most Christians would not go beyond saying that divisions are wrong and unscriptural and that they cannot agree with them
In principle, every high place, every division, in Christianity today involves the uplifting, the exaltation, of something other than Christ
The existence of such a high place always gives an opportunity for the indulgence of lust or for the fulfillment of ambition
Even a very good thing such as Bible study can open the way for lust and ambition to come in, if it is exalted above Christ
Not long after the temple was built, Solomon, the one under whom it was constructed, began to rebuild the high places
After the death of Solomon, Jeroboam, the rival of Rehoboam, king of Judah, built high places for the sake of his ambition
The account of the building of the high places under Solomon and Jeroboam is not merely a record of historical fact
Only three brief portions of the Word are devoted to it: 1 Corinthians 1:10-13a; Romans 16:17-18; and Titus 3:10
In the types and pictures in the Old Testament, the matter of division is developed in a full and complete way
Those involved in these 'high places,' these divisions, had not the least concern for the unique place of God's choice
Because their ambition could not be fulfilled in the church life, they turned their back on the church and even began to oppose it
Simply because their ambition for leadership was not fulfilled in the recovery they left and set up a little hill to fulfill their ambition
If some Christians were to establish a place of worldly entertainment, we would immediately condemn that practice
The preacher hired by him wrote a long book criticizing and defaming Brother Nee and spreading rumors about him
After twenty-one years in the church life, this brother left the church in order to set up a certain kind of 'high place'
If you investigate the situation of today's Christianity, you will learn that every division is an elevation of some kind
If we hold to an attitude of elevating our opinion or preference, we set up a 'high place,' a place of division
Those who opposed speaking in tongues elevated their attitude and preference, whereas those who advocated it uplifted theirs
If this matter of the 'high places' were not of great significance, the Old Testament would not mention it repeatedly
The word every used with respect to the high hills and the green trees shows that this practice was common and very widespread
Although Jehoash also did what was right in the sight of the Lord, the 'high places' were not taken down during his reign
Those who went to the 'high places' might have argued that it was inconvenient to travel the long distance to Jerusalem three times a year
All the 'high places' were torn down, and therefore there was no room for the indulgence of lust or the carrying out of selfish ambition
Israel, the northern kingdom, was conquered by the Assyrians, and Judah, the southern kingdom, was conquered by the Babylonians
Because of the sin of Jeroboam in setting up the high places, the nation of Israel was led into captivity by the Assyrians
As 2 Kings 17:19 says, 'Also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made'
Because Judah would not remove the high places, the Lord eventually sent in the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar
These high places damaged the genuine oneness of God's people, for they hindered many from going up to Jerusalem to worship
By this we see that the situation of today's Christianity is a definite fulfillment of the type in the Old Testament
We think this way because we were born into an environment filled with division, with 'high places' of every variety
There is disagreement not only about the mode of baptism, but also about the water that is used and the name in which believers are baptized
The opinions concerning baptism have caused many divisions, even many elevations that exalt a particular opinion
Eventually, neither group was willing to give in and to care for the feeling of others in order to maintain oneness
He ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in Judah and he offered upon the altar
In Christianity there are many festivals, such as Christmas and Easter, that have been ordained and established by man
The Old Testament reveals not only the damage and loss of the ground of oneness, but also the recovery and testimony of this ground
Jeremiah prophesied that after seventy years of captivity in Babylon, the Lord would bring the people back to the good land
No doubt, men like Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah prayed, but they did not have the ground to offer sacrifice to God
God's people knew that the place for the altar was not in Babylon, but only in the unique place of God's choice in Jerusalem
From our experience both before and after we came into the church life, we can testify that such a consecration was not genuine
After we came into the church life, we found ourselves able to consecrate ourselves to the Lord in a proper and genuine way
For the Old Testament saints the thought of coming into the courts of the Lord's house stirred holy and godly aspirations within them
When God's people returned to Jerusalem, all the positive things that had been lost during their captivity in Babylon were restored
God's returned people were filled with laughter and rejoicing because all the positive things had been restored
These verses declare that the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come with singing unto Zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head
The fact that this matter is repeated shows its importance, for anything in the Bible that is repeated is of special significance
The Lord's testimony does not depend on our efforts; it depends on His work within us on the ground of oneness
After we came into the church life, spontaneously the aspiration for godliness, holiness, and spirituality was stirred within us
If we have a bird's-eye view of the Bible and consider the Bible as a whole, we shall see that it reveals four main figures
The very first verse of the Bible, Genesis 1:1, says, 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
The Old Testament reveals God as the Creator of all things and as the One who loves a particular people, Israel
Receiving the revelation from the Father in the heavens, Simon Peter answered and said, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
After living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, Christ was crucified and then entered into resurrection
Now, through His death and resurrection, the Father's only begotten has become 'the firstborn among many brothers'
His many brothers are the many sons of God and the church , as a corporate expression of God the Father in the Son
In Galatians 1:2 Paul refers to 'the churches of Galatia,' a region of the Roman Empire that included many localities
We have seen that the church is firstly revealed as universal in Matthew 16:18 and then as local in Matthew 18:17
Notice that in these verses there are three froms from Him Who is and Who was and Who is coming from the seven Spirits and from Jesus Christ
According to John 1, the very God who is the Creator in Genesis 1 is the Word who became flesh and tabernacled among us
Having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, He has been enthroned above all kings
For this reason, Revelation 1:4 and 5 specifically say that grace and peace come from the Triune God to the seven churches
God's revelation began with God Himself and continued with Christ and the Spirit until it reached its goal in the local churches
God is embodied in Christ, Christ is realized and experienced as the Spirit who imparts life to us, and the Spirit issues in the churches
The Spirit is the processed allinclusive lifegiving Triune God and the Bride is the church composed of all the churches with all the saints
The fact that the Spirit and the Bride speak the same thing indicates that the Triune God has become utterly one with His redeemed people
In Matthew and John we read of the genealogy of Jesus Christ and of the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among us
In these books we read of the church built by Christ and of the many brothers of the Son of God who are the church
Finally, in the book of Revelation we see that grace and peace are imparted to the local churches from the processed Triune God
If we are clear about the revelation in the Bible, we shall realize that the proper place to enjoy God today is in the local churches
Before we came into the local churches, we never had the sense that we had come home or that we had reached our destination
Many seeking Christians today, on the contrary, are still travelers; they are traveling from one denomination or group to another
It is possible to be such a genuine Christian and still be experientially either in the Gospels or in the Acts
We must be Christians in the book of Revelation; that is, we must be those in God's ultimate and consummate revelation
We must be Christians who enjoy the processed, all-inclusive, life-giving Triune God mingled with the churches
The churches with Christ as their center are the focus in the divine administration for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
Since the Spirit today is speaking to the churches, we must be in one of the local churches in order to hear His speaking
They should be the stands, even the lampstands, that bear the lamp with the oil , shining in the darkness respectively and collectively
They are individual lampstands locally, yet at the same time they are a group, a collection, of lampstands universally
They are not only shining locally, but also bearing universally the same testimony both to the localities and to the universe
They bear the same lamp for the same purpose and are fully identified with one another, not having any individual distinctiveness
The differences of the local churches recorded in chapters two and three are all of a negative nature, not of a positive nature
Throughout the centuries, few Christians have touched the depths of the significance of the lampstands as symbols of the local churches
Gold is the substance with which the lampstand is made the stand is the embodiment of the gold and the lamps are the expression of the stand
Substantially, the lampstand is one, but expressively, it is seven because it is one lampstand with seven lamps
If we only had the record in Exodus, however, it would be difficult to realize that these seven lamps are the Spirit
As we proceed from Exodus to Zechariah, we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of Christ and the seven eyes of God
As we continue on to Revelation, we see that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven eyes which are the intensified Spirit of God
We have a strong basis for saying that the seven lamps are the sevenfold, intensified Spirit as the expression of Christ
We have seen that the lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God; it symbolizes the Triune God embodied and expressed
God the Father as the divine gold is embodied in Christ the Son and then is fully expressed through the Spirit
God, the divine Being, is firstly embodied in Christ and then expressed through the sevenfold, intensified Spirit
Now we have not only the Triune God; in the lampstand we have the Triune God substantially and solidly embodied and expressed
As we have seen, this stand, which is a type of Christ, is expressed through the seven lamps signifying the seven Spirits of God
The seven Spirits of God are not separate from God; they are the seven eyes of God and of the Lamb, the Redeemer
In both Exodus and Zechariah the lampstand is one, but in Revelation it has been reproduced and has become seven
Eventually, in Revelation both the stand and lamps, that is, both Christ and the Spirit, are reproduced as the churches
In Exodus and Zechariah there are just seven lamps, but here in Revelation there are forty-nine lamps, for every lampstand has seven lamps
When Christ is realized, He is the Spirit, and when the Spirit is realized, we have the churches as the reproduction
We have seen that the lampstand is the divine gold embodied into a substantial form to fulfill God's purpose in His move
The lampstand signifies not only the Triune God, but also the move of the Triune God in His embodiment and expression
We have also seen that the local churches are the reproduction of the embodiment and expression of the Triune God
When they returned to Jerusalem, to the ground of oneness, all these holy and spiritual things spontaneously returned
Today our God, the Triune God, is the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the all-inclusive Spirit
Eventually, the Spirit and the Bride, constituted of all the churches with all the saints, will be one and will speak with one voice
More than twenty years ago in Taipei, a certain Christian from America, an intimate friend of ours, was our family physician
Eventually, he admitted that he had some understanding of the ground of oneness, but not of the ground of locality
All those who returned from captivity were required to go back to the ground of oneness, to Mount Zion, where the temple was rebuilt
In the same principle, if we would be in the oneness, we must be in the local oneness, in the practical oneness in our locality
If you are not personally in this oneness, you are not really in the oneness, and you are not actually in the church
325 he called a council at Nicaea to settle theological disputes which were a cause of strife throughout his empire
By the end of the sixth century the Catholic Church was fully formed with the establishment of the papal system
With the Reformation the Bible was released in the language of the people, and the truth of justification by faith was recovered
Luther not only made such a terrible blunder, but he persecuted those believers who emphasized the experience of life
Another kind of reaction to religious formality and deadness was that of mystics such as Madame Guyon and Fenelon
Although this reaction took place in the seventeenth century, there was no recovery of the church life until the eighteenth century
There was no way for the Lord to have a proper start for the church life in either Europe or the United States
Under the leadership of Brother Nee, we studied church history, biographies, and all the important spiritual and doctrinal writings
Gradually we came to discern those practices we should adopt: immersion, eldership, practical holiness, the proper Pentecostal spirituality
To some we appeared to be like Baptists, but to others we resembled the Presbyterians or the Plymouth Brethren
Troubled by the situation, he resolved to re-study the New Testament concerning the boundary of a local assembly
Through this study he saw that the boundary of a local assembly must be the boundary of that locality in which that assembly is
Calling an urgent meeting of the co-workers, he delivered the messages published later in The Normal Christian Church Life
We became utterly clear that the practice of the church life requires us to be on the local ground, that is, on the ground of oneness
Since this matter of the ground of locality was recovered, a number of Christians have argued with us concerning it
Later, by contending for the truth of oneness, we learned how to deal with the various criticisms, objections, and arguments
Eventually, God's people were carried away into captivity, some to Egypt, others to Assyria, and still others to Babylon
Although these three groups were divisions, the fourth group, constituted of those who had returned to Jerusalem, was not a division
As even the United Nations recognizes, the Jews in Israel make up the nation of Israel, whereas the Jews in New York do not
Simply because they have not returned to the land of their fathers, they cannot be regarded as the nation of Israel
To be part of the nation of Israel one must be not only a Jew he must be a Jew on the proper ground, that is, in the good land
Only those Jews who have returned to the original ground of oneness, to the land of their fathers, are part of the nation of Israel
In the same principle to be part of the local church one must not only be a Christian but must also be a Christian on the ground of oneness
Only those believers who have forsaken every divisive ground and have come back to the ground of oneness constitute the church
No matter how few they may be in number, those who have returned to the ground of oneness are the church in their locality
When speaking of the ground of oneness, learn to use the illustration of the return of the children of Israel from captivity
Do you know why many of God's people remained in Babylon instead of making the long journey back to Jerusalem?
The reason was they were settled comfortably in Babylon and did not want to pay the price to return to the good land
They may be very devoted to the nation of Israel, but they find it inconvenient to move there to be part of that nation
We must pay the price to stand on the ground of local oneness no matter what evil things others may say about us
We praise the Lord for the vision concerning the destruction of the high places and the recovery of the local oneness
