<h2 class="head1">I. THE VISION OF GOD<br />IN A TRANSPARENT AND CLEAR HEAVEN</h2><p>The scene in chapter nineteen was dark and threatening. But suddenly, in chapter twenty-four the thick cloud passes away, and the sky becomes clear and beautiful. Exodus 24:9 and 10 say, &ldquo;Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness&rdquo; (lit.). Beneath God&rsquo;s feet they saw something that had the appearance of a large transparent stone. Because human words cannot describe this scene, verse 10 says that they saw &ldquo;as it were a paved work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;as it were&rdquo; indicate that human language cannot adequately describe this marvelous sight. Moses could only liken what they saw under God&rsquo;s feet to a transparent sapphire stone, which was like the body of heaven in clearness.</p><p>Verse 11 goes on to say, &ldquo;They looked upon God, and did eat and drink&rdquo; (lit.). While they were looking upon God, they ate and drank. As they experienced a most wonderful sight, they were refreshed by eating and drinking. Those on the mountain saw something no one had ever seen before. God&rsquo;s redeemed, terminated, and replaced people were given a wonderful view of Him, even of His feet.</p><p>To see such a vision of God is to worship Him. Exodus 24:1 says that those who went up the mountain with Moses were to worship afar off. But in the following verses nothing further is said about the worship of God. If we read this chapter carefully and thoughtfully, we shall wonder when they worshipped Him. The worship in this chapter consists of beholding God and of eating and drinking. This is true worship, the worship God desires. God does not want us to worship Him by prostrating ourselves before Him. He wants us to enjoy Him and to worship Him out of this enjoyment. Have you ever been in a chapel or cathedral where the people worshipped God by eating, drinking, rejoicing, and enjoying the Lord? This kind of worship is altogether contrary to our religious concept. Yet this is the worship described in verse 11: &ldquo;They looked upon God, and did eat and drink.&rdquo; This was the way they worshipped Him.</p><p>We should not try to analyze the Bible according to our natural mentality, and we should not try to systematize biblical doctrine. John 1:18 says that no one has seen God at any time, but Exodus 24 says that the seventy elders and the others who were with Moses saw God. They even saw God&rsquo;s feet. Moses does not say that a paved work of transparent sapphire was under God&rsquo;s feet; he says that what was under His feet was &ldquo;as it were&rdquo; a work of transparent sapphire. In Colossians 1:15 Paul speaks of the invisible God. How can the invisible God be seen? Questions like these remind us that the Bible is divine, spiritual, and mysterious and cannot be systematized or analyzed by the natural mind.</p><p>We need to apply the record in Exodus 24 to our spiritual experience. We have been redeemed, we have experienced the termination of the cross, and, at least to some extent, we have experienced being replaced by Christ. We can testify that we have been brought into fellowship with God. At first, this fellowship is somewhat obscure. But eventually, during the course of our fellowship with the Lord, the sky becomes clear and even beautiful. Then it seems that a certain spiritual element comes into view. This element can be compared to transparent sapphire, which is as clear as the body of heaven. When we experience such fellowship it is difficult to say where we are. This is beyond words. If you have experienced the Lord in this way, it is a sign that your fellowship with Him has been enriched and uplifted.</p><p>We have pointed out that in chapters nineteen and twenty the fellowship between the children of Israel and God was obscure, for a cloud of thick darkness was present. But in chapter twenty-four, after the blood of the covenant was sprinkled on the people, the sky immediately became clear. There was no thunder and no sense of threat, tension, or uneasiness. The entire atmosphere became tranquil and peaceful. Have you not entered into such an atmosphere in your fellowship with the Lord? Have you not experienced this kind of situation in your contact with Him? I can testify that many times I have had a vision of the Lord like that described in Exodus 24. The sky above me was clear, and in front of me there seemed to be something like a beautiful, transparent sapphire like the body of heaven in its clearness. There, in such a spiritual environment, I saw God.</p><p>When some hear us testify of seeing God in this way, they may find fault and say, &ldquo;This is absurd and even heretical. The Bible tells us that no one has ever seen God. God is invisible. How can you claim to have seen Him?&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God&rdquo; (Matt. 5:8). Certainly He was not in error in saying this, and He did not contradict the Bible. In my fellowship with the Lord I like to have a clear sky and to see a work of transparent sapphire underneath Him. I am happy when there is nothing between me and the Lord, when there is no cloud, shadow, or obscurity and everything is clear. Those who have had a certain amount of experience with the Lord can bear witness to what I am speaking concerning the vision of God in a transparent and clear heaven.</p><p>Only when we are in such a clear atmosphere can we receive the heavenly vision of the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This was necessary for seeing the vision of the tabernacle in the Old Testament, and it is necessary also for seeing the vision of the church today. The vast majority of the people, however, were at the foot of the mountain and could not see this view. They might have seen something, but they did not have as full a view as did those who were with Moses on the mountain.</p><p>Those who see God according to the scene described in Exodus 24 are &ldquo;nobles&rdquo; among the human race. They are particular people who have entered into a particular state. They have seen God in a transparent and clear sky. This experience itself is very noble. Have you not had such a noble time with the Lord? Many of us can testify of having had this kind of noble experience. Those who have had this experience of seeing the Lord under a transparent and clear sky will not trade it for anything in the world. Nothing can compare with it.</p><p>If you have not had the kind of spiritual vision described here, it may indicate that you have not yet come to Mount Sinai in your experience with the Lord. You need to come to Mount Sinai and stay there with the altar, the sacrifices, and the blood. Then in your fellowship with the Lord, the sky will eventually become clear and transparent. It will seem that in front of your eyes there is something which resembles the body of heaven in its clearness. Then, in such an environment, you will see God and the heavenly vision concerning the desire of His heart to have a dwelling place on earth. The reason there is virtually nothing said among Christians today concerning God&rsquo;s dwelling place is that many believers have never come to Mount Sinai to receive the vision of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Many of those who are truly saved have not yet come up the mountain to behold the Lord in a transparent and clear heaven.</p>
