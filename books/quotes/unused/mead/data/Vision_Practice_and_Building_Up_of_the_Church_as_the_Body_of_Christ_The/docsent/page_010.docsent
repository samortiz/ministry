   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE THREE MAIN ITEMS OF GOD S PURPOSE FOR THE CHURCH 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:4-5; 3:9-11; 1:10, 21-23; Rom 8:19-21; Rev 22:1-2; 21:23-24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am still burdened to speak about God s purpose concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In my spirit is a realization that we are not deeply enough impressed with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps many of us have a little understanding, but we may not have been brought into a full realization.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, we should be able to speak the things we have heard and minister what we have been impressed with.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we said in the previous messages, there are three main items of God s purpose for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first is that the church must have the full sonship Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second is that God may show His wisdom to the enemy through the church 3:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, God s purpose is to head up all things in Christ through the church 1:10, 21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This utterance is brief, clear, effective, and full.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In studying the book of Ephesians, the verses cited above are the most difficult verses for people to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, God s purpose with the church is in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not know these verses, we are blind concerning the main items of God s purpose for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sonship, God s wisdom made known, and the heading up of all things are the three main items of God s purpose concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE DIVINE SONSHIP BEING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>OUR FULL SANCTIFICATION BY GOD MINGLING WITH US</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s eternal purpose is to work Himself into us, to absolutely and thoroughly mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way for God to work Himself into us and thoroughly mingle with us is by being our life and our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we first need to be born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By this divine birth, the second birth, we become the children, the sons, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By being the sons of God, we have the life and nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our new birth is the beginning of the mingling of God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As sons of God, however, we need growth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our human spirit is the base of the divine work of the Triune God; it is the abode that God first takes within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From the very center of our being our spirit as the base for God s work God spreads Himself to our soul to transform all the parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually He transforms, transfigures, our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way, our whole being will be saturated by God Himself, permeated by His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our whole being will be transformed and mingled with God to be wholly sanctified 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be made holy is to be thoroughly overlaid with God, that is, thoroughly mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Within every part of our being there will be the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The essence of God, God Himself, is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are thoroughly mingled with God, we are wholly sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sanctification Consummating</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>in the Manifestation of the Children of God,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>the Full Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are thoroughly sanctified, we will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that our whole being will be brought into the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be glorified means that we are fully matured.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way we will have the manifestation, the full maturity, of the sons of God Rom 8:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will be our full sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sonship begins from the new birth and consummates in glorification and the manifestation of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sonship is a matter of the new birth, growth, and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In an all-inclusive sense, sanctification includes regeneration in the spirit, transformation for the soul, and transfiguration of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These three things regeneration, transformation, and transfiguration together are complete sanctification 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way our whole being, from the center to the circumference, is wholly sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The end of this sanctification is glorification, and glorification is the manifestation of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today we are the children of God, but we do not yet have the manifestation of the children of God because we are not yet glorified, and we are not yet glorified because we are not fully sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is because our soul has not been transformed, and our body has not been transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the time of the Lord s coming, our body will be transfigured Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then there will be no need to tell people that we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everyone will recognize that we are sons of God, because we will have the manifestation, which is glorification, as the end of our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Regeneration is the new birth, after which come transformation and finally transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Included in this complete sanctification we have glorification, and with this glorification we have the manifestation of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then at the manifestation of the sons of God, we will have the full sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sonship begins with regeneration and consummates with the manifestation of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we have the full sonship, whatever God is, whatever God has, and whatever God has accomplished will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will have the full sonship, and we will be fully in God Himself according to God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is very clear in the Scriptures.</S>
