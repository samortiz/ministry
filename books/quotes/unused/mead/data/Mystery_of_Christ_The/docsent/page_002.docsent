   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:4-6; John 12:32; Luke 12:50-52 THE MYSTERY HIDDEN IN THE AGES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 3:4-6 Paul speaks of his understanding of the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This mystery was not made known to the sons of men in other generations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The men of old did not know of the mystery that God spoke through Paul, which involves the Jews and Gentiles becoming one new man in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the corporate Christ, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 6 of chapter three is a precious verse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The words "fellow members" refer to the new man in Ephesians 2:15.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The new man stands in contrast to the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are many individual men in this world, but there is only one old man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same way, there are many Christians, but there is only one new man the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ONE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to understand what the new man is, we must first understand what the old man is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The old man is the God-created man who fell through sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every person in Adam is not only a sinner before God, but also an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When such a sinner, the old man, hears the gospel and believes in Christ and is saved, he becomes a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only has he become a new man individually; he is joined to all other Christians to become one corporate new man as well.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians 1 speaks of the church as the Body of Christ; chapter two speaks of the church as the new man; chapter three speaks of the mystery of Christ; chapter four speaks of the way to build up the Body of Christ; chapter five speaks of the responsibility of the church; and chapter six speaks of the warfare of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The peak of God's work is the church, which is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God saves us so that we will become a new man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A great lack among Christians today is that everyone wants to be an individual Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everyone wants to be good and zealous; everyone wants to sit and listen to good sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In short, everyone wants to be a Christian in an individual way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But God does not just want us to be good on an individual basis.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is after a corporate vessel that will destroy Satan and accomplish His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God does not want to see Christians scattered like a pan of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wants Christians to be joined together to become a corporate new man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>WHAT IS THE NEW MAN?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 2 speaks of Christ creating one new man out of two groups of people, but it does not tell us what the new man is like.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Colossians 3:10-12, the new man is renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the new man there is no Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The new man is not a matter of having or not having distinctions; it is a matter of either being the new man or being nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The new man is not in the realm of being a Greek or a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The new man is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The nature of the new man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can even venture to say that Christ is the church and the church is Christ, because everything in the new man the church is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The constitution of the new man is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
