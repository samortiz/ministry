   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Later when the Lord was on the cross, He saw His mother and His disciple John standing by, and He said to His mother, "Woman, behold, your son" John 19:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not forget that the Lord had the human nature and human feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For Him to be hanging on the cross and tell His mother not to look at Him but to look at John as her son was a death to the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Death is the threshold of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we enter into death, we should realize that we are on the threshold of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sister who lost her job and her money could complain to God, but she could not forsake God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, she was complaining to God, and on the other hand, she is still with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At a certain point, she should be able to praise the Lord even though she lost all of her savings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She eventually should be able to declare to the universe that even though she does not have any savings, she is still living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She is living not on her savings but on her living God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The living God is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are living by resurrection, not by any money which we have accumulated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we do not have much money, we are released.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, people who have too much money are very burdened because they become anxious about losing it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The parents need to consider what the difference is between having or not having children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, when we do the "mathematics" in the Spirit, we would say that it is about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, we parents surely love our children, but on the other hand, our children cause us much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who do not have any children do not have to experience this trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God uses our children, the loss of our children, and even our not having children to break us that He might have the chance to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we are under the experience of the breaking of our outer man, we will learn to pray not by clear words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We would even tell the Lord that we do not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some saints are too bold to pray too much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They need to learn to groan according to Paul's word in Romans 8:26.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some sisters among us are female "psalmists."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have so much to pray and are so clear about what to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They need to learn to groan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times we do not know what to pray because we cannot figure out what is going on in our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do know, however, that the apostle Paul said in Romans 8:28 that all things work together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of the brothers who come to me for fellowship tell me only the good things, not the bad things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But actually in the universe the night comes first and then the day Gen 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the news I get in my fellowship with the brothers is all in the "day," I am cheated in my realization of the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I know the real situation of the saints in the church, I can pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if I am told that everything is wonderful, everyone is practicing the new way, and everything is in the "day," I am not aware of the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord uses all things, both the things in the "day" and the things in the "night," to transform us and conform us to His image.</S>
