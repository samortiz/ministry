<h1 class="title">THOSE WHO CHOOSE ANOTHER GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Psa. 16:4<br />
This is to explain the difference between the true God and false gods.</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>There is a God in the universe: there must be a God in the universe</li>
<li>There is only one God</li>
<li>God&rsquo;s name is JEHOVAH<br />
<span class="normal">Explain the meaning of the name Jehovah. God is the I AM. God is the One Who is, and Who was, and Who is to come (Rev. 1:4).</span></li>
<li>All other gods are not God<br />
<span class="normal">Explain this point clearly with abundant materials to prove the point.</li>
<li>Those who choose another god
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Those who choose another god worship idols.</li>
	<li>The result of idol worship is the multiplication of sorrows.<br />
	Use a lot of examples to describe the sorrowful conditions of the people who worship idols.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Cast off idols and return to God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Explain that men should worship the Lord of the heavens and the earth.</li>
	<li>This Lord of the heavens and the earth became flesh, and His name is Jesus Christ.</li>
	<li>Today, if a man returns to God, he must return to the Lord Jesus.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to turn to the Lord
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sin separates man from God and leads him to go astray to worship false gods.</li>
	<li>Therefore, man must confess his sins and repent.</li>
	<li>He must accept the redemption of Jesus Christ and receive Him as the Savior.</li>
	<li>He must destroy the idols.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
