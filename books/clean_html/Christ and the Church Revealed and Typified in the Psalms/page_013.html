<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST—THE ONE WITH GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 9 to 16</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 9:11, 14; 11:4; 14:7; 15:1; 16:1-11; Acts 2:25-28, 31</h1><p>Now let us consider the kind of Psalms that follow Psalm 8. They are of the same category as Psalms 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Again, it is pitiful.<h2 class=head1>THE HUMAN CONCEPT AND THE DIVINE</h2><p>We may sketch the spiritual level of the first fifteen Psalms as follows:<p>Do not laugh at the Psalmists; you are just like them. Last night you were in Psalm 8, but this morning you are in Psalm 15, or perhaps still in Psalm 12. This is exactly our situation; we are just like this. Last night it was “Hallelujah! O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!” But when you left the meeting, by the time you got home, you had descended from the peak to the bottom of the valley. You immediately dropped from the top to the bottom, from Psalm 8 to Psalms 9 through 15.<p>We may define Psalms 9 to 15 by saying that the saints, based upon their concept of the law, judge that evil people are abhorred by God and that only the righteous can please God and abide with Him. This again is the concept of the law. Read all these Psalms 9 through 15. There are seven Psalms altogether in this group, and in essence all say the same thing: “O God, the wicked can never praise thee; they are abhorred by thee; only the righteous can please thee and abide with thee.” Meanwhile, while they were expressing something in this way, they still realized their need of the house of God. Why? Because God is universally invisible. If there is not a definite place in which God may dwell, it is difficult to locate Him. For this reason they appreciated the house of God. Psalm 9:11, 14, Psalm 11:4, Psalm 14:7, and Psalm 15:1 all prove that while the saints were expressing their concept of the law and asking God to judge the wicked, they realized their need of the house of God; they realized that God could be located in a solid place, in His dwelling. They praised God in the dwelling place of God, and they declared that God’s salvation issues from His dwelling. They realized their need of God’s house—but this is all.<p>If we do not have the heavenly vision, if we only have the human concept, we will say that every Psalm is wonderful. In a sense, every Psalm is wonderful. But when we have vision from above, we see that many of these so-called good Psalms are in the valley, at the bottom. I know that many of you, at least subconsciously, will not agree with me. You still say, “Psalm 9 is so good; Psalm 11 is wonderful.” I am afraid that some of you still have a great appreciation for Psalm 15. Something within you is still for these Psalms. It does not surprise me, for I was the same as you are. It is because we are short of heavenly vision. With heavenly vision, we see the true value and position of these Psalms.<p>But praise the Lord, we have another Psalm—Psalm 16! Now we must again apply the principle which we have previously mentioned: while the saints are uttering something according to their human concept, the Spirit of Christ intervenes at a certain point to express the divine concept within their expression.<p>Let us firstly read Psalm 15 to see the Psalmist’s expression according to his human concept: “Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.”<p>Is this good or not? Psalm 15:5 says, “He that doeth these things shall never be moved.” But Psalm 16:8 says, “I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.” Have you seen the difference? The difference is that in Psalm 15 you must do many righteous things; then you will not be moved. But Psalm 16 says that if you set the Lord before you, if He is at your right hand, you will not be moved. In Psalm 15:1 the Psalmist asks, “Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?” Who? According to Psalm 15 it is those who do all the things mentioned in that Psalm. But in Psalm 16:11 we read, “Thou wilt show me the path of life: thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.” Have you seen the difference? Now which of these two Psalms do you prefer? Where would you put Psalm 15? And where would you put Psalm 16?
