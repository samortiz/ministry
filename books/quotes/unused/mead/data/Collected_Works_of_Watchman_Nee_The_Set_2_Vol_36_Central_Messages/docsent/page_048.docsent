   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THERE BEING ONLY CHRIST IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians have not seen that there are not many things in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no patience in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no humility, sanctification, or light in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are not many things in the spiritual world; only Christ exists.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord has to do a fundamental work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what we need before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you would not misunderstand me, I will say that we need a second salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our first salvation, we saw that our need was Christ and not works.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We saw that salvation was through Christ and not through work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we need another strong and thorough vision: we do not need things; we need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to have an experience as thorough and strong as our first salvation, and we need to have as many things torn down as when we were first saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When many people were first saved, many things were torn down, and they gained Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, many things need to be torn down in them today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The difference is that what was torn down the first time were sinful things, while the things that need to be torn down now are spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first time their pride, jealousy, vainglory, temper, and other sins were torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now their patience, humility, and so-called holiness need to be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These things must be torn down before they will see that Christ is their life and that He is the One who is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This inward Christianity is absolutely different from the Christianity that man commonly believes in.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you would not be offended, I would say an honest word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the past, many brothers and sisters have come to talk with me and have asked me many questions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I could only say to them, "You may think that you are better than many people, but I am afraid that you will be the same as you are tonight for the rest of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have many things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have a great deal of patience and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are a very capable and nice person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are loving, helpful, and forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are willing to do this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Humanly speaking, it is hard to find a Christian like you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But I must speak an honest word: you only have things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to realize that what is truly spiritual before the Lord are not things, but the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What you are, what you can do, or what you have does not matter; only Christ matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only thing that has any spiritual value is what Christ has accomplished in you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the spiritual world, there are not many things; there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is the matters and things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>TOUCHING CHRIST BEING TOUCHING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps I can cover some practical experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please excuse me for mentioning some of my personal experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During the past few days, a brother encountered an accident at home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of my responsibility, I should naturally have gone to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By visiting him, I would be able to help him by expressing my personal concerns and also save myself a considerable amount of work later we should either want to be a loving Christian or not want to be a Christian at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the strange thing is that when I resolved to visit the brother, I became colder and colder within while I was on the road.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nothing seemed to respond within me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I immediately knew that I was trying to perform an act of love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I was trying to perform an act of brotherly love, but as I was doing it, I touched death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was the right thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was a good thing, but it was not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was doing it myself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After I did this, the result was an inward death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I touched death within, and I became cold.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I touched an act; I did not touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was an act of love, but I did not find the Lord in the act; I could only say that I was the one who loved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every time we touch Christ instead of a work, we touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But every time we touch a work, we will surely die.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Any time we try to do something by ourselves, we will surely die.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to see that Christianity is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Christian life is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not pile a thousand good things together and call them the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if we put all the patience on earth, all the humility, and the myriads of good things together, we still could not make a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we put the myriads of things together, all we would see is a list of things; we would not see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A few years ago, my co-workers were always teasing me about "face-saving."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I not only tried to save my own face, but others' faces as well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I do not like to expose others, and I do not like others to feel bad when they leave my house.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not like to embarrass others by what I say.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before others feel any embarrassment, I become embarrassed for them already.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I like being a gentle person, but when I try to be a good and gentle person before my brothers, something within often tells me that I am dead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I immediately become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no more life in me, and I touch death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The only reason for this is that gentleness is a thing; it is something that I have worked up.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is why I immediately fall into death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I touch a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I become weakened and powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Something within collapses and tells me that everything is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The problem is that, in God's eyes, whenever we are involved with a thing, we find nothing but death in it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once we just have a thing, we immediately touch death because what we have is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But if we touch Christ, we will immediately touch life because Christ is life.</S>
