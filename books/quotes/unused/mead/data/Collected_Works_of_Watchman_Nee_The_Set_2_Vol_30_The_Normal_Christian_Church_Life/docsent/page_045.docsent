   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All positions held by God's ministers are spiritual, not official.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Alas! men have only seen half the truth, so they try to organize the work and appoint a director to superintend the service of others, but their directing is based upon their position in the organization, not upon their position in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason Paul could direct others was that the ministry committed to him by the Lord put him in a position of authority over them; and the reason Titus, Timothy, and Tychicus could submit to being directed was that the ministry committed to them by the Lord put them in a position under his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unfortunately, the directing of today is based upon neither depth of spirituality nor greatness of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Timothy was a man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He lived close to the Lord, obeying and serving Him faithfully; yet many a time he was sent here or there by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not say, Do you think I am incapable of working by myself?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you think I do not know how to preach the gospel and how to found churches?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you think I do not know how to go about things?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Timothy knew a lot, he was willing to obey Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In spiritual work there is such a thing as being directed by others; there is the position of a Paul, and there is also the position of a Timothy, but these are spiritual, not official, positions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we must learn on the one hand to maintain a right relationship with our fellow workers, and on the other hand to be guided by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must maintain both relationships and also maintain the balance between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first and second Epistles to Timothy there are many passages which illustrate how fellow workers should cooperate, and how a younger worker should submit to an older one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A young Timothy ought to obey the commands of the Holy Spirit, but he ought also to receive the instructions of an elderly Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Timothy was sent out by Paul, Timothy was left by Paul at Ephesus, and Timothy obeyed Paul in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here is an example for young servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is most important in His work to learn how to be led by the Spirit and how, at the same time, to cooperate with our fellow workers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The responsibility must not be wholly upon Timothy; neither must it rest wholly upon Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the work Timothy must learn to fit in with Paul, and Paul must also learn to fit in with Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only must the younger learn to submit to the instructions of the elder, but the elder must learn how to instruct the younger.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The one who is in a position to leave, send, or persuade must learn not to follow the dictates of his own nature, acting according to personal inclination or desire, for in that case he will make it difficult for those under his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul must direct Timothy in such a way that he will not find it hard to obey both the Holy Spirit and the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's servants must work together in companies, but there is a kind of co-working which is to be avoided, that is, co-working in a man-made organization which restricts its members so that they cannot really respond to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When workers are entirely subject to the direction of men, then their work is not the outcome of a spiritual burden placed on them by God, but merely the doing of a piece of work in response to the dictates of those holding higher positions than they.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The trouble today is that men are taking the place of the Holy Spirit, and the will of men in official position is taking the place of the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Workers have no direct knowledge of the divine will, but simply do the will of those in authority over them, without bearing any personal burden from the Lord for His work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are others again who know the mind of God, have a call from Him, and depend entirely upon Him for the meeting of all their needs; but while they know what it is to be led of Him individually, they fancy they can just go their own way and do their own work in independence of others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The teaching of God's Word is that, on the one hand, human organizations must not control the servants of God; on the other hand, His servants must learn to submit to a spiritual authority which is based on the difference of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no organized cooperation, yet there is a spiritual fellowship and a spiritual oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Individualism and human organization alike are out of line with the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should seek to know His will, not independently, but in conjunction with the other ministering members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The call of Paul and Barnabas was on this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was not a case of two prophets and teachers only, but of five, waiting upon God to know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Acts 13 gives us a good example of a working company, all the workers being mutually related, and the guidance of one confirmed by the others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE SPHERE OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sphere of the work, unlike the sphere of the local church, is very wide.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of the workers are sent to Ephesus, some go to Paul at Nicopolis, some stay on in Corinth, some are left in Miletus, some remain in Crete, some return to Thessalonica, and others go on to Galatia.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such is the work!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We see here not the movements of the local church but of the work, for the movements of the local church are always confined to one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesus only manages the affairs of Ephesus, and Rome the affairs of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church confines herself to matters in her own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no need for the church in Ephesus to send a man to Corinth, or for the church in Corinth to leave a man in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church here is local, the work extra-local.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome are all the concern of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church only manages the affairs in any given locality, but the workers of God regard as their "parish" the sphere which the Lord has measured out to them.</S>
