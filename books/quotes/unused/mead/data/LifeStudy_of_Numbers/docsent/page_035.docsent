   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One Ewe Lamb a Year Old</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>without Blemish for a Sin Offering</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Nazarite was also to bring "one ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering" v. 14c . Here "ewe" signifies submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This ewe lamb typifies Christ as our sin offering that we may be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the beginning of our Nazarite life, we need redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason we need God's redemption, which has been completed in Christ, is that, no matter how good we may be, we are still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to lay our hands on the ewe lamb which is our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While we are offering ourselves to God to live absolutely, utterly, and ultimately for Him, we realize that we are still sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, as a match to Christ as our burnt offering, we need Christ as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the morning we may pray, "Father, I offer myself to You in Christ as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, Father, I offer my Lord Jesus as my sin offering."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Daily we need Christ as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One Ram without Blemish</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>for a Peace Offering</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Nazarite was also required to offer "one ram without blemish for a peace offering" v. 14d . The "ram" here signifies strong for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This ram typifies Christ as our peace offering for our enjoyment with God in fellowship with peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The result of the burnt offering and the sin offering is the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The peace offering is for the fellowship in enjoyment between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both we and God enjoy Christ as the same object for our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We and God enjoy Christ as the burnt offering and as the sin offering, and this issues in the enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For Christ to be our peace offering means that we and God mutually enjoy Christ and have fellowship in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This fellowship is not just once but is for our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A Basket of Unleavened Bread,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Cakes of Fine Flour Mixed with Oil,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>and Unleavened Wafers Anointed with Oil,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>and Their Meal Offering</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>and Their Drink Offerings</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Finally, the Nazarite was to bring "a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering and their drink offerings" v. 15 . In this verse, "a basket" signifies fullness, "unleavened" signifies without sin, "bread" signifies formed, "cakes" signifies more formed, "fine" signifies even and balanced, "flour" signifies Christ ground in His humanity, "mixed" signifies mingled, "with oil" signifies the Holy Spirit divinity , "wafers" signifies easy to eat, "anointed" signifies poured upon, "meal offering" signifies holy food, and "drink offerings" signifies holy drinks for God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All this typifies Christ in His humanity with His divinity offered to God for us as food both to God and to us and also as holy drinks to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without these types, we could never imagine that Christ has so many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to stay in and muse upon the revelation of Christ in these types in the book of Numbers so that we may enjoy Him more.</S>
