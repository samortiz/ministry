How we thank the Lord that He has afforded us this training a training that will cover the normal Christian life with the proper church life
Our purpose is not to have a training in doctrines, although we still need to know the basic truths and the principles from the divine Word
Eve was made out of a rib, a piece of bone, that came from Adam, indicating that both Adam and Eve proceeded out of the same source
We are not living by ourselves or for ourselves; we are living with God and for God, and God is living with us and for us
Suppose your wife thought of you as a big body, as a giant, approaching you adoringly, bowing herself, and kneeling down to worship you
In ancient times God's people built the temple and established a system of worship complete with priesthood and sacrifices
In Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea we saw that God desires to have a wife who will live together with Him
Gradually, by the working of love, this seeker was changed from a company of horses to a lily that was fragrant, beautiful, and blossoming
Although the word pillar denotes something strong, the seeker was likened to a pillar of smoke , not a pillar of marble
Finally, she becomes the city , the New Jerusalem , without any person of her own, but with the strong Person of Christ within her
In the book of Revelation Christ is unveiled as having a wedding and the New Jerusalem is presented as His wife
In chapter 19 of Revelation we see that Christ will enjoy a wedding feast, and in chapter 21 we see that the New Jerusalem will be His wife
Christ and His chosen people are one universal corporate man with Christ the Husband as the Head and with the church the wife as the Body
In Ephesians 5 the church is presented as a wife, and in Ephesians 1 the church is presented as the Body of Christ
Christ and the church, as a couple, are a matter of love, and Christ and the church, as a man, are a matter of life
If you read the Old Testament carefully, you will discover many kinds of clear and evident prophecies of Christ
The Old Testament tells us of whom Christ was to be born, where He was to be born, and about many of the events in His life
Besides these prophecies, there are types, figures, and shadows revealing and portraying Christ in a detailed way
The Old Testament is also a prediction of the church, not in plain words, but only in types, figures, and shadows
Although the church was not mentioned in the Old Testament in clear and evident words, it was nonetheless typified in a full way
Whatever the Old Testament predicted regarding Christ and the church has been completely fulfilled in the New Testament
He has spread into tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of His believers, making all of them a part of Him
The book of Romans offers us a full definition of this, unfolding both the Christian life and the church life in detail
Following the introduction, we have the section on condemnation that unveils to us the need of God's salvation
Related to this matter of justification we have three other items-propitiation, redemption, and reconciliation
He is no longer merely in creation, redemption, justification, reconciliation, and identification, but He is now within us, in our spirit
Christ is in us doing a transforming and sanctifying work, just as the tea, when put into the water, works the element of tea into it
Although a brother may be quite saintly, his body needs to be glorified because of its physical defects and limitations
In the next message we will see that Christ is the prototype and that we are His duplication, the mass production
In relation to God, selection is for the accomplishment of His purpose; in relation to us, selection is our destiny
We are in the process of life and in the practice of life that we may have the Body life with a proper private life
While we are being sanctified, we are also being transformed from one form into another form and from one shape into another shape
The ultimate consummation of God's salvation is the churches-not just the Body, but the local churches as the expressions of the Body
In the last part of Romans, 12:1-16:27, we have the building, the Body with all of its expressions in the local churches
Keep this one point in mind: that the gospel in Romans concerns Christ as the Spirit in us after His resurrection
If we only have the gospel concerning Christ as in the first four books of the New Testament, our gospel is too objective
Our Christ is not merely the Christ in the flesh after incarnation and before resurrection, the Christ who was among His disciples
Though John chapters 14 and 15 revealed that Christ will be in His believers, yet that was not fulfilled before His resurrection
The book of Romans is the gospel of Christ after His resurrection, showing also that He is now the subjective Savior in His believers
Numerous times in the Holy Scriptures, from Genesis through Malachi, God spoke in promise through the prophets regarding the gospel of God
Paul mentions Christ's humanity first, not His divinity, saying that He was born out of the seed of David according to the flesh
Paul says that He was 'designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead'
Since Christ already was the Son of God before the incarnation, why did He need to be designated the Son of God out of resurrection?
Because by incarnation He had put on an element, the flesh, the human nature, that had nothing to do with divinity
When we behold a little carnation seed before it is sown into the ground, we may be unable to determine what kind of seed it is
If the seed should remain as a seed without blossoming, it is difficult for most people to realize that it is a carnation
After His resurrection He is the Son of God with humanity uplifted, sanctified, and transformed out of resurrection
Paul opens the book of Romans in the way he does because Romans has a goal, as seen in chapter 8, verses 29 and 30
Before His incarnation God's Son only possessed divinity; after His resurrection this Son of God had both divinity and humanity
Just as the Son of God came into the flesh by incarnation, so now the Spirit of the Son of God has come into so many of us who are flesh
We also have the Spirit of holiness within, the human flesh without, and we shall be designated in full as sons of God
Not all the believers are apostles, but, in a sense, all the believers are sent by the Lord for the gospel preaching
Note that the word spirit here begins with a small letter, thereby indicating that it does not refer to the Holy Spirit
The created race had fallen into many things other than God and had become hopeless as far as God was concerned
Abraham became the father of the called race, a race that was not created by God, but a race that was called out by God
We have been called out of everything other than God: out of the old creation, the world, the human race, and ourselves
Whoever believes in Christ shall be saved, and whoever will not believe in Christ has been condemned already because of his unbelief
Nothing is more offensive to God than not believing in Jesus, and, on the contrary, nothing is more pleasing to God than believing in Him
If any sinner, any prodigal son, will say, 'O God, thank You for sending Jesus Christ-I believe in Him,' the Father will be pleased
Grace is God in Christ as everything to us for our enjoyment, and peace is the issue of the enjoyment of God's grace
Here Paul does not say that salvation is out of the love of God or by the grace of God; he says that it comes by the righteousness of God
Because Christ has fulfilled all the righteous requirements of the law, God is bound by His righteousness to save us
If you were blind, the calendar could not be revealed to you, for the revelation of the calendar is out of your sight and to your sight
The first section covers the issue of justification, showing us how to be righteous, how to be just, in the eyes of God
Attention is given to two special classes of mankind-the self-righteous class and the cultured, religious class
Although we do not want to dwell upon the subject of condemnation, there are two points related to it that are quite important
To say that there is no God is to speak vanity; to declare the reality of God is to speak something solid, substantial, genuine, and true
In the United States today we behold evil on every side, and the newspapers are filled with wicked and shameful things
Although mankind knew there was God, they tested and tried Him, eventually deciding not to hold Him in their full knowledge
There are so many divorces and so much immorality throughout the world today because people will not glorify God and worship Him
Most of the people in the United States have learned not to worship visible idols, although some people do practice this
Many people in this country have exchanged God for their self-made idols-their future, positions, degrees, and goals
When a person gives up God and forces God to give him up, that person will be defiled, immediately becoming involved with uncleanness
Such people may become sodomites, indulging in evil passions and unrestricted affection, dishonoring their bodies with one another
When a person has been given up by God to uncleanness, dishonorable lusts, and to a disapproved mind, the consequence is fornication
By this we can see that if a person gives up God, God will give him up to lusts, confusion, and every evil imaginable
The portion of Romans on the condemnation of the self-righteous , along with the condemnation on mankind, shows us the way of restriction
Approximately 20 years ago, the brothers in Taiwan collected biographical material on the famous scientists of the past centuries
All the hair on our physical bodies, both inside and outside, grows downward except for the hair in our throat, which grows upward
The tongue sends the food back to the molars which are like grinding stones, grinding the food into a digestible substance
Although you may argue that it is not wrong to steal from others, the nature within you protests whenever you are tempted to steal
God's law was given according to God's nature, for a lawgiver always enacts a law in accordance with his own being
We need to act according to our nature, heed the voice of our conscience, and care for the proper reasonings within us
Strictly speaking, besides Judaism, Christianity, and the counterfeit religion of Islam, there are no other religions
The teachings of Confucius are nonreligious; they are altogether ethical teachings, having nothing to do with God
On this earth there are just three religions-the genuine religions of Judaism and Christianity and the counterfeit religion of Islam
We see an example of the vanity of religion: attending Mass once a year as a religious duty in order to keep the name of being a Catholic
We need the inward knowledge of God, the knowledge in our spirit, the knowledge that spreads into our whole being
They open the Bible, point their finger to a certain place, and follow the leading given in whatever verse they locate
In John 5:39-40 the Lord Jesus told the Jewish religionists that they search the Scriptures for knowledge, yet will not come to Him for life
Since circumcision is unreal as long as it is practiced as a bare outward form, so baptism can never be real if it is simply outward
In this section of Romans, Paul portrays man as totally evil and gives several proofs that the condition of the world is hopeless
Is the conclusion of Paul's writings on condemnation: the whole world is subject to the righteous judgment of God
Whether we are one of mankind, one of the self-righteous, one of the religious people, or a person in the world, we need Jesus
Martin Luther was raised up by God to wage a fierce battle over justification because it is such a great doctrine in the Bible
Regardless of how righteous we are or how righteous we think we are, our righteousness is just a fraction of an inch high
Although you may be right with everyonewith your parents your children and your friendsyour righteousness will never justify you before God
In the Old Testament times, the way of atonement, that is of expiation, required a sacrifice in which blood was shed
In both places the word propitiation actually means a sacrifice and should be rendered 'propitiatory sacrifice'
The Greek word in these verses is hilasmos, which means 'that which propitiates,' that is, a propitiatory sacrifice
In the Septuagint the Greek translation of the Old Testament hilasterion is the word for the term mercy seat in Exodus 25 and Leviticus 16
The King James Version translates hilaskomai as 'make reconciliation for'; however, it should be translated 'propitiate'
Because of this problem or debt, you have a demand upon me, and unless your demand is satisfied the problem between us cannot be resolved
Herein lies the difference between propitiation and reconciliation: propitiation is for sins; reconciliation is both for sins and enmity
Although the righteousness of God has existed for ages, it was not manifested to us until we believed in the Lord and called on His name
Romans 3:21 says that the righteousness of God has been manifested without law, being witnessed by the law and the prophets
Now without law, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested through faith of Jesus Christ
We believe in Jesus Christ by His faith, and out of this faith and to this faith the righteousness of God is revealed to all who believe
When we believe in the Lord Jesus, we receive the righteousness of God which meets all the requirements of God
In Romans 3 we find that the requirements of God are of two categories: the requirements of His righteousness and His glory
The expiating blood was sprinkled upon the propitiation cover, meeting the requirements of the righteous law and of God's glory
God has set forth Christ Jesus as a propitiation cover , and this propitiation cover is the propitiation place where God can meet with man
Before we knew of this place, we were frightened by the thought of approaching God, but now we are no longer afraid of Him
In this universe the Lord Jesus has been set forth as the propitiation place, and all sinners may come to meet God upon Him
The law has been silenced; it can no longer speak against us, but the glory of God can rejoice over us with satisfaction
During Old Testament times, the sins of the people had not been taken away, but only covered by the expiating blood
God is bound by His righteousness to justify us because of the redemption of Christ which meets all His requirements
God has shown His righteousness to the Old Testament saints in passing by their sins and to the New Testament saints in justifying them
God has one way of dealing with all people, and this one God with His one way brings the different peoples together as one
Among us we have a number of Jewish brothers and sisters, and God has justified them in the same way as He has justified us, the Gentiles
Notice the prepositions the Jews the circumcision are justified out of faith the Gentiles the uncircumcision are justified through faith
We must recognize this and be careful how we refer to the Jews, for God will say of them, 'They are My people'
Whether we are Jewish believers or Gentile believers, we are one Body in Christ under the one economy of the one God
The history of the created race as recorded in Genesis culminates in the building of the tower and city of Babel
The number eight is the number of resurrection, indicating that these people were saved and preserved in resurrection
The giving up of God was not completed before the flood; it was completed afterward by the descendants of Noah, who fell into idolatry
In the English language we have the words sodomy and sodomites, which signify the most shameful acts of fornication
When he was called by God to leave Ur of the Chaldees, he not only brought his wife, but other relatives as well
If we consider what Abraham did, we will realize that we are not the only ones who are not absolute in obeying the Lord's call
Sarah's suggestion was a test to prove that Abraham remained in his old self, that part of him was still the old creation
As far as God was concerned, the created race under the headship of Adam was hopeless, and He gave it up completely
Out of that created and fallen race God called out Abraham to be the father and head of a new race, the called race
When Isaac did not exist and when there was no possibility for him to exist, God declared, 'There shall be an Isaac'
The faith reckoned to Abraham as righteousness did not depend on the outward form of circumcision, because circumcision came later
Abraham received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision
He was the father of the uncircumcision who have the same faith and of the circumcision who walk in the steps of the same faith
Those who have been called and believe in the Lord Jesus, those who have Christ as their faith and as their righteousness
Father God, Thou hast accepted Jesus as our Substitute; Judged the Just One for the unjust, Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?
As a proof of perfect justice, At Thine own right hand He sits; He, as Thy full satisfaction, Righteously Thy need befits
The death of Christ has fully fulfilled and satisfied God's righteous requirements, so that we are justified by God through His death
Not only so but as the resurrected One He is also in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God
When God called Abraham, He did not tell him where he should go, because His intention was to bring Abraham back to Himself
Believing in God means to terminate ourselves and to let God be our very being, to let God be all that we should be
Unconsciously, some element, some essence of the living God is transfused into him, and he reacts to God by believing in Him
At that moment, without your even knowing it, the living Christ in His gospel of glory transfused Himself into you
Faith is not separate from Christ, for it is actually Christ Himself transfusing Himself into us and producing a reaction within us
We do not find this experience in the Bible if we read superficially, but if we probe into the depths of the Scriptures, we find it there
The death of Christ gave us a positional justification, and the resurrected Christ in the heavens is a proof of this
Now the resurrected Christ also lives inside us, reacting within us and living out a life of dispositional justification
Circumcision means to terminate ourselves and to come into God: it terminates us and it germinates God into us
The Jews do not care for the inward reality of circumcision they only care for the outward form the practice of cutting off a piece of flesh
Regardless of who we are or of what situation in which we find ourselves, the general human condition is one of not being
The God in whom our father Abraham believed and in whom we also believe is the God who calls things into existence out of nothing
When Abraham received Isaac back after offering him to God on the altar, he experienced God giving life to the dead
The Apostle Paul did not conclude the section on justification at this point, which is reached at the end of chapter 3
In answering this question, Paul used Abraham's history as an example, as a picture to explain what no human words can explain
If we study the picture in chapter 4, we will realize that it is deeper, more profound, and more far-reaching than chapter 3
In Genesis 1 we are told that God made man in His own image to express Himself and that this man was a corporate man, not an individual man
Once man had turned away from God, had been distracted from God's purpose, and had been occupied with other things, he fell deeply into sin
It was totally involved with God's purpose, with having a seed to produce a kingdom for the fulfillment of God's purpose
Abraham and his heirs must inherit the world for the sake of God's kingdom, and God's kingdom is for His purpose
If we only had Romans 3, we would say that God's justification, based upon Christ's redemption, is for our salvation
From our experiences we can realize that the very righteousness that was reckoned to us at the time we believed was Christ
In this way, we have a genuine experience of the righteousness of God and are justified dispositionally as well as positionally
As you are enjoying your individual Christ, God appears, as He did to Abraham, saying, 'Offer your Isaac to Me'
If you offer your individual Isaac to God, God will react to you once again, and thousands of Isaacs will return to you
During that time, the God of glory transfused some element of His divine being into us, and we believed in Him spontaneously
After that, if someone would have advised us against believing in Christ, we would have found it impossible not to believe in Him
Nothing can take this belief out of us because it is actually the living Christ working in us and reacting to God
Following this, we all determined to do good-to behave ourselves, to love our wives, and to submit to our husbands
God's purpose is to have the one Body, which is the kingdom, to express Him and to exercise His dominion on the earth
Romans 4 lays the foundation for Romans 12-16, where we see the practical Body life, church life, and kingdom life
In Romans 3 Paul alludes to the picture of the ark with its cover as he portrays Christ as the propitiation place
The application of electricity depends on the fuse, and we may say that the power of electricity is applied through the fuse
The heavenly electricity is far away in the heavens, but the place where this electricity must be applied is here on earth
Faith is our reaction toward God, which results from God's transfusing Himself into us and infusing His divine elements into our being
Faith is not a human virtue; it is absolutely a reaction caused by a divine infusion, which saturates and permeates our being
If we change the preposition, the phrase will read 'faith in Jesus' and mean that we believe in Jesus by ourselves
If we study Genesis 11 through 24, including the record in Acts 7, we find that God appeared to Abraham several times
To be attracted simply means that God transfused Himself into Abraham without his realizing it or being conscious of it
After Abraham had spent time in God's presence, He could not help believing in Him, because he had been transfused with God
God's fourth appearing to Abraham was in Genesis 13:14-17, when He told Abraham to lift up his eyes and look in every direction at the land
God had appeared to Abraham repeatedly, and Abraham had experienced the riches of God's appearing, coming to have confidence in them
Although righteousness had been reckoned to Abraham, he had not yet experienced that righteousness in a solid, concrete way
We need to recall Paul's own experience as recounted in Romans 7: 'To will is present with me, but to do is not'
If you determine to honor your parents, love your wife, or submit to your husband, you are turning to the law and marrying Hagar
According to Genesis 17:21, God came to Abraham and said, 'Next year at this time Sarah will bring forth a son'
The correct rendering of this phrase is found in the New American Standard Version, which says, 'Next year at this time'
In the gospel preaching, through the appearing and transfusion of Christ, we reacted to God in believing with Christ as faith
God reckoned this faith back to us as our righteousness, which was a real experience of Christ at the time of our salvation
That was a return of Christ, a further coming of Christ to us after we reacted to God in believing with Him as our faith
We not only have Christ as the righteousness of God reckoned to us, but we have also the experience of Christ as our Isaac
According to Hebrews 11:17-19, Isaac was resurrected, and Abraham received Isaac back from God in resurrection
The church as the kingdom of God is not composed of one Isaac, but of many Isaacs who have proceeded out of God's justification
Man was created to God that he might express God's image and exercise God's dominion for the building up of His kingdom
In Genesis 2 we see that God was represented by the tree of life, indicating that the man created to God should continually eat of this tree
God appeared to call Abraham out of this fallen condition, meaning that God wanted to bring man back to Himself
When God called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees, He did not tell him where to go, because God's intention was to bring him back to Himself
In this way God trained Abraham to be totally transfused, infused, and permeated with God and no longer to act by himself
If we obey this demand, God will react to us once again, giving us an experience of resurrection that produces many Isaacs
Verse 5 speaks of the Holy Spirit, telling us that the Holy Spirit has poured out the love of God into our heart
Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself
From the day we first called on the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit
We only need to stay in a place too long and we will sense that we have moved from the realm of grace into another sphere
We simply confessed our sins to God, received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, applied His blood, and we were justified
Since we have been justified by faith and stand in the realm of grace, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ
Justification by faith is the opening of the gate, giving us an access, an entry into a wide field of enjoyment
As we stand in the realm of grace, and walk the way of peace, we constantly boast, exult, and glory in our God
If we read Romans 5 carefully, we will see that tribulation does not stand on the same level as grace; it is under grace
The six items of love, grace, peace, hope, life, and glory, along with the three Persons of the Godhead all supersede tribulation
Although we love God's grace, we must also kiss the tribulation, which is the incarnation of grace, the sweet visitation of grace
Madame Guyon, on the contrary, kissed each cross, waiting for more to come, because she realized that the cross brought God to her
It is not primarily the experience itself, but the attribute or virtue which is acquired through the experiences of suffering
If your answer is affirmative, the Lord will raise up the circumstances that will produce approvedness for you
We cannot see electricity itself, but the shining of electricity in the lights is the expression, the glory of electricity
We need to be saved in His life from being self-like, that is, to be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God
If we read the book of Romans carefully, we will observe that the section on justification ends with Romans 5:11
Although we may enjoy these six significant items and three wonderful Persons, they are mainly outward and objective
In the section on justification Paul does give some hints to indicate that he will proceed to deal with our inward disposition
Romans 4:24-25 intimates that Christ will come into the justified ones and live in them a life of justification
Prior to Romans 5:10 we were told that we have already been saved, because we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled
The crucified Christ saved us objectively on the cross; the resurrected Christ within us saves us subjectively
Eventually, in Romans 8, the conclusion of the section that deals with our disposition, we see that Christ is in us
Although we are in God and Christ at the time of Romans 5:11, we have not had much experience of God and Christ living within us
Although we are in God boast and joy in God and stand in the realm of grace we have not fully experienced God and Christ dwelling within us
To be in Christ is a positional matter to have Christ in us especially living and dwelling in us is a dispositional and experiential matter
The dispositional matter of Christ living in us is covered in Romans 5:12 through 8:30, the section on sanctification and glorification
As we approach the section on sanctification, we must realize that the gift in Christ surpasses the heritage in Adam
Regardless of whether we are good or bad, as long as we were born of Adam's race we have sin and death as our heritage
Romans 5:14 mentions Adam's transgression, referring to Adam's transgression of eating the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden
After God created Adam, He placed him in front of the tree of life, indicating that Adam should partake of this tree
He forsook the tree of life that denoted God as life and turned to the tree of knowledge that signified Satan as the source of death
Since we have been constituted righteous, we have come up to the standard of God's righteousness and now correspond to it
In Adam, through his one offense, we were condemned unto death; in Christ, through His one righteous act, we are justified unto life
If we had not been constituted sinners, we would have been clean and righteous, with nothing in our being contradicting God's character
Under the blood of Christ, we claim God as our portion, and we receive from God a measure which we do not deserve
Adam's transgression caused and still causes all his descendants to die, but Christ's obedience causes all men to live
We have to know these men, acts, and results, and we also have to know the four reigning things in order to be clear about Romans 5:12-21
The world here refers to mankind in general, for, in a sense, the word world in the New Testament means mankind
Paul said that sin dwelt within him, that the law of sin was in the members of his body, and that in his flesh was nothing good, only sin
Although our body was created by God as good, it became flesh once sin had been injected into it and had made its home there
As we have already seen, the tree of life in the garden denoted God, and the tree of knowledge signified Satan
The result is not something that is material and temporal, but something in the reign of grace that is eternal and divine-God's divine life
Romans 517 says those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One Jesus Christ
Paul said that grace not only 'abounded to the many,' but also that 'grace might reign through righteousness unto life eternal'
As grace reigns unto life, so we who 'receive the abundance of grace shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ'
Romans 5:10 says that we shall be saved in His life, and Romans 1:17 tells us that the just shall have life and live by faith
As we enter the section on sanctification, we find a strong word in Romans 5:17, telling us that we 'shall reign in life'
He is a man with sin in him, a man under the reign of death and, therefore, a man under God's righteous judgment and condemnation
Do not think that you must wait until your death to be judged, for we all were judged in Adam six thousand years ago
The act of Adam is called transgression, offense, and disobedience; the act of Christ is called obedience or a righteous act
As Christ's obedience and righteousness are versus Adam's disobedience and transgression, so also grace is versus sin
In Romans 6:3 Paul says, 'Are you ignorant that as many of us as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
A spiritual transfer must happen in the act of baptism and if we do not have a realization of this we should not touch the matter of baptism
Baptism is an act in which we put the members of Adam into death, thereby transferring them out of Adam and into Christ
Through identification with Christ in His death and resurrection, we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ
God has accomplished the glorious fact of putting us into Christ; we have been crucified and resurrected with Him
We need a vision to see our co-crucifixion with Christ in Romans 6:6-7, and our co-resurrection with Christ in Romans 6:8-10
If we have seen these two aspects of the fact of our identification with Christ, we know that we are dead to sin and alive to God
On the one hand, we must reckon ourselves dead to sin; on the other hand, we must reckon ourselves alive to God
Having seen the facts, we reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God by believing that we have been crucified and resurrected with Christ
Many Christians have been taught the technique of reckoning themselves dead, and many have practiced this technique
It is not a matter of technique; it is a matter of seeing the fact that results in reckoning with a spontaneous faith
Simply using the technique of reckoning according to the doctrinal understanding without seeing the fact will always end in failure
As we reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God, we need to present our members as 'weapons of righteousness to God'
The same Greek word is used in 2 Corinthians 6:7 in the phrase that is translated 'the armor of righteousness'
If we present ourselves to God as slaves and our members as weapons of righteousness, we will be sanctified spontaneously
In this way we give the eternal life the opportunity to work within us, to separate us from everything common, and to sanctify us
Sin has no ground no right to make any claims upon us but instead we standing under grace have the full right to reject sin and its power
Because in 6:14 Paul said, 'you are not under law,' he must write another chapter to explain how we are not under law
Assuming the position of the husband, the fallen man became independent of God and made himself the head as the husband
The first husband of Romans 7:2-3 is not the flesh or the law, but the old man of Romans 6:6, which has been crucified with Christ
Romans 7:3 tells us that if, while the husband lives, the wife marries another husband she will be called an adulteress
We were not put to death as a result of suicide, but through the body of Christ, meaning that we died on the cross of Christ
We need to compare this with Romans 6:6, which says, 'Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him'
No doubt the you that have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ in 74 is the old man who has been crucified with Him in 66
Romans 6:6 says that the old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect
Galatians 2:20 follows by declaring, 'I am crucified with Christ,' a phrase which undoubtedly corresponds to Romans 6:6 and 7:4
We were troubled by the old husband in Romans 7:4 because we did not pay attention to a Christian's dual status
According to our new status, we marry Him who has been raised from among the dead, that we might bear fruit to God
Verse five says For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins which were through the law operated in our members to bear fruit to death
We have seen that Romans 7:4 says that we are married to Christ, 'even Him Who has been raised from among the dead'
To take God as our husband means to terminate all that we are, have, and do and to trust in God for everything
Whenever you try to do anything on your own, it means that you, as the old man once again, are turning to Hagar
In this passage Paul allegorizes Hagar and Sarah as two covenants: Hagar as the covenant of the law and Sarah as the covenant of grace
By this we can understand that Hagar typifies the covenant of law and that Sarah typifies the covenant of grace
In these verses we see a vivid contrast between death and God, between bearing fruit to death and bearing fruit to God
Since the acts of deceiving and killing are certainly the behavior of a person, we must consider sin as the personification of Satan
Since this law is the law of the mind and the mind is a part of our soul, it means that there is a law in our soul
Since this law is in our members and our members are a part of our flesh, our fallen body, it means that in our flesh is another law
In this one verse we find two laws: one is a good law in our mind, and the other is an evil law in our members
It is the death of being defeated, the death of being made captive and carried away by the law of sin in our body
While the law of God is above us and outside of us, making demands upon us, the law of good is in the mind of man's soul
We may say that the law of good in our mind corresponds to the law of God and responds to its demands, trying to keep it
Wives have a similar experience when they try in themselves to keep the law which tells them to submit to their own husbands
Some Christians insist that Romans 7 is necessary, that, experientially speaking, it must come between Romans 6 and Romans 8
The argument among the teachers of the Bible concerns the time when this experience occurred-before or after Paul's salvation
It is not his present experience, because he said that there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus
As regenerated, new men we are no longer under the law, because our old husband, the old man under the law, has been crucified
Although Romans 7 describes Paul's experience before he was saved, it depicts the experience of most Christians after they are saved
After we were saved, this good law in our mind responded to the law of God outside of us, and we made up our mind to be a better person
If he did not make this modification, he would contradict himself, for in the following verse he mentions his will to do good
Although man was created good, the evil nature of Satan was injected into his body when he partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge
Whenever mans mind by the good law thinks to do good the evil law immediately rises up to fight defeat and capture the pitiful wretched man
Paul came to realize that he was a hopeless case due to the powerful element of sin dwelling in his fallen body
The law of good, responding to God's law, is in our mind, and the law of sin is in our members, fighting against the law of good
As a contrast to this school we have Galatians 5:16 which says, 'Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh'
As result of this teaching, men and women began to stay together, claiming that they were spiritual and without lust
The thought here is the same as the thought in Romans 8:13, which says that by the Spirit we put to death the practices of our body
Our old man has been crucified with Christ once for all, but we have to crucify our flesh continually day by day
The warfare in Galatians 5 is the warfare between our flesh and the Spirit, a conflict utterly different from the war described in Romans 7
It is even discussed in some of the old Chinese writings, where it is called the war between the principle and the lust
Before he was saved he was very enthusiastic about God's law, attempting to keep it and to do good in order to please God
Although the Chinese hundreds of years ago did not know the law of God they did understand the good nature of man mentioned in Romans 21415
Is man's good nature, for the Gentiles by nature do the things of the law , showing that the function of the law is written in their hearts
The struggle recorded in Romans 7, regardless of whether it is encountered before or after salvation, is not a typical Christian experience
In every human being, whether or not he has been saved, there is a good element in his mind and an evil element in his body, the flesh
Every person has these two lives-the God-created life which is good, and the satanic life which came into man's body as a result of the fall
On one hand, the Pharisees were the generation of men; on the other hand, they were the generation of poisonous serpents
As long as you are a person who tries to do good you will have the experience of the conflict described in Romans 7
The 'body of sin' means that the body is indwelt, occupied, possessed, and utilized by sin to do sinful things
The 'body of death' means that the body is poisoned, weakened, paralyzed, and deadened, unable to keep the law and to do good to please God
In keeping the law of God or in doing good to please God the body is weak to the uttermost, as if it were dead
The Apostle Paul calls our body 'the body of this death,' that is, the death of trying to keep the law and please God
In such a situation, if man tries to fulfill the law of God as Paul did, man surely will have nothing but failure
After we have been saved, we should make no attempt to fulfill the law of God or to do good in order to please God
Romans 7 reveals the bondage of the law in our flesh, while Romans 8 unveils the freedom of the Spirit in our spirit
He condemned sin in the flesh of Christ by 'sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin'
That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit
For those who are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to spirit, the things of the Spirit'
God condemned sin in the flesh that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk according to spirit
Before we deal with Romans 8 itself, we need to consider a glorious and marvelous term found in 8:2-'the Spirit of life'
The first occurrence of this word life in the book of Romans is in 1:17 which says that the just shall have life and live by faith
Romans 6:22-23 says that eternal life is the end of sanctification and that the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord
Once we receive it, we should be saved in life, reign in life, walk in newness of life, and be sanctified in life
If we walk in the Spirit, we walk in life, but if we do not walk in the Spirit, we do not walk in the newness of life
Paul has told us that the law in our mind is weak and impotent, but that the law in our members is potent and full of strength
His character was so strong that only the Lord Jesus could subdue him, as He did as Paul was on the way to Damascus
God in Christ has passed through a long process-the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
On the Romans 8 table we have the processed God, for here His title is neither Jehovah nor the Almighty God, but the Spirit of life
We all must shout, 'Hallelujah,' because this law which is the spontaneous, divine power is not outside of us, but is in our spirit
Three persons are in us: ourselves in our souls, Satan in our body, and the processed God as the Spirit of life in our spirit
In His creation God was outside of His creatures; in identification He has made us one with Himself by putting us into Himself
The God in creation has passed through redemption, justification, reconciliation, identification, and He is now in our spirit
The God in our spirit is not merely God; He has been processed into the Spirit of life, for the Spirit of life is the processed God
When the son returned home, the father put the best robe on him, a robe signifying Christ as our righteousness for our justification
Divinity, humanity, love, light, life, power, righteousness, holiness, grace-everything we need is in the Spirit
In Romans 7 we see the bondage of the law in our flesh, and in Romans 8 we see the freedom of the Spirit in our spirit
In the book of Romans there are two kinds of condemnation: the outward, objective condemnation and the inward, subjective condemnation
Many Christians, having solved the problem of objective condemnation, have created for themselves the problem of inward condemnation
Paul, after his cry of wretchedness at the end of chapter seven, declared in a victorious way, 'now then no condemnation in Christ Jesus'
In Romans 8 Paul does not say, 'There is no condemnation in Christ Jesus because the blood of Jesus has cleansed me'
We are freed from subjective condemnation, not because of the blood which cleanses us, but because of the law which liberates us
If according to the ancient method of warfare some soldiers were surrounded by enemy troops they would have had to fight their way through
Her husband, who is always nice and gentle with her, on the very morning that she determines to submit to him, is quite mean
Whenever we are surrounded by the enemy we should forget about every attempt of fighting through and say, 'Praise the Lord!
In Christ not in Adam nor in ourselves but in Christ we have the Spirit of life who is Christ Himself as the lifegiving Spirit in our spirit
Because we are in Christ the Spirit of life, who is Christ Himself, dwells in our spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit as one spirit
For once we drift back to our old habitual way of trying to do good we are insulated immediately from the powerful law of the Spirit of life
We must look to the Lord that we may abide in our spirit always so that we may enjoy the freedom of the law of the Spirit of life
The law of God makes its demands, but the bodies of sinners cannot fulfill them because within the body is sin as the weakening factor
Although the body of sin or the flesh of sin is exceedingly weak in keeping the law of God, it is powerful in committing sin
He knew that He should not send His Son to be the flesh of sin, for, if He did that, His Son would have been involved with sin
Satan was bruised, destroyed through the very flesh that Christ put on Himself, because that flesh was in the form of the serpent
Romans 8:3 not only says that God sent His Son 'in the likeness of the flesh of sin,' but also that He sent Him 'concerning sin'
Some versions render 'concerning sin' as 'as an offering for sin,' taking the word sin here to be a reference to the sin offering
Satan's nature, that is, sin, was in the flesh, and Christ put on this flesh in which sin, the nature of Satan, dwelt
Satan was eager and happy to enter into man's body, which became the flesh after he entered it, being glad to have a lodging place
Romans 84 says That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh but according to spirit
The fact that 8:3 ends with a comma indicates that what was accomplished in that verse is for the following verse
In 8:2 he mentions the Holy Spirit and in 8:4 he refers not only to the Holy Spirit, but even the more to the human spirit
If we walk according to this mingled spirit, all the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled spontaneously
For those who are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to spirit, the things of the Spirit'
In Romans 7 the mind goes out to act independently; in Romans 8 the mind returns to rely upon the spirit, no longer acting on its own
In Romans 8 the mind maintains her position as the wife, no longer going out on her own, but always returning to the husband
In chapter eight the mind becomes the proper wife, maintaining her rightful position and returning to rely upon her husband, the spirit
When the mind is set on the spirit, there is no defeat, condemnation, or negative feelings-only life and peace, enjoyment and rest
The very mind that, in itself, is unable to keep the law of God can be a mind of life and peace by being set on the spirit
In both 7:25 and 8:6, the mind, whether it is independent of or dependent upon the spirit, represents the person himself
When the mind is independent of the spirit it means that the person acts on his own, not relying upon the spirit
To have the mind set on the spirit means to have our whole being set on the spirit and to act according to the spirit
In verses 9 and 10 we find three synonymous terms used interchangeably: 'the Spirit of God,' 'the Spirit of Christ,' and 'Christ'
He is the Spirit of life He is the Spirit of God and He is also the Spirit of Christ indwelling us that He may impart Himself as life to us
Romans 87 says Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can it be
The flesh has been thoroughly condemned by God, and we should not remain there, arguing that our flesh has improved
If the Spirit of God can make His home in us, settling Himself in us with adequate room, then we will be in spirit and not in the flesh
If the Spirit of God does not have this room in which to lodge, we will remain in the flesh, not in the spirit
No one can deny that this indicates that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ and that the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God
Verse 10 says, 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
Although God has condemned sin in the flesh, sin continues to dwell in our body, and thus our body is still dead
Never accept a teaching which says that we have become so spiritual and holy that it is impossible for us to sin
The Lord Jesus did accomplish everything on the cross, but the effect of what He did can only be realized by us when we are in the Spirit
Although the sin in our body has been fully dealt with by the cross of Christ, how can we experience this fact?
If we are going to experience all that we have in Christ, we need to be experimentally and experientially in the Spirit
When the prodigal son returned home to his father, he was not qualified to sit down with him and eat the fatted calf
Our body can participate in this life, be sustained with this life, and be supplied with this life through His Spirit who indwells us
Only a small part of our being gives Him a free course; most of our being is not open to Him, but rather frustrates Him
In order to put to death the practices of the body we need to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to spirit
When she comes to the meeting all she can do is keep the form and strive to maintain the image of being a spiritual sister
As long as you have rest, comfort, and satisfaction within, it is an indication that your mind is set in the right direction
If you have no rest comfort or satisfaction but rather feel dark empty and restless it is an indication that your direction is toward death
The genuine experience of the co-crucifixion with Christ is to be had in the putting to death of the practices of the body by the Spirit
Every practice of the body must be put to death by turning our mind to the spirit and setting it on the spirit
As God deals with us, He always cares for three of His divine attributes-His righteousness, holiness, and glory
In the second stage we are in the process of sanctification, a process in which God works His divine nature into us
Although we have obtained and participated in God's righteousness outwardly, God's holiness needs to be wrought into us inwardly
Now, as the Spirit of life in our spirit, He is spreading Himself from our spirit into our soul-into our mind, emotion, and will
Through this saturation God works Himself with His holy nature into our entire being, into our spirit, soul, and body
If we continue to cooperate, this saturating and spreading One will spread Himself from our spirit even into our mortal body
Now we can understand why Paul wrote Romans in the order that he did, with justification first, followed by sanctification and glorification
These three sections cover the three stages of complete salvation and correspond to the three parts of our being
In justification our spirit is made alive, in sanctification our soul is made life, and in glorification even our body will be full of life
From the beginning of the book of Romans through 8:13 two main things are covered, justification and sanctification
In the second stage, sanctification, God is working Christ into us to make Him our sanctification subjectively
It is by this life that Christ permeates us, saturates us, and infuses the holy nature of God into us, making us holy dispositionally
In other books of the Bible we find mention of sanctification by the blood and are told that the blood of Christ has sanctified us
The essence of His human nature, His humanity, is flesh; the essence of His divinity is the Spirit of holiness
Although we have been justified we still need to have life that we might be sanctified that is have Gods holy nature wrought into our being
Paul says, 'Those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ'
In 5:21 Paul says that 'grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord'
Romans 64 says that as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life
6:5 reads, 'For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we should also grow in the likeness of His resurrection'
When we preach the gospel to people in an adequate and living way, the living Christ will be transfused into them
Afterward, the new convert must grow together with Christ in the likeness of His resurrection, that is, 'in newness of life'
Hagios is translated holy in 1:2; 5:5; 7:12; 9:1; 11:16; 12:1; 14:17; 15:13, 16; 16:16, and saints in 1:7; 8:27; 12:13; 15:25, 26, 31; 16:15
Sanctification is the practical effect produced, the character and activity, and the resultant state of being sanctified
But now, having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life'
The law of the Spirit of life has freed us not for justification; it has freed us mainly that we might be sanctified
The mind set on the spirit is life mainly for sanctification, for saturation in life with the holy nature of God
And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
Inwardly, we need to let Christ, the life-giving Spirit, make His home in our heart that He may impart life into our body
Paul even says in 15:16 'that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit'
The nations, the Gentiles, including many who were idol worshippers and sodomites, will be dispositionally sanctified with God's nature
In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul covers these three things in one sentence, but in the book of Romans he takes eight chapters to expound them
In order to possess His righteousness four items are necessary-propitiation, redemption, justification, and reconciliation
We must remember the definitions of these four terms and the difference between them which we covered in message five
After working objectively to give us His righteousness, God is now working subjectively to impart His holiness into us
All real Christians have been born as children of God, but they need to grow into sanctification that they may look like the sons of God
Now He is working within us that we may be sanctified, that His holy nature may be fully wrought into our being
We have seen that His life is fourfold: it is life in the Divine Spirit, in our human spirit, in our mind, and in our mortal body
The concept of 'children of God' is only brought in at this point, proving that Paul wrote the book of Romans with a deep purpose in view
We may be a child of God without the growth of a son of God, or a son of God without the qualification for an heir
Verse 14 continues Paul's thought by saying that as many as are led by the Holy Spirit, or by the Spirit of God, are the sons of God
By means of this short sentence Paul turns the whole concept from that of the sanctified ones to that of the sons of God
The Lord said further that in the resurrection we would neither marry nor be given in marriage, but would be as the angels of God
For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father'
Romans 8:15 says that we 'have received a spirit of sonship'; Galatians 4:6 says that 'God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son' into us
Verse 15 mentions a spirit of sonship in which we cry Abba Father but in Galatians 46 it says that the Spirit of His Son cries Abba Father
According to grammar, the subject of crying in verse 15 is 'we,' but in Galatians 4:6 the subject of crying is 'the Spirit'
When these two terms 'Abba' and 'Father' are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate
Regardless of how young or new you may be, if you are a child of God, the Spirit of God witnesses with your spirit
If it said 'in our spirit,' it would mean that only the Spirit of God witnesses, but that our spirit does not witness
When our spirit witnesses, that is also the witnessing of the Spirit, because the two spirits have been mingled together as one
By that sense and consciousness we can know the life within us, and by this sense of life we can know that we are walking rightly
The leading of the Spirit in verse 14 does not depend on outward things; it absolutely depends upon the sense of life within our spirit
Perhaps after you have parked your automobile and while you are walking toward the door of the department store you have no peace within
The divine life within us leads us constantly, not by signs or indicators, but by giving us an inward sense, feeling, or consciousness
The donkey was led to speak in a human tongue, but this did not indicate that it had a human life, much less that it was a son of God
When you sisters are about to go to a department store, although everything may be clear outwardly, you need to obey the inner sense of life
You do not hear an audible word, but you have the sense of darkness, weakness, and dryness as you are about to enter the store
If you walk according to the spirit and set your mind on the spirit, you will find that you have the leading of the Spirit
You should not violate this inner sense or disobey this inward consciousness, for it is truly the leading of the Spirit
While your classmates are talking in a worldly way, you may find yourself, at a certain point, unable to join in the conversation
Your classmates may be discussing sinful things in a happy, excited way, but the divine life within you does not allow you to say a word
The inward life constantly gives us a sensation or consciousness that we should not behave ourselves like worldly people do
Since the leading of the Spirit is a matter of life, it should continue normally in every aspect of our daily walk
We may be God's children, but we do not have the growth which comes by living and walking according to the leading of the Spirit in life
As long as we have the witness of the Spirit with our spirit, we have the assurance that we are the children of God
The condition for being heirs of God and joint-heirs of Christ is that 'we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him'
The more suffering we pass through, the more our glory will be intensified, for suffering increases the intensity of our glory
We all will shine and we all will be glorified, but the intensity of our glory will depend on the amount of suffering we are willing to take
In that day there will be no need to make the declaration, 'From now on we are the sons of God,' because we all shall be glorified
The entire creation is waiting for this with watching eyes, for the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God
Verse 20 continues, 'For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him Who subjected it'
When we are brought into that freedom or kingdom of glory, creation will be delivered from vanity, corruption, and slavery
Since our body belongs to the old creation and has not yet been redeemed, we are groaning in it as the creation does
If you talk with unbelievers, they will admit that, in a sense, they have some enjoyment in their entertainments, like dancing and gambling
We, on the contrary, as we are groaning, have within us the Spirit as the firstfruit, as the foretaste of God Himself
In verse 24 Paul says, 'For we have been saved in hope; but hope that is seen is not hope; for what anyone sees, why does he also hope'?
In like manner' includes all the points of the foregoing verses-expecting, eagerness, groaning, endurance, hope, and so forth
Do not think that the Holy Spirit is so different from us that when we receive the Holy Spirit we will be extraordinary people
They said, 'The man Jesus of Nazareth, a prophet mighty in deed and word, has been condemned to death and crucified'
Verse 27 says that 'He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit because He intercedes for the saints according to God'
In this portion of Romans we are told that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God
According to ancient law, heirs had to be of age and declared the legal heirs that they might claim the inheritance
In this portion of Romans we have children by regeneration, sons by transformation, and heirs by transfiguration or glorification
The procedure which makes us legal heirs is the transfiguration of our body, that is, the redemption of our body, the full redemption
In this message we have seen a sketch of the three stages of the making of God's sons: regeneration, transformation, and glorification
We should not expect to be glorified without firstly growing in life and being conformed to the image of God's Son
If we expect to be raptured without growing in life, we are dreamers, for rapture is actually our transfiguration and glorification
Suppose a college freshman dreams that he completes his education in one night and that he will graduate the next morning
After he has finished all of his courses and passed all of his examinations, he will be approved for graduation
In the mid-1930's he printed an article which included two photographs, one of Caesar Nero and the other of Mussolini
In the New Testament the rapture is likened to a harvest, and a harvest is possible only after the crop has matured and ripened
We must realize that glorification with transfiguration depends upon our growing in life until we reach maturity
And if children, heirs also; heirs of God and joint-heirs of Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him'
The suffering mentioned in verse 17 does not only concern outward glorification; suffering is also for growth in life
Even the sunshine itself is a source of suffering, for the scorching heat of the sun burns the crop into ripeness
As Paul says in verse 18, 'the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us'
And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose'
Because whom He foreknew He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son that He should be the firstborn among many brothers
Paul does not say that God foreknew and predestined us to go to a happy place or to have a life that will endure forever
We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's Son that He may be the firstborn among many brothers
When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique, but God desired to have many sons who will be the many brothers of His Son
Without the many sons God could never have a kingdom, and without the many brothers Christ could never have a Body
Why does God arrange our environment, surroundings, and situations in such a way that we experience suffering?
We should not explain this according to our natural concept saying The whole earth is filled with sufferings and everyone undergoes hardship
There is no doubt that growth comes from inward nourishment, but this inner nourishment needs the coordination of the outward environment
Sometimes parents do things to their children which, according to the feeling of the children, are not positive
Some young mothers have been cheated by the weeping of their children, changing their policy when they see the tears of their little ones
Was it you who planned into which family you would be born and which parents and brothers and sisters you would have?
When unpleasant things happen to us we may not understand that they come from the hand of our Father for our growth
The Holy Spirit groans in your groaning in order that you may be fully molded and conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son
Although we did not dare say this, we had such a purpose within us, a purpose which we could not express at that time
We may be separated from everything common and saturated with God's holy nature, but still lack this conformity
We cannot avoid the process mentioned in the previous message, for it is the purpose of the Holy Spirit's intercession with groanings
When the sufferings come, do not be disappointed; accept them and continue to pray, 'Father, if possible take this away
Verse 32 says He Who did not spare His own Son but delivered Him up for us all how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things
It is Christ Jesus Who died, but rather Who was raised, Who is even at the right hand of God, Who also intercedes for us'
In verse 10 we see clearly that Christ is in us, but here in verse 34 we are told that Christ is at the right hand of God
According to verse 26 the Spirit intercedes within us, and according to verse 34 Christ intercedes for us at the right hand of God
And whom He predestinated these He also called and whom He called these He also justified and whom He justified these He also glorified
We may also say 'called'; however, many people have not yet been called and we must preach the gospel to them that they may be called
Tell me, if glorification has not been accomplished, how could the Apostle John have seen the New Jerusalem nineteen hundred years ago?
According to our feeling, glorification will happen in the future, but according to God's concept it has occurred already
We ourselves, 'having the firstfruit of the Spirit,' also groan as we expect sonship, the redemption of our body
In verse 24 Paul says that 'we have been saved in hope; but hope that is seen is not hope; for what anyone sees, why does he also hope'?
Chapter 52 says that we boast in hope of the glory of God and 923 says that we are vessels of mercy which He had before prepared unto glory
As it is written, For Your sake we are being put to death all day long, we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter'
Because He loves us and because we are His beloved, sooner or later we all shall be sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified
Righteousness is the way of God, holiness is the nature of God, glory is the expression of God, and love is the heart of God
Paul touched upon this love in 5:8 when he said that 'God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us'
He waited until he had compassed the vast scope of God's predestination, calling, justification, and glorification
After finishing the entire record he reached the appropriate time and place to present us a full revelation of the love of God
Since the love of God is in Christ Jesus everything is insured, and we are assured that nothing can separate us from it
The Apostle Paul has brought us through the righteousness of God the holiness of God and the glory of God into the heart of the God of love
We may consider chapters nine through eleven as a parenthesis and chapter twelve as a continuation of chapter eight
These three chapters, in a sense, are a parenthesis, but, in another sense, they form a continuation between Romans 8 and 12
Since the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit and our conscience witnesses with the Holy Spirit, our conscience must be part of our spirit
Many times we have an intense desire for a certain thing and that desire causes us to utter a prayer in an extreme way
He prayed with a great desire that God would put him aside and make him a curse that his brothers might be saved
Who are Israelites, whose are the sonship, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service, and the promises'
Verse 5 says, 'Whose are the fathers, and out of whom according to flesh is the Christ, Who is over all, God blessed forever
These verses unveil to us the fact that God's selection is not according to man's work, but absolutely according to His choice
You may think that there was nothing good about Jacob, that he was altogether a subtle, crafty person, and that Esau was much better than he
Our concept is that the one who wills will get what he wills to get and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after
If we do know God's mercy, we will not put our trust in our effort; neither will we be disappointed by our failure
Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor'?
We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers, vessels of honor to express what He is in glory
It is also our destiny according to His selection, a destiny which will be fully revealed in the New Jerusalem
Verses 25 and 26 are quotations from Hosea which confirm the fact that some Gentiles have been selected and called by God to be His people
That the nations who did not pursue righteousness have attained righteousness, but righteousness which is out of faith'
The Israelites sought to establish their own righteousness, but stumbled at the 'Stone of stumbling,' which is Christ, the 'Rock of offense'
For they being ignorant of Gods righteousness and seeking to establish their own righteousness did not submit to the righteousness of God
The result of Christ's terminating the law is that God's righteousness is given to everyone who believes in Christ
They would never again have tried to establish their own righteousness before God, but would have taken Christ as their righteousness
Romans 10 unfolds so much of Christ that we may know how to participate in and enjoy Him as our real and living righteousness before God
The righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?
Apparently these verses do not mention the incarnation and resurrection of Christ; actually both are included in this portion
Although Paul did not use the words incarnation and resurrection, he nevertheless had both of them in mind when he wrote this part of Romans
To 'descend into the abyss' means 'to bring Christ up from among the dead,' and this refers to Christ's resurrection
When Christ died He descended into the abyss, and in resurrection He was brought up from among the dead, that is, out of the abyss
He was God incarnated to be a man, and, as a man, He was transfigured through resurrection into the life-giving Spirit
Now in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit He is so available to us that we may receive Him and take Him in at any time and in any place
For Acts 2:24, 27 reveals that Christ went into hades after He died and rose from that place in His resurrection
He is so available that whoever believes in Him with his heart and calls on Him with his mouth will partake of Him
The result of believing with the heart is righteousness, while the result of confessing with the mouth is salvation
In Romans 9:21, 23 we are told that under God's selection we, the called ones, have been made vessels of mercy unto honor and glory
We also must use it with verse 12, not for gospel preaching, but for filling up all the empty vessels with the riches of the Godhead
We have a mouth to call on Him that we may be filled with Him, and we have a heart to believe in Him and to retain Him
In Psalm 50:15 the Lord asks us to call upon Him in the day of trouble, and in Psalm 86:7 David did it accordingly
In order to take the cup of salvation, that is, to participate and enjoy the Lord's salvation, we need to call upon the name of the Lord
Lamentations 35557 makes it clear that when we call upon the Lord He draws near to us and that our calling upon Him is our breathing our cry
Today in resurrection the Lord is ready and available for our participation in Him and He is rich for our enjoyment of Him
Although it is possible to pray to the Lord silently, calling on the Lord requires that we cry out to Him or address Him audibly
According to the Scripture record, this matter of calling on the name of the Lord began with the third generation of mankind
In Joel 2:32, Zephaniah 3:9, and Zechariah 13:9 it is prophesied that people will call on the name of the Lord
God poured out His Spirit, and the believers opened their mouths to receive the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord
In addressing his first epistle to the church at Corinth Paul said, 'All that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord'
In his second epistle to Timothy Paul charged him to pursue spiritual things 'with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
Corinthians opens with calling on the name of the Lord, revealing that it is a book of the enjoyment of the Lord
When we call on the name of the Lord, we breathe Him in as the breath of life and we drink of Him as the water of life
Those who are sent by God preach the glad tidings that people may hear, believe, call upon the name of the Lord and be saved
The resurrected Christ is the living Word, which is the Spirit; He is like the air, the breath, that we take into our being
All we need to do is exercise our mouth to breathe Him in, our heart to receive Him, and our spirit to retain Him
In order to do this we need to open ourselves from the depths of our being and call upon Him with our mouth from deep within our spirit
In chapter nine we have the vessels and in chapter ten we are given the way to have the vessels filled with the riches of Christ
If we did not have Romans 11, we would certainly think that God, after having chosen Israel, must have changed His mind
God told Elijah not to accuse the people before Him because He had reserved to Himself seven thousand men who had not bowed the knee to Baal
That which Israel is seeking for he has not obtained, but those who were chosen have obtained it, and the rest were hardened'
Verse 8 says, 'As it is written, God gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes to see not and ears to hear not, until this very day'
Some people have eyes, but their eyes have lost their sight; some have ears, but their ears have lost their function
And David says, Let their table become a snare and a trap and a cause of falling and a just retribution to them'
For if their casting aside is the reconciliation of the world, what will be their receiving back but life from among the dead'?
Now if the dough offered as the firstfruit is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, so are the branches
According to Numbers 15:18-21, God told Israel that after they had entered the land they had to offer the first piece of dough to the Lord
That piece of dough was termed the firstfruit, and the phrase 'the dough offered as the firstfruit' in Romans 11:16 is a reference to it
The three patriarchs were and still are the root of God's cultivated olive tree , and all of their descendants are the branches
In Romans 9 the chosen ones of God are likened to clay and in Romans 11 they are likened to a lump of flour used for making cakes
We have seen that the clay vessels in Romans 9 are filled by calling on the name of the Lord as revealed in Romans 10
In verse 22 of that chapter we are told that the seekers of the Lord need to call upon Him out of a pure heart
In verse 17 Paul says that we, the Gentiles, 'being a wild olive tree, were grafted and became a partaker of the root'
For the branch of a wild tree to be grafted into a cultivated tree is for it to receive the life of the cultivated tree
It is not a matter for us Gentiles to change our religion, but to receive the life of the root, which life is Christ
Many Gentiles have turned from their heathen religions to the Christian religion without ever receiving the life of Christ
And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again
Although Paul seems to be speaking on behalf of the Gentiles, he is actually more in favor of the Jews because he was a Jew himself
According to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but according to the selection they are beloved for the fathers' sake'
All things came into being out of God in the past, all things exist through Him in the present, and all things will be to Him in the future
For the practice of life we need transformation, for we can never have the proper practice of life in our natural life
Many so-called spiritual Christians truly love the Lord and pursue the growth of life according to Romans 6 and 8
When we listen to someone speak we always wait for his concluding word, and the concluding word in the book of Romans concerns the church
If you stop at chapter eight you will miss a great deal, separating yourself from the final word of Paul's discourse
Praise the Lord that Paul was so strong and rich in the matter of the church that he took five chapters to emphasize it
In Romans Paul does not present the church life in a doctrinal way, but in a very experiential and practical way
If you think this way, it proves that you still hold a natural concept in understanding this portion of the Bible
The transformation in life is for the practice of life, and the practice of life is conducted mainly in the church life
Transformation does not merely denote a change; it means that a substance is changed both in nature and in form
In the process of metabolism an organic element filled with vitamins comes into our being and produces a chemical change in our organic life
When His life, which is organic and filled with vitamins, permeates our being, a spiritual, chemical compound is formed
It is absolutely an inward metabolic change in our organic element, a change in life and with life by the Lord Spirit
After passing through several chapters and coming to the end of Romans 8, we have been sanctified and conformed as sons of God
The first eight chapters of Romans unfold the life process which brings us all the way from sinners to sons of God
At the beginning of Romans 12, Paul is prepared to tell us how to practice the very life in which we have been and are being processed
There is the need for the real recovery of the Body life that the Lord may have His church built on the earth today in a practical way
Many Christians do not have the riches of life and are unable to function at all simply because they are detached from the Body
It is a sad thing that today very few Christians have seen the corporate life or are willing to pay attention to it
Most of the seeking Christians devote their full attention to Romans 8, pursuing the experiences of the Spirit of life
To be redeemed, to be justified, to be sanctified, and to be conformed to Christ -all are for us to have the proper corporate life
Simply to be sanctified individually or to be spiritual in an individualistic way is not God's way of sanctification and spirituality
May the Lord have mercy upon us that we may see this and practice it by the experiences of sanctification in the Spirit of life
In 12:1 Paul speaks in a begging way, revealing the importance of the matter concerning which he is about to charge us
When they come to chapter twelve to offer themselves as a sacrifice to God, they are a living offering filled with the Spirit of life
The words 'present' and 'sacrifice' mentioned above indicate that the 'reasonable service' is a priestly service
If we have a sober mind and if we intend to be reasonable, fair, and logical, then we certainly must have the church life
To practice anything other than the church life is foolish, but to give up everything for the church life is logical and reasonable
To spend two dollars on a worldly item or amusement is foolish, but to spend two million dollars on the church life is reasonable
The wife of the leading brother in this little church loved the Lord very much and she served us food three times a day
Near the end of his message unable to restrain himself any longer he turned to the sister and said If you keep on sleeping Ill kick you out!
Sixty years ago, especially in the Western world, it was common for women to arrange their hair into a high tower, the higher the better
A person who is possessed by the modern age may attend the Sunday meetings, but he cannot practice the church life
If we intend to practice the church life, we need to experience such a transformation in our soul by the renewing of our mind
Do not apply the mention of the will of God in 12:2 to your personal human situation, to the matters of marriage, employment, or housing
The house that you purchase, the job that you have, and the person that you marry should all depend on the church life
The presenting of our bodies, the transforming of our souls, and the renewing of our minds are all for the Body life
If we are to have the proper church life, the first thing that must be torn down is the high opinion that we have of ourselves
Your mind needs to be adjusted and renewed, and all the negative elements in it need to be swallowed up by the life of Christ
That is the faith which God has allotted to you, and you need to consider yourself soberly according to that measure
If we do not cooperate with each other, then we are detached members, and the Body life cannot be practically realized
When it says in verse 5 that we 'are severally members one of another,' the word 'severally' does not mean separately; it means differently
These gifts differ according to the divine element which we have enjoyed and which we have assimilated into our being
Romans 5:17 says that 'those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life'
In 5:21 Paul says that 'grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord'
In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, 'I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me'
He labored more than the other apostles, although actually it was not Paul himself, but the divine life which he enjoyed
Many Christians seem to think that the only gifts are speaking in tongues, interpretation, healing, and miracles
Grace is not outward; it is the element of the divine life that is wrought into our being inwardly and which gives us some skill or ability
Some brothers receive the revelation given in that prophesying, take it back with them to their locality, and teach others according to it
Based upon the direct speaking under God's inspiration and the teaching according to this inspiration, some others may exhort
We need many saints with such a measure of life that they may have the giving gift and be able to give in simplicity
Based upon this inspired speaking we may have teaching, and based upon both prophesying and teaching we may have exhortation
In addition, we have those that are able to give material things to the church, care for the needy, and further the Lord's work
As you enjoy God as life and grow in life, you find that, corresponding to your growth in life, you have a certain skill or ability
Do not think that after being saved a short while you can pray for several hours receive the socalled baptism and suddenly become an elder
Your growth in life gives you a certain measure of life, and out of that measure of life your skill or gift will be manifested
If you neglect the gifts of grace in life and concentrate on the miraculous gifts, the church will be divided in a very short time
Paul was very experienced in the Body life and he knew that the gifts of grace in life are necessary for the building of the church
Even in 1 Corinthians we can see the fact that speaking in tongues and the other miraculous gifts had a divisive effect on the church
Paul was both wise and careful, recognizing the fact that the miraculous gifts were helpful to individual Christians
In 1 Corinthians Paul said that speaking in tongues builds up the individual who exercises it, but that it does not build up the church
In the book of Romans his concern was not the building up of a particular individual, but the building up of the Body
From Ephesus he wrote his first letter to the Corinthians adjusting them for the abuse of the miraculous gifts
Remember that he wrote the book of Romans from Corinth, the scene of confusion and abuse regarding miraculous gifts
At that time Corinth was the hot bed of miraculous gifts, yet Paul did not say a word about miraculous gifts in the book of Romans
Before Paul talked about the gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, he spoke strongly about the growth in life in chapter three
All the materials that are necessary for the building of God's house are the product of the growth on the farm
Paul said that as a wise masterbuilder he laid the foundation and that we all need to be careful how we build thereupon
Few of the organs can function at the time of birth because the child lacks the necessary measure of growth in life
After a certain length of time, the child will be able to walk and after another period of time, he will be able to speak
Eventually, he will be fully grown, and all of his talents will have been completely cultivated for practical use
When he has matured, he will have the required skills, and these skills are the gifts that come out of the growth in life
In verse 9 Paul says, 'Let love be without hypocrisy,' and in verse 10 he says, 'Love one another warmly in brotherly love'
We cannot put together people with stone faces and call it the church life; we must be living stones, stones full of affection
Paul admonishes us saying, 'Be of the same mind toward one another, not minding high things, but being led away to the lowly
Verse 11 describes the way we should be toward God: 'Not slothful in zeal; burning in spirit; serving the Lord as a slave'
For the Body life, we need a body that is presented, a mind that is renewed in the transformation of the soul, and a spirit that is burning
Suppose, by the Lord's mercy, our body has been presented and our mind has been renewed, but our spirit remains cold
We need to be this kind of person for the Body life, serving the Lord as slaves and having no freedom to do things according to ourselves
In addition to all this, as God's holy people, we must abhor and conquer the evil things and cleave to the good things
We Christians, who are separated unto God, must maintain the highest standard of behavior, a standard above that of moral and ethical people
Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men because the other parties are not willing to have a life of peace
Since we are not only living before God but also before men, we need to take forethought for things honorable in the sight of men
Corinthians 8:21 says, 'We take forethought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men'
Therefore he who resists the authority opposes what God has appointed, and those who oppose will receive to themselves judgment'
In verse 5 Paul says that 'it is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath, but also because of conscience'
We need the Holy Spirit to work in us and to give us an amount of transformation in life that we may practice love toward all men
In order to love people and spontaneously fulfill the commandments, we need the life supply and the transformation in life
In other words, this refers to the redemption of our body, or, to use another term, the full sonship revealed in 8:19, 21, and 23
Let us walk becomingly as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in immorality and debauchery, not in strife and jealousy'
There it is the evil law in our flesh warring against the good law in our mind; it has nothing to do with the Spirit
The flesh is hungry and desires food, but we must starve it to death, making no provision that will allow it to fulfill its lusts
If it does not actually belong to the portion on the living of a normal life, it is at least closely associated with it
In the first eleven chapters Paul completely covers justification, sanctification, glorification, and selection
In Romans 1 through 11 we have seen God's creation, man's fall, Christ's redemption, God's justification, and God's reconciliation
Many Christians uplift sanctification and life, but seem to cast the church behind their back, not caring for it, and even opposing it
Nearly two thousand years ago the Lord Jesus promised that He would soon return; yet He has not come because the church is not ready
His coming back requires two things: the restoration of the nation of Israel and the recovery of the church life
If you understand prophecy, you will realize that these two matters are the greatest signs of the Lord's return
Once we undergo this kind of metabolic transformation in our whole being, we shall be good for the church life
Once our body has been presented and our soul transformed by the renewing of our mind, our spirit needs to be burning
If we have all of these qualities, we shall see out of the growth in life the manifestation of the gifts of grace in life
In order to practice the church life, we need to have a normal Christian daily life, a life which matches the church life
We need to have our body presented, our soul transformed, our mind renewed, our spirit burning, and our gifts exercised
Transformation governs the items found in chapter thirteen as well as some of the aspects of chapters fourteen and fifteen
Most of the receiving of the believers in Christianity is not according to God's receiving, but according to doctrinal concepts
It would take us months to cover all the differing doctrinal concepts, such as eternal security, predestination, free will, rapture, etc
There is much argument even about this as people debate the size, color, and thickness of the material used as a covering
Some people criticize us and find fault with us because we do not agree with all of their opinions regarding doctrine
We have learned this lesson after a thorough study of church history and we do not want to repeat the tragedy of the history of Christianity
The Lord's recovery is for Christ as life and for the church as the expression of Christ in unity in each locality
Some dear saints, after claiming to see the church, continued to hold to their particular doctrinal understanding
If we do not take heed to this warning, we shall use doctrine as a knife to cut in pieces the very Body revealed in chapter twelve
Paul, after revealing the proper church life and the normal Christian life, takes up the crucial point of receiving the believers
His religious nature forced God to give him the same revelation three times regarding what is sanctified and what is common
Some believers are weak in faith because they have not yet received much of the transfusing and infusing of the element of God into them
Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him
When people ask you about the method of baptism or the kind of water used, you should not get into a doctrinal argument
The best way to reply to doctrinal questions is to help people to turn themselves from doctrinal concepts to Christ who is our life
For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself; for whether we live, we live to the Lord, or if we die, we die to the Lord
All have been born of the same Lord regardless of the way in which they have been baptized, of the food they eat, or the days they observe
If, on the other hand, we begin to argue about doctrine, we shall soon be divided according to our various concepts
As long as God the Father has received us all and as long as we believe in the Lord and live to Him, we should receive one another
For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works'
It is not the loss of our salvation, for Paul says of the man whose work is burned that 'he himself shall be saved'
Because Christians are not clear about the pure Word of God, there are the two major schools of Calvinism and Arminianism
According to the Calvinist school, once you are saved you are eternally saved, and there will be no problems in the future
According to the Arminian school, it is possible to be lost again if you do not live and work uprightly after you are saved
These two schools represent two extremes, and neither school has found the bridge in the Bible which spans the gap between them
When the Lord returns, He will gather all His servants before Him and have them give an account to Him of their life and work
Although we are saved eternally, we must still give an account to the Lord of our life and work at the judgment seat of Christ
In this message we need to consider some more points concerning the matter of transformation in receiving the believers
Please remember that Romans was written shortly after Paul had written 1 Corinthians, and that he wrote Romans from Corinth
Paul devoted 1 Corinthians 13 to the matter of love, inserting it between the two chapters that deal with spiritual gifts
In verse 18 the Lord said, 'I will build my church,' and in verse 19 He said, 'I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven'
The church is a matter of grace and life, whereas the kingdom is a matter of exercise in this age and discipline in the coming age
If you look at the back of my head, you do not see any holes; however, if you look at the front, you will see seven of them
In the church, on the one hand we enjoy grace and experience life, while on the other hand we undergo a certain amount of exercise
On the one hand the church is a family a home that is full of grace and life on the other hand the church is a kingdom a government to rule
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, our peace toward others, and our joy with God
If we cannot say, 'Hallelujah, praise the Lord,' every day, it means that we are defeated and are not in the Holy Spirit
In verse 18 Paul says, 'For he who in this serves Christ as a slave is well-pleasing to God and approved by men'
The things that build up one another are the things that minister life to the members of the Body for the mutual building
We have to seek after the things that keep the unity of the Body with peace and the things that minister life to others
If we cause any of the believers to stumble by our doctrinal concepts, we break down, destroy, God's work of grace in him
We must take care of the building of the brothers in life, not the keeping of our religious concepts in knowledge
He who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not out of faith, for all which is not out of faith is sin'
We have to take care of the ones weaker in faith, not causing them to do anything about which they do not have faith
If we are not in the spirit as we read this portion of Romans, we will miss much of the depth of what Paul wrote
Romans 15:1 says, 'Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak, and not to please ourselves'
In receiving the believers, we have to do the same according to Him, not pleasing ourselves, but bearing others' weaknesses
For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me'
Christ did not please Himself; He pleased the Father by bearing the reproaches which should have fallen upon the Father
We should not please ourselves; we should please others by bearing their weaknesses that they may be built up in the Body of Christ
Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus'
If we receive its instruction, we will be supplied with the endurance and encouragement of Christ that we may have hope
We also need to be encouraged with the hope that they may improve and be empowered in faith by the Lord's grace
If we are so encouraged by such a God, we shall be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus, not according to anything else
Since there is only one Christ Jesus, if we are all according to Christ, we shall be likeminded with one another
If our mind is in accordance with teachings, concepts, gifts, religious practices, or any other such thing, we shall be divided
Verse 6 says, 'That you may with one accord and with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ'
If, in receiving the believers, we behave ourselves according to the Lord Jesus, we shall glorify God as He does
Our receiving of the believers must be according to God's and Christ's receiving, not according to anything else
He has become a servant of the Jews for the sake of the truth of God, to confirm the promises given to their fathers
Verse 9 says that He is not only a servant for the circumcision, but 'for the nations to glorify God for His mercy'
And again, Isaiah says, There shall be the root of Jesse, even He Who arises to rule the nations; in Him the nations will hope'
Never say, 'This is an American, that is a Britisher, that is a German, that is a Japanese, that is a Filipino, and that is a Korean
In receiving the saints, we must likewise be all-embracing, receiving people from the East, West, South, and North
If we receive the saints in this way, we shall receive the Lord's blessing with hope, joy, and peace in believing
Although Paul has covered so much, in this section of Romans he shows us some experiential and practical matters
As we shall see, in this section Paul tells us of his zeal in preaching the gospel and of his desire to visit Spain
In 16:5 we find mention of 'the church in their house,' meaning that the church in Rome met in the house of Prisca and Aquila
God will crush Satan beneath the feet of the 'churching' people, and the grace of the Lord Jesus will be dispensed into them
Paul was a minister of Christ, a public servant serving people with Christ, ministering Christ into the Gentile believers
All the people at this dining table were filled with Christ, and Christ became the transforming element within their being
The Gentiles were transformed with the essence of the wonderful, all-inclusive Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit
We must minister Christ to them in order that Christ might become within them the sanctifying element to change their very being
In 15:16 Paul says that 'the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit'
Once they were unclean and defiled people, but now they are sanctified and have become an offering pleasing to God
Formerly, in the eyes of the Jews, the Gentiles were swine; now they have become saints, a fragrant offering to God
15:29 unfolds Paul's relationship with a third party: the believers in Rome whom he hoped to see on his way to Spain
Paul could go anywhere to share the fullness of the blessing of Christ because he had the full experience of it
As we travel among the churches, let us not take with us doctrines and gifts, but the fullness of the blessing of Christ
It is not only a matter of giving material things, although such communication is a true expression of the reality of Christ
If we have the reality of Christ, we shall pour ourselves out as an expression of our love toward the needy saints
Paul was very wise, giving us a picture of the proper practice of the church life in experience, not in doctrine
When he came to people with the fullness of the blessing of Christ, it meant that he came to them ministering all the riches of Christ
In 16:1 Paul says, 'I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea'
Paul held her in such high esteem that in the following verse he said that 'she has been a patroness of many and of myself as well'
A patroness is one who stands beside you, serves you, nourishes and cherishes you, and cares for all your needs
If we mean business with the Lord in the church life, we also need to serve the church and care for it regardless of the cost
Prisca and Aquila did not count their own lives as dear to them; they were willing to care for the churches at the cost of their own lives
He wrote with a definite purpose, indicating that if we truly love the Lord's church, we need to risk our lives for it
Although it is right to be located by the Lord in a specific place, our heart should be wide and broad enough to embrace all the churches
The third mention of the church is in 16:5, where Paul says 'greet the church in their house,' referring to the house of Prisca and Aquila
On the one hand this couple was for all the churches; on the other hand they were for their local church in particular
In chapter one we see sinners people that are evil unclean and condemned in chapter sixteen we see the churches that are holy and glorious
As a result of a long process sinners have become glorious churches, churches that are holy and yet so practical
If we are not in the church and do not practice the church life, it will be difficult for us to have Satan crushed under our feet by God
Whenever we are separated from the church, we become a prey for Satan, for it is difficult for us to fight Satan individually
When he is crushed under our feet in the church life, we have the peace of God as a token of our victory over him
Only the pure gospel, the living Christ, and God's revealed mystery can establish us and keep us in unity for the church life
God's condemnation reveals man's need of salvation, but for the righteous God to save sinful man, redemption is needed
In Romans 6 God has become the God in identification, having accomplished a great work in order to make us one with Himself
God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in His Body, and the Body of Christ is expressed in the churches
With the establishing of the churches in Romans 16, the eternal God has attained the peak of His work and is satisfied
If we had written Romans, we would have added another chapter saying, 'Dear brothers, look at the poor situation
Although Christians like to dream of the future in heaven, Paul knew that the Lord desires to have the churches on earth
In Romans 16 we have the local churches, and when we have the local churches, it is sufficient for us to be excited, happy and satisfied
Paul said that God was of power to establish us according to his gospel, not according to the gospel of Mark or Luke
Some Christians use the terms Body life and Body ministry but by Body ministry they mean a few persons ministering instead of one pastor
There is no need to say that cultic doctrines divide; even the proper, sound, fundamental, scriptural, spiritual doctrines are divisive
Paul told the Jewish and the Gentile believers alike to come to Christ and take Christ as their life and concept
Christ is the root of Jesse, the source of supply for all the Jews, and He is the One who rises to rule over the nations
We must forget our Jewish or Gentile background, our religious or philosophical background, and keep Christ as our unique concept
Do not say, 'I commend to you sister So-and-So who belongs to the Body of Christ and who is traveling around the world'
Through the process in chapters three through fifteen, in chapter sixteen, we are the saints composing the local churches
Other seeking Christians have gone as far as chapter twelve and talk about the Body, although they lack the genuine experience of the Body
Praise the Lord that we are abiding in the last station, in the local churches, where we realize the genuine Body life
Any discussion or dissension contrary to the Apostle's teaching is divisive, and we must keep a watchful, discerning eye over it
According to verse 17, we must turn away from those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to this teaching
Otherwise, our church life may be damaged by the 'smooth and flattering speech' of the dissenters who are out to deceive the simple
Some may come to you with smooth, flattering, eloquent talk, seeking to divide the church and to cause you to fall
If Paul faced that kind of difficulty in his time, surely it will also occur in our time because of the subtlety of the enemy
While we are happy, excited, and praising the Lord for the church life, we must keep a watchful eye over those who cause divisions
Since Romans is a long book and covers many points, it is quite difficult for most readers to find the basic thought
Many Christians say that the basic thought of Romans is justification by faith, and others say that it is the salvation of God
The basic thought of this book is that God is making sons out of sinners to forma body for Christ that He may be expressed
Having this concept as the basic content of Romans, Paul covered so many details relating to it in sixteen chapters
When we get into this book, we see that it reveals that God is working to make sons out of sinners to form the Body to express Christ
In this message we shall temporarily set aside the middle section and consider only the first and last sections
The many sons are called not the many members of the Body of Christ, but the many brothers of the firstborn Son
Now God not only has the unique Son, the only begotten Son, but also the many sons, the brothers of the Firstborn
If God were to expose all we have done in the past, we would not be able to stand it, for what we did was dirty, ugly, evil, and dark
People can understand us when we tell them that their deeds are sinful, and they can be convinced that they have been constituted sinners
If we tell them that, as constituted sinners who do evil things, they are short of God's glory, they will say, 'What do you mean?
In Romans Paul tells us that God has put His righteousness upon us and that He has reckoned His righteousness to be ours
Temporary our holiness may seem to be, it is nevertheless a fact that we are under God's infusing, God's permeating
We have been justified with His righteousness, we are being sanctified with His holiness, and we shall be glorified with His glory
It is difficult to determine whether this is the Holy Spirit or our human spirit because it refers to the mingled spirit
In chapters seven and eight we have two kinds of experiences, the experience in the flesh and the experience in the spirit
If we had only chapter five without chapter seven, we would have the fact that we were so dead, but not the experience
The experience in the spirit in chapter eight is the experience of the fact of being in Christ revealed in chapter six
In Adam we inherited sin, were under the reign of death, and were constituted sinners under God's condemnation
We are resurrected, we are living, and we are growing together with Christ in the likeness of His resurrection
If we stand on these facts we may present ourselves to God as slaves and present our members as weapons of righteousness unto sanctification
After we realize that we have died with Christ, we must also see that we no longer have anything to do with the law
He will find himself in Romans 7, in the situation of not doing what he wills to do, but of doing what he does not will to do
As we pointed out, this was Paul's experience before he was saved, but nearly all Christians pass through it after they are saved
If we do not have such an experience, we shall not be exposed to the uttermost and shall not realize how hopeless we are
We need to walk, behave, and have our being according to the spirit and continually set our mind upon the spirit
We shall have freedom and the indwelling Christ will impart life into every part of our being even into the weak members of our mortal body
They have been redeemed, justified, reconciled, and saved, but they have stopped their journey at justification
After the end of World War II, some of the saints in the second station began to talk very much about the Body
According to the experience of many Christians today, it is not actually the station of the Body, but the station of Body-talk
Along with the third category of Christians, the Body-talkers, there is the fourth category: those who practice the church life
In order to accomplish the task of making sons out of sinners to form the Body of Christ, God firstly had to take care of our past deeds
Christ's death on the cross deals with what we have done, and the resurrected Christ living in us deals with what we are
Now Christ is living in us, working God's holiness into our being to accomplish for us a subjective sanctification
His death brought the righteousness of God to us, but His dwelling in us works God's holiness into our very being
We were born in the realm, sphere, and element of Adam, but we have been transferred into the realm, sphere, and element of Christ
No one at a gambling table complains of tiredness, for everyone is full of energy because the body is a body of sin
Even if a man's wife would plead for him to come home, he would stay at the gambling table for several more hours
The body is not the sinning person; it is the sinning instrument, the means by which a person does sinful things
The more man tried to keep the law, the more he broke it; and the more he broke the law, the more he was exposed
In chapter six, our old man is the sinning person, but in chapter seven our old man is the self-assuming husband
Praise the Lord that the old man as the sinning person and as the self-assuming husband has been crucified and buried!
The way to be freed from the flesh is found in Romans 8, where we see that we are freed from the flesh by walking according to the spirit
If we do not walk according to the spirit, we are still in the flesh, although we may be free from both sin and the law
The main point in chapter seven is that our old husband has been crucified and that we have been freed from the law
As we have seen, the focal point of the revelation in this book is that God is transforming sinners into sons to form the Body of Christ
God is expressed in the Son, the Son is expressed in the Body, and the Body is expressed in the local churches
One day, while the mother is outside, the little boy, wondering what is in the bottle, takes it, opens it, and drinks some of the poison
Most Christians think that man merely disobeyed God and made a mistake in taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge
Not many realize that by man's eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, something evil and even satanic entered into man
In 512 Paul says As through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin and so death passed to all men because all have sinned
After being stung by death, we become so weak that no matter how hard we try to honor our parents or love our wives, we simply cannot do it
If we try to be upright, holy, spiritual, and perfect, we shall find that instead of being perfect, we are constantly being killed by death
Immediately, however, you began to consider and deliberate, thinking that you should not utter anything carelessly
When there is the opportunity to do something sinful, the tiredness disappears because the body of sin is so powerful
In going to worldly amusements the body of sin is active, but in going to the church meeting the body of death is weak
When our spirit is cold, or even lukewarm, we may not desire to go to the meeting, but prefer to stay home and rest
What we need to do is actually very simple: Turn to the spirit, stay in the spirit, and act, behave, and walk according to the spirit
If we, the believers, are led of the Lord to fast and if we fast in the spirit, we may go for many days without any problem
Immediately you will sense that power and strength from the fountain in your spirit are being transmitted into your mortal body
In verse 10 we have the word 'in'; however, in verse 11 it is no longer just a matter of 'in,' but of indwelling
A few years ago a young man stood up in a conference and said that he did not agree with calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
In this message we need to consider several verses in chapters five through eight of Romans that cover the matter of death
Romans 6:23 says, 'For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord'
When you lost your temper in the past, you did not sense the killing because you had not made a law about losing your temper
Whenever we make up our mind to do good in order to please God, this element is stirred up and seems to say, 'What!
Although it is difficult to find terminology to express what this law is, it is easy to understand it according to experience
If you should try to do any of these things, you feel that you are hollow and empty and that your words are lifeless
All these items-darkness, uneasiness, dissatisfaction, weakness, and dryness-are signs of inward spiritual death
It conveys the thought, not of staying in a place for a certain time, but of making your home in a place, of settling down there
In Romans 8:10 Paul says, 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
Unlike the dried leaves that were being carried aimlessly downstream, the fish, full of life, were swimming upstream with a definite purpose
All the unsaved people are like the dried leaves: they are being carried aimlessly along by the current of the age
We, the believers in Christ, are like the fish swimming against the current of the age with a definite purpose
The reason today's society is such a confusion is that it is filled with dead people, with those who are dead in body, soul, and spirit
When we heard the gospel and called on the name of the Lord Jesus, immediately the Holy Spirit came into our spirit and enlivened it
Many have a mind of death because they do not allow the indwelling Christ in their spirit to spread into their mind
The death described in Romans 5 through 8 is not mainly the death that causes people to die physically, but the death that kills them today
If you cannot open your mouth to testify in a living way, it is because of the deadening, the working, of death
If you were not under death, you would be bubbling, praying, praising, functioning, and testifying all the time
The kind of death here is not that which causes people to die physically and to be buried; it is the death that deadens them all day long
Once while Brother Nee was speaking, he asked the sisters to tell him how many chapters there are in the Gospel of Matthew
Many Christians find it difficult to remember verses in the Bible, but they can easily remember so many details about their possessions
Death is working in an inward direction from our body to our spirit, but life works in an outward direction from our spirit to our body
You will see that Christ, who is your life, will have a free course within you to spread into every part of your being
In typology, if a person was contaminated by an unclean thing, he could be cleansed rather easily and in a short period of time
It is better to make a mistake in functioning in the meetings than to be dead and not make any mistakes at all
Seeing a man blind from birth, the Lord's disciples asked Him, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind'?
The Lord replied, 'Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him'
Verse 10 says, 'But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He also went up, not publicly, but as in secret'
We shall have our whole being according to the spirit, and we shall think, express ourselves, and do everything in the spirit
Corinthians 15:26 says that death is the last enemy, and Revelation 20:14, that death will be cast into the lake of fire
In Revelation 20 death is related to Satan on the one hand and to Hades on the other, both of which are to be cast into the lake of fire
In 7:23 Paul speaks of 'the law of my mind,' and in 8:2, of 'the law of sin and of death' and of the 'law of the Spirit of life'
It is difficult to understand the words 'law' and 'life' and even more difficult to understand the term 'the law of the Spirit of life'
In chapter seven, however, there is still another law: 'I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me'
Some with this problem have even thought to stop being Christians and have said to themselves, 'I don't want to be a Christian any longer
Christians have often prayed that the Lord would help them to do good, to do such things as love their wives or submit to their husbands
Regarding this, we need a revelation, a vision, that will keep us from pushing the button that causes evil to be present with us
Now we need to consider the law of good in our mind, the law of sin in our members, and the law of life in our spirit
We are a miniature garden of Eden because the triangular situation involving God, man, and Satan is now within us
The divine person has the divine life, the human person has the human life, and the evil person has the evil life
Everyone, no matter whether he is a gentleman or a robber, has the human life, which is good, and the satanic life, which is evil
It is no longer we who do certain things; rather, it is an evil person with an evil life within us who does those things
In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus told the Jews, 'You are of your father the devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father'
In our soul we have the human person, in our body we have the satanic person, and in our spirit we have the divine person
Turning from animal life to plant life, we may take fruit trees as another illustration of the fact that every life has a law
An orange tree has the life of an orange tree, in which there is the law that functions in the bearing of oranges
Although we may be political in this way, eventually the law of the satanic life will cause us to lose our temper
The human life is weak, and its law is fragile because of the presence of the law of the satanic life, which is much stronger
As long as you walk according to the spirit and live by the law of the divine life, this law will work for you spontaneously
If you keep your finger on the button you will be in the spirit the Spirit will be life to you and every negative thing will be put to death
The secret to keeping our finger on the right button is to know that we have a human spirit and that the Spirit of life is in our spirit
As we do this, the desire for good by the human life with its law of good is satisfied, and the requirements of the law of God are fulfilled
In Genesis 2 life is represented by the tree of life, and death, by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Although it brings forth death, it is not called the tree of death; instead, it is called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The concept of good and evil in the Bible, however, is different; the Bible puts both good and evil in the same category
Belonging to one family, they are three 'sisters' who work together to bring forth death, which is, of course, the opposite of life
Some Christians say that we should no longer be concerned about the tree of life and the tree of knowledge spoken of in Genesis 2
Most of the items found in Genesis are seeds of spiritual truths developed elsewhere in the Bible, and we should not neglect them
Life abounds in the New Jerusalem, for there we see the river of water of life with the tree of life growing in it
Because the seeds of life and of death grow throughout the Bible, we can trace in the Bible both the line of life and the line of death
Today we are all heading toward this ultimate consummation, the believers to the New Jerusalem and the unbelievers to the lake of fire
In their everyday experience many Christians have one foot on the line of life and the other on the line of death
Perhaps yesterday you were on the line of death, but today, by the Lord's mercy and grace, you are once again on the line of life
Romans 5:12 says, 'Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned'
The next verse says For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection
Verse 10 continues, 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
If the life-giving Spirit dwells in us, that is, makes His home in us, He will even impart the divine life into our mortal bodies
All married brothers and sisters know that the husbands should love their wives and that the wives should submit to their husbands
In these chapters he lays great emphasis on life and death and seems not to care about love or hate, submission or rebellion
In His economy God does not mainly care whether we are good or evil, submissive or rebellious; He cares only whether we are living or dead
Romans 8:6 does not say that the mind set upon the spirit is submission and that the mind set upon the flesh is rebellion
In order for us to apply electricity, it must be first installed in our home, and then we need to use a switch
To set our mind on the flesh does not mean merely to set it on our body; it means to set it on our being, our self
Suppose, after he had been called by God, Abraham had asked the Lord to tell him where he should go the next day
If you try this reckoning without being in the spirit, you will find that the more you reckon, the more you are in death
When we are insulated and thereby cut off from the spirit, we are in death and cannot handle even the smallest problem
We see that the result of minding the flesh is death and that the result of minding the spirit is life and peace
In the very beginning of the Bible life is signified by the tree of life, and death, by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The Bible concludes with two consummations: the lake of fire, which is the second death, and the New Jerusalem, which is the city of life
As we pointed out in the last message, sometimes we may have one foot on the line of life and the other on the line of death
Concerning the abiding in Christ, we first need to seek the answer to this question: Where is the Christ in whom we must abide?
We can understand the meaning of the words 'Follow Me,' but it is not easy to understand the words 'Abide in Me'
Even if we know where Christ is and what the 'Me' is in whom we must abide, we still need to know how to remain in Him
In order to answer all these questions we have raised regarding abiding in Christ, we need to come again to Romans 8
In order to understand your fathers thought as revealed in the letter you would need to read the whole letter not just the first few pages
In the Bible, the Triune God is not for us to analyze in a doctrinal way, but for the dispensing of Himself into us
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The Lord answered Philip in a mysterious way, telling him that as long as he had seen the Lord Himself, he had seen the Father
If we consider carefully verses 17 and 18, we see that the Spirit of reality is actually the Lord Jesus Himself
The last Adam, Jesus in the flesh, was transfigured through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
Because the Spirit is the realization of the Son, we get the Spirit whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we get the Spirit because the Spirit is the reality of the name of Jesus
The totality of the wonderful Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is in our spirit for us to experience
Romans 8:6 points the way: 'For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace'
In the body originally created by God there was no sinful element; on the contrary, the human body was pure and sinless
Our spirit is mingled with the Triune God, and our body, which has become the flesh, is mixed with the sinful element of Satan
Now, as those who were represented by Adam in Genesis 2, we have the tree of life in our spirit and the tree of knowledge in our flesh
Do you think you can defeat Satan by sound teachings, by correct methods, or by the knowledge of the Scripture in letters?
Day by day and even moment by moment, we need to set our mind, which represents our whole being, on the mingled spirit
We have learned from Romans 8 that all we need to do is turn our being to the living One who indwells our spirit and stay one with Him
They will not see the temporary results of our own efforts, but they will see Christ as the life-giving Spirit being lived out of us
In verses 17 and 20 Paul says that sin dwells in him, and in verse 18 he says that in him, that is, in his flesh, nothing good dwells
In a sense, the sin that dwells in our flesh, the fallen body poisoned by the nature of the evil one, is Satan incarnated
Through experience, Paul discovered that there was something evil, the evil nature of Satan, living and dwelling in his flesh
In contrast to Romans 7 which exposes sin dwelling in our flesh, Romans 8 reveals that something wonderful dwells in our spirit
Verses 10 and 11 say, 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness
If Christ is in us, the spirit is life because of righteousness, even though the fallen body remains dead because of sin
If the Christ who is in us is also making His home in us, the indwelling Spirit will give life to our mortal body
Whether or not our mortal body is enlivened depends on whether or not we allow the Spirit to make His home in us
As a result, the inner circle of our being, our spirit, is life, but the outer circle, our body, is still dead
In order for our mortal body to be enlivened, the indwelling Christ must have free course to spread Himself throughout our being
In attempting to fulfill the requirements of the law, the mind was doing something good, but it was acting independently
Romans 8:6 gives us another view of the mind: 'For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace'
We have seen clearly that Satan as sin dwells in our flesh and that Christ as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit
In order to deal with this, we need to call on the very Lord Jesus who dwells in our spirit and keep our mind set on the spirit
Christians have devoted a great deal of attention to the death of Christ, but not much attention to Christ's life
Life there refers neither to the physical life nor to the soulish or psychological life but to the divine life, the life of God
According to the revelation of John's Gospel, life is a living person, Christ, who is the very embodiment of God
As we pointed out in the foregoing message, the way to abide in Christ is found not in John 15 but in Romans 8
In the same principle, many other wonderful aspects of life found in the Gospel of John are developed in the book of Romans
In John we have a vision of life; however, this Gospel does not give us the definite way to experience this life
Paul says that 'we shall be saved in His life,' indicating that we still need to experience the saving life of Christ
We need no help in losing our temper, for we lose it spontaneously according to the working of the law of sin within us
There is no need for us to try to be proud or jealous, because the law of sin produces pride and jealousy in us
Lying, like all other sinful things, is not something we are taught to do; it comes from the law of sin within us
The Gospel of John speaks of the Spirit and also of life, but it says nothing of the law of the Spirit of life
Because the Gospel of John does not speak of the function of life, this book does not give us the way to apply life
By setting our being on the spirit, we spontaneously apply the divine life within us to our situation, and we are set free
When we are freed from the law of sin in this way, we have the sense that we are in the heavens and that sin is under our feet
Sometimes even little children are so stubborn that they refuse the help of the mother and try to solve their problems alone
The way to be saved from the law of sin is to set our being on the spirit and to enjoy the spontaneous working of the divine life
Philosophers have exhausted themselves in their efforts to deal with sin, but they have not been able to find the way
Our spirit today is mingled with and indwelt by the divine Spirit, and we can set our mind upon this mingled spirit
The sanctification revealed in these chapters of Romans is not outward positional sanctification but inward dispositional sanctification
Not only our outward conduct and behavior must be separated from the world, but even our disposition, our very being, must be separated also
If you consider only the style, you may be sanctified in buying shoes, but this is not the inward sanctification by life
The main point is not buying the proper shoes; it is that even in the process of buying a pair of shoes you are sanctified inwardly by life
In the foregoing message we saw that after being saved, justified, and reconciled to God, we still need to be saved in Christ's life
If they were suddenly transported to heaven, upon arriving there they might feel that they are not suitable for the glory of heaven
The telling of lies and the losing of temper are an automatic product of the spontaneous working of the law of sin
As long as we are in Christ as life, we are spontaneously freed by the law of His life from the law of sin and of death
A new element, a divine, holy, heavenly element, must be added to our natural element to produce a metabolic, organic change
In transforming us, He is not primarily concerned with our outward appearance, but with what we are organically
To continue the illustration of makeup, the best way to improve our facial color is not to put on makeup but to eat nourishing food
Some who have realized this have become so disappointed that they have thought it hopeless to have the church life in a practical way
The source of our trouble is our mind, which has been saturated and permeated with all kinds of natural concepts
We need to drop not only non-Christian concepts, but also Christian concepts, the concepts we took in when we were in the denominations
Now that the Lord, in His mercy, has brought us together for the church life, we need the renewing of the mind
Christ died on the cross for our redemption; through redemption we have been justified by God and reconciled to Him
Because reconciliation through the death of Christ is an accomplished fact, in 5:10 Paul used the past tense with respect to reconciliation
Because we are still in the process of being saved in life, Paul used the future tense when speaking about being saved in the life of Christ
There is no need to teach a child to love the world, for there is something in his nature that causes him to love it
God has nothing to do with our natural being, our natural life, our natural strength, our natural disposition, or our natural power
Because we are individualistic, a wife does not like to be dependent on her husband, and a husband does not like to be dependent on his wife
As a complete sketch of the Christian life and the church life, the book of Romans firstly reveals the matter of justification
God's goal is the building up of the church as the Body for Christ's expression and as the house for God's dwelling
For this reason, the book of Romans begins with justification, goes on to life, and concludes with the building
As those who have been saved, redeemed, justified, and reconciled, we are not idly waiting for the Lord to come back
Beginning with justification, we must go on to the experience of life in order to reach the goal of the building
Justification is in chapters one through four; sanctification, in chapters five through eight; and transformation, in chapter twelve
Due to these problems, the church has not yet been built up, although it has been in existence for more than nineteen hundred years
Our burden is not to do a great deal of work; it is to see the genuine building up of the saints for the Lord's coming back
In order to be built up with our husband or wife, or with others in the church, our mind, emotion, and will must be dealt with
In some areas of the church service, there is no harmony because certain saints differ in their concept or in their feeling
Many have consecrated themselves to Christ and the church, but they still have a problem with their mind, emotion, and will
The outward environment of the church life is a test of our inward being; it exposes what we are in our mind, emotion, and will
Before we got married, we regarded ourselves as rather holy, as Christians who loved the Lord and who were always seeking Him
By being offended by others in the church life, we find out that we have inward problems with our mind, emotion, and will
In order to be saved in life from the negative subjective elements within us, we need much of the Lord's grace
If we are willing to give ourselves to the Lord in this way, it will be possible for us to be built up with others
We need to be careful whenever our mind is strong, whenever our emotion is stirred up, and whenever our will is set
As long as we allow the 'I' to prevail, the Lord Jesus is dethroned within us and has no opportunity to live in us
If we dethrone the Lord Jesus in this way, the matter of being saved in His life will merely be a doctrine to us
When there are difficulties the husband tends to blame the wife the wife tends to blame the husband and both secretly tend to blame the Lord
Once we have been exposed, we shall surrender our inner being to the Lord, and He will be free to live within us
May the Lord have mercy upon us that we may see our need to be saved in His life from individualism for the building up of the Body
To be transformed is to be saved from naturalness, and to be built up into the Body is to be saved from individualism
If you had lived at the time of the Apostle Paul, would you have been able to receive all these types of Christians?
As long as someone believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, we need to receive him, no matter what he eats or whether he observes certain days
To eat something is to take it into us so that it becomes part of us, and to observe a day is to follow an outward ritual or regulation
According to Colossians 2:16 and 17, the regulations in the Bible regarding outward observances are types and shadows of Christ
The matters of eating and drinking and of keeping certain days are shadows, but the body, the reality of these shadows, is Christ
All the items suitable for God's people to eat, as recorded in Leviticus 11, are types of different aspects of Christ
Because Christ is the completion, the perfection, of everything God has done, Christ is our satisfaction and rest
We should hold on to everything that is of Christ, but we should cast aside those things that are not of Christ
In Romans 14:1 and 2 he said, 'Now him who is weak in faith receive, not with a view to passing judgment on reasonings
On the one hand, we need to realize that so many physical things and special days are types and shadows of Christ
We have seen that all Christians have the same saving faith, believing in the Person and work of the Lord Jesus
As we have pointed out, it is difficult for Christians to agree in their understanding of many things in the Bible
Christians also have different opinions about praising the Lord, calling on the name of Jesus, and pray-reading the Word
Such insisting does far more than expose our lack of wisdom it exposes the very element of divisiveness rooted deep within our natural being
Because of this element, we have the tendency to divide ourselves from others and to form our own kind of group
In 1957 the leading brothers in the church in Taipei were burdened to visit the leaders of the independent Christian groups in that city
Some of these groups, claiming to be nondenominational, said that they were meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus
Many say that it is impossible to have the oneness today and that it is idealistic to try to have the church life in genuine oneness
If the Lord had not been merciful to us in China, we brothers could not have been brought into oneness and kept in oneness
If we require the believers to either drop or adopt certain practices in order to be accepted by us, we are divisive
No matter what kind of background a believer may have, as long as he is a Christian, we must receive him as a brother in the Lord
Because we are still in the old nature with its divisive element, we dare not say that we have been fully delivered from divisiveness
We also need to pray that the Lord will grant us the genuine growth in life so that we may be saved from divisiveness
Since Christ's death has already dealt with the negative things, why do we still need to be saved in His life?
All that Christ has accomplished on the cross is an objective fact, but we need a subjective experience of this fact, an experience in life
Christ died on the cross as our substitute, but furthermore there is the need for us to be identified with Him in His death
The only way Christ's accomplishment in substitution can be applied to us in experience is by our having Christ as our life
In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus spoke about denying the self immediately after He had said to Peter, 'Get behind Me, Satan'!
In the eyes of God, someone who is naturally loving has the same essence as one who is naturally full of hatred
When Christ died on the cross, He pronounced the sentence of judgment on the self, but this judgment still needs to be executed
Until then, we are simply children, those who can cry 'Abba Father' and who have the witness of the Spirit with their spirit
The designation of the one Son is related to the prototype; the conformation of the many sons is the work of 'mass production'
Having gained the prototype, God is now seeking to have the 'mass production' in order to produce many sons in the image of the Firstborn
In chapters three, four, and five he does speak of propitiation, redemption, justification, and reconciliation
The reason Paul does not mention propitiation, redemption, or reconciliation in 8:30 is that they are all included in justification
For this reason, there are not separate sections in this book for propitiation, redemption, nor reconciliation
In the same principle, in 8:30 Paul does not mention sanctification or transformation because both are included in glorification
The glorification of the believers, they claim, will take place instantaneously at the coming of the Lord Jesus
2 Corinthians 3:18 speaks of being transformed from glory to glory, that is, from one degree of glory to another
After the water has been permeated with the essence of tea, it will no longer be called water; it will be called tea
God has put Christ, the heavenly 'tea,' into us, and the organic element of this 'tea' is causing a metabolic change in our natural life
Once the Lord has 'tea-ified' us, we cannot be the same, even if we decide to leave the church life and go back to the world
You may return to the world but you will not be able to eradicate the work of sanctification and transformation the Lord has done within you
Do not separate sanctification, transformation, and conformation; all three are interrelated and are for the goal of glorification
The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast to the flesh in verse 3, which speaks of Christ as the seed of David according to the flesh
In the flesh Christ was designated or marked out through resurrection according to this holy and divine essence
Before His death and resurrection the holiness of God was in Christ's spirit, but this holy essence had not been manifested in His flesh
The Lord Jesus was processed through death and resurrection, and now we are being processed through the working together of all things
The divine concept is not to correct us outwardly; it is to transform us inwardly and organically with Christ Himself as the holy essence
In the same principle, we are all undergoing the process of God's sanctification, whether we are conscious of it or not
Such a desperate prayer may help your spiritual digestion, but it does not actually affect the process of saturation
As we pointed out in the foregoing message, in 1:4 we have the formation of the prototype, but in 8:29, the work of 'mass production'
Through the process of death and resurrection, this holy essence saturated and permeated the Lord's humanity, including His flesh
As believers in the Lord Jesus, we also have the divine essence of holiness, which is the Spirit of holiness, the very Christ, in our spirit
Today, after many years of being processed, this brother is not only a kind man, but a permeated and saturated man
Because both He, the firstborn Son, and we, the many sons, are the same in the divine life and nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers
Christ does not sanctify us by adjusting us outwardly nor by making us conform to certain external regulations
Christ today is the Spirit of holiness, the very divine essence of holiness working organically within our being
Although we may not be conscious of Christ's working within us, He is nonetheless working to saturate our being with the sanctifying essence
Once this holy essence has saturated you, it is impossible to eradicate it, for it has permeated your being organically and metabolically
By being in the church life for a period of time, you have been in a 'clinic' where you have received an 'injection'
According to verse 21, grace reigns unto eternal life, which means that the reign of grace results in eternal life
John 14 says In Him was life and verse 14 of the same chapter says The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and reality
In verse 36 the Lord speaks about being set free: 'If then the Son shall set you free, you shall be really free'
Those under the bondage of sin and in death can be set free by the living Son of God, the One who is the living reality
In the Gospel of John we have life, grace, abundance of life, sin, death, slavery, and being set free from sin and death
Our Christian life today should be not only a victorious and overcoming life; it should also be a kingly life, a reigning life
If sin, death, and Satan are defeated, your temper will also be defeated and even become something of comeliness
In the same principle, the reason the self is so ugly is that sin, death, and Satan make their abode within us
Husbands, the Lord has appointed you to be the head with respect to your wife, but not to be a king ruling over her
If we would know what it means for grace to reign unto eternal life, we must have a proper understanding of grace
If we have a thorough understanding of the Bible, we shall realize that God has no intention to give us anything other than Himself
Our unique portion is God Himself, and grace is God as our portion for our participation, experience, and enjoyment
If we consider John 1:1 and 1:14 in context, we shall see that grace is God coming to us to be dispensed into us for our enjoyment
Sin is the embodiment of the evil nature of Satan in our flesh, and grace is God in Christ embodied in our spirit
The principle of reigning in life is revealed in chapter five, but the experience of reigning in life is in chapter eight
The only thing that works is to come to the divine source and open ourselves from the depths of our being to be filled with God as grace
As you receive grace in this way, you will be filled with grace and eventually grace will overflow from within you
If we come to the heavenly source and open ourselves thoroughly to be filled with grace, we shall reign over them in life
God's intention in His creation of man was that man would express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion or authority
According to Genesis 1, man is to reign over the earth and especially over the creeping things, over the serpent in particular
To understand the difference between sin and evil, we need to see that before the creation of man God had a unique enemy, Satan, the Devil
Although other divine attributes exist apart from God's coming into man, there is no grace apart from God's being incarnated in man
Whenever we make up our mind to do good by keeping the law in order to please God, sin is aroused and becomes evil
Romans 86 also proves that we can be in death today For the mind set on the flesh is death but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace
In a sense, God's enemy, Satan, is prevailing today as sin and as evil to bring people into death and to keep them there
The only way for our soul and our body to be sanctified is for us to be fully saturated with this inner, reigning life
Eventually, our vile body will be transfigured, that is, it will be fully saturated and permeated with the glory of God's reigning life
The tabernacle in the Old Testament is a picture of the genuine oneness for which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17
If Christians are to be truly one, they should not only come together, but also be built up together in the divine life
To be one, we need not only to love one another, but also to be overlaid with gold and held together by golden bars
No matter how we may feel at times about a 'board' with which we are connected, we should not separate ourselves from him
Before we do this, however, let us review the difference between sin and evil and that between grace and the Spirit
Death has a number of aspects, the present aspect and the future aspect, the subjective aspect and the objective aspect
After the millennium, all the unbelieving dead will be raised and will stand before the white throne to be judged
Those whose names are not found in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death
Our burden in this message is not with this future, objective aspect of death; it is with the present, subjective aspect
In 6:21 and 23 Paul says that the end of the things of which we now are ashamed is death and that death is the wages of sin
The death that Paul is speaking about in chapter seven is not the death coming in the future; it is the death working within us right now
A dove, representing the Spirit, was pictured as coming into people when they believed in the Lord and flying away when they sinned
Ephesians 4:30 says, 'Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption'
When some hear that we can have the Spirit without experiencing life, they may argue that it is impossible to have the Spirit without life
For this reason, it would be very difficult for a sister to stay away from the department stores for three months
If the sisters do no unnecessary shopping, they will see what a great difference it makes in their experience of life
If the sisters can overcome the matters of gossiping and shopping, they will be overflowing with life in the church meetings
Gossiping may not be sinful, but because it is a matter that brings in death, it is abominable in the eyes of God
Because so many Christians are deadened within, it is impossible for them to have continual experiences of life
As Hebrews 416 says we should come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help
Death cannot hold the divine life signified by the Lord's bones, which were not broken when He was on the cross
A saved person is rather complicated because Satan as sin is in his flesh and the Lord as the life-giving Spirit is in his spirit
If we would overcome Satan and reign in life over him, we need to recognize that Satan as sin dwells in our flesh
The Spiritual Man, completed in 1928, presented spiritual warfare as an individual matter, not as a Body matter
For this reason, after he had come to see the Body, Brother Nee told some of us that he did not want to have it reprinted
We have not only seen the Body, but we have also seen the place of the divine life in dealing with God's enemy
Romans 16 does not refer to the Body in a universal sense, but it refers to the local and practical expression of the Body
It is only when we have a proper local church as the practical expression of the Body that Satan is crushed under our feet
If we understand 1 John 5:4 in the light of John 3:6, we shall realize that what is born of God is the human spirit
John 518 says We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not but he that is begotten of God keepeth him and the evil one toucheth him not
Romans 8:4 says that if we walk according to spirit, not according to flesh, the righteous requirement of the law will be fulfilled in us
Penn-Lewis regarding the warfare with Satan were not wrong, but they placed too much emphasis on the negative aspect
Penn-Lewis said that the way to overcome Satan is by seeing that we have been crucified with Christ on the cross
If we stay in our spirit, we have the reality of being crucified with Christ, and we have Christ as our reigning life
When we find ourselves thinking critically of others, we need to turn immediately to the Lord in our spirit and pray
In the spirit with the divine life and with the Body of Christ, Satan is overcome and even crushed under our feet
In the foregoing messages we have seen that we need to reign in life over sin, death, and Satan, our three main enemies
My burden in this message is to point out that the three main enemies-sin, death, and Satan-are centered in man's flesh
We should not condemn sin, death, and Satan without realizing that the very center of our problem is the flesh
We simply cannot get away from the flesh; we are unable to walk away from it in the way we can walk out of a building
If the Lord were to take away our flesh and leave us empty, we would not be able to keep ourselves pure very long
Our concern in this message is not with the flesh as revealed in 3:20, but with the flesh as covered in chapters seven and eight
Because of false humility, we may not say that we are better than others, but inwardly this is the way we often feel
It is necessary for Christians to seek the Lord, to aspire to be spiritual, and to overcome all negative things
If we love the Lord and seek Him, even losing our temper will work on our behalf, for it will force us to go to the Lord
After we lose our temper, we may feel ashamed for several hours, unwilling to pray because we are too ashamed to pray
Eventually, however, our intense desire for the Lord will compel us to pray, and we shall pray in a very good way
God deliberately permitted certain enemies to remain for the purpose of strengthening the children of Israel and of training them to fight
Although we may try diligently to reign in life over these three enemies, we shall experience more failure than success
Without the help rendered by the sinful, ugly flesh, we would not be as desperate to gain the Lord or to have Him wrought into us
As long as God has the opportunity to work Himself into our being, He does not care very much whether our situation is excellent or poor
Doctrinally speaking, it is easy to say that we should turn to our spirit, but it is rather difficult to practice this
In such a case it may be difficult to turn to the spirit outwardly, before man, but it is easier to have a genuine, inward turn
For the sake of His economy, God uses our sinful, ugly flesh to force us to turn to our spirit that we may gain more of the Spirit
In the very first verse of Romans Paul says that as a slave of Christ and a called apostle, he was 'separated to the gospel of God'
It is our attitude toward the gospel that determines whether we are obedient or disobedient and whether or not we are enemies
The gospel that Paul proclaimed in Romans was to be preached not only to unbelievers, but also to the believers in the Lord
The first of these elements is found in Genesis 1:26, where we are told that man was created in the image of God
Many kinds of life-vegetable, animal, and even the human life-are related to this land, which typifies the all-inclusive Christ
The matter of God's producing a bride for Christ is also an element of the gospel promised in the Old Testament
Verse 4 says that He was 'designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead'
According to such a Spirit, Christ was designated, marked out, the Son of God in power out of the resurrection of the dead
The gospel is concerned with a wonderful Person who became flesh and was designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness
The central message of the book of Romans is that sinful, fleshly people are made sons of God and conformed to the image of the Son of God
In Romans Paul does not say that the power of the gospel is the Holy Spirit or the love of God or the grace of God
The giving of the Holy Spirit is at least somewhat related to our obedience and therefore is not unconditional
When we act according to righteousness, we do certain things, not out of love, but because we are bound by righteousness to do them
After listening to the gospel concerning the love of God, some have said to us, 'Yes, God is love, but I'm not lovable
Before we were enlightened regarding the righteousness of God, we had difficulty answering questions such as these
Because God is righteous, He is bound to forgive us if we come to Him through Christ, no matter how He may feel about it
To do this, we firstly need to know what the gospel is, and then we need to experience all that the gospel includes
We also need to learn how to minister the gospel to others, that is, how to function as priests in ministering the gospel of God
Whenever we contact anyone, whether a believer or an unbeliever, we need to know his need as far as the gospel is concerned
For this, we all must learn the elements and the details of the gospel, and we need to experience the full content of the gospel
Along with this, we must develop the proper technique and skill to minister Christ in the gospel according to what we have experienced
The Body of Christ cannot be built up with people in the flesh; it can be built only with the glorious sons of God
In order for the Body to be produced, people in the flesh must become conformed to the image of the Son of God
The central thought of Romans is not condemnation nor justification; it is not even sanctification nor glorification
He does not want simply an individual expression in the only begotten Son, but a Body expression, a corporate expression, in many sons
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Many of us were taught that we were sinners, that God loved us, and that God sent His Son to die on the cross for our redemption
As the model, Christ has two natures: the nature according to the flesh and the nature according to the Spirit of holiness
Many of the things He said and did were extraordinary, things which no ordinary human being could possibly say or do
Those responsible for the crucifixion of Christ did not realize that crucifixion was the best way for Him to be designated, to be glorified
As such a marvelous Person, He has become the model, the pattern, of all those who are being designated sons of God
Through incarnation Christ put humanity upon Himself and thereafter had two natures, the divine nature and the human nature
In the same principle, we are designated the sons of God by a change in life through the process of resurrection
Now we, like the carnation seed that is sown into the earth, must pass through the process of death and resurrection
Praise the Lord that we are daily being put to death so that we may share Christ's resurrection in a practical way
Not only have we been grafted into Christ that we may have a vital union with Him in His death, but we also enjoy His resurrection
In this process of resurrection there are four aspects: sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification
As those who are in the process of resurrection we have as the last step of resurrection the transfiguration the glorification of our bodies
These ones teach that sanctification has nothing to do with sin, but that it is related to the change of position
We have pointed out that the ultimate step of the process of resurrection is glorification, the transfiguration of our body
The divine life within us will eventually be expressed through our physical body in a full way, transfiguring it into a glorious body
The gospel does not simply involve matters such as redemption, forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, cleansing, and regeneration
In the very first verse Paul says, 'Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God'
The fact that Romans opens with a word about the gospel of God indicates that the gospel is the subject of this book
The gospel of God concerns the Son of God who became flesh, who became the seed of a man according to the flesh
Through this designation the Christ who was already the Son of God before His incarnation became the Son of God in a new way
Since Christ was already the Son of God, how could there have been the need for Him to be begotten as the Son of God?
Acts 13:33, which quotes from Psalm 2:7, indicates that Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of His resurrection
A carnation seed is designated, not by being labeled, but by being buried into the ground and by growing into a blossoming carnation plant
As the Son of God with both divinity and humanity, Christ is now the pattern and model for the mass production of the many sons of God
Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and in His crucifixion He brought this flesh to the cross and terminated it
Having been grafted into Christ and into the likeness of His death, we are now undergoing the process of resurrection
Now we are experiencing the resurrection of what has already been resurrected and the release of what has already been released
The death of Christ will then open the way for His resurrection power to release something of Christ from within this brother
In the illustration of making tea, the disposition of the water, even its essence, is changed as the water is 'tea-ified'
The transfiguration, the redemption, of our body at the Lord's coming back will be the last step of the sonship
Only after we have been conformed to the image of Christ can we have the reality of the Body, of which we all are members
Romans 1:3 and 4 are a summary of the gospel, and the remainder of the book of Romans is the complete content of the gospel
In this gospel God is transforming sinners in the flesh into sons of God in power, by resurrection, and according to the Spirit of holiness
On the day of our glorification, no one will need to ask us whether or not we are Christians, for we shall be manifested as sons of God
Eventually, as the spontaneous continuation and consummation of these processes, we shall reach the stage of glorification or manifestation
When sanctification, transformation, and conformation reach their peak, that will be the time of our glorification
We shall not look at it objectively, from the standpoint of doctrine, but subjectively, from the standpoint of the experience of life
Some students of the Word have said that the resurrection mentioned here is the first resurrection spoken of in Revelation 20:4 and 5
What a difference there is between the doctrinal teaching regarding resurrection and the subjective revelation of Christ as resurrection!
What we need today is not the objective teaching about resurrection but the subjective living uptodate experience of Christ as resurrection
The first function of resurrection, of the life-power, is that of conquering the negative things, especially death
The more resurrection is placed in a situation of death, the more opportunity it has to function to conquer death
Through the function of the life-power, death is not only conquered, but is swallowed up to the point that it disappears
Resurrection, like the calamus used in making the anointing oil in Exodus 30, rises above the 'muddy' situations
Even if we do not have the realization that this life-power is within us, we do have the reality of this power
If we had Romans 6 without Romans 8, we would not be able to participate in Christ as resurrection in a practical way
We do not need to have our being according to the flesh, for we have the option of being according to the Spirit
If, like Paul, we would serve God in the gospel concerning His Son, we must know what sonship is and how it is realized
We need to help them to see the matter of designation by resurrection including sanctification transformation conformation and glorification
Many Christians devote their attention to objective teachings regarding the so-called dispensations in the Scriptures
According to the Bible, however, the word dispensation does not denote an age, but it denotes an act of dispensing
Being brought into the Lord's presence involves a process of sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification
We need to walk according to the Spirit, set our mind upon the Spirit, and by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body
The more we contact the Lord by calling upon His name, the more we sense His presence and the more we are conscious of His anointing within
By calling on the name of the Lord, we are watered, we are refreshed, we are sanctified, we are satisfied, and we are strengthened
Also God sanctifies us transforms us conforms us glorifies us and brings us into the full manifestation of sonship by the Spirit with life
The Spirit of holiness is the Spirit of the divine substance, whereas the Holy Spirit is the Person of the Spirit
Holiness does not mean sinless perfection or positional separation; it denotes the divine essence, the very substance of God's being
The fact that God is triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit- is related to His economy, to His dispensing of Himself into us
God the Father is embodied in God the Son, and God the Son is realized, transmitted, experienced and gained by us in God the Spirit
All the objective items of who Christ is and of what Christ is are recognized and taught by fundamental Christians today
According to 2 Corinthians 3:17, the Lord is this very Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty
What a frustration it would be to us if electricity had been installed into this building, but there were no switch
Time and time again we need to remind ourselves that Christ as the realization of the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
If we only meditate on the Lord, we shall not enjoy the practical, instant application of Him as the life-giving Spirit
A believer may enjoy a continual application of Christ, although he may not know much about Him in a doctrinal way
Many Christians concentrate on obtaining a doctrinal knowledge of Christ, but they neglect the practical experience of Him
If we would apply Him, we need to see that today, as the life-giving Spirit, He is the divine electricity in our spirit
By calling on the name of the Lord Jesus we are released from the vanity of the natural mind, and we are kept in the spirit
Designation is by resurrection, which includes sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification
The more we touch the Spirit, the more we enjoy resurrection and the more we are sanctified, transformed, and glorified
According to the book of Romans, the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God is related to at least ten items
The more we contact the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we become living, energized, strengthened, and satisfied
Because the law of the Spirit of life is higher than the law of sin and of death, it sets us free from that law
Of striving, we should simply contact the Spirit and give place to the spontaneous working of the law of the Spirit of life within us
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
When these items are added together, they equal sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification
What we need today is not the objective teachings, but the practical contact with the Lord by turning on the switch
As we call upon the name of the Lord, we touch the Spirit, who is the realization and application of the Triune God
The Father as the source is in the Son, who is the course, and the Son as the embodiment of the Father is now in the flow of the Spirit
All that God is in Christ and all that God has accomplished, obtained, and attained in Christ are in this current, this flow, this anointing
If we did not have a switch or did not know where the switch was, we would have no way of applying electricity
How different they are from Paul, who could attend a church meeting in his spirit even when he was not physically present
All that God is and all that He has accomplished are in the all-inclusive Spirit who has been installed in our spirit
My eyes were opened to see that the Christian life is not a matter of knowledge, but absolutely a matter of life and the Spirit
All that Christ is, all that He has accomplished, and all that He has obtained and attained are in the all-inclusive Spirit
In the last message we considered ten matters related to the Spirit holiness life law peace joy love hope power service and preaching
The Spirit bears witness that, as the children of God, we should not wear certain kinds of clothing or go to certain worldly places
Often the Spirit intercedes with sighs or groanings, especially when we are about to do something displeasing to the Lord
Because of the Spirit's groaning, the Christian life is not always a life of joy, for we are inwardly troubled when we do certain things
Verse 28 says that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose
The time to declare that all things work together for good is not when we are enjoying material benefits but when our situation is difficult
Translators have a difficult time deciding whether or not to use a capital letter for the word for Spirit in chapter eight
My advice to him would be that if he can participate in that athletic activity according to the spirit, then he should go ahead and do so
As Christians, we should not decide matters according to right or wrong; rather, we should decide them according to the spirit
The Spirit who is mingled with our spirit and according to whom we may have our very being is the wonderful Spirit of the Triune God
What counts is not teaching, but our living according to the mingled spirit and our helping others to do the same thing
In the mingled spirit we enjoy the riches of Christ, and here we have the church as the genuine expression of the Body of Christ
Romans 8:4 and 5 give us the key to the experience of Christ and the church life: walking according to the mingled spirit
The ointment has been compounded by the divine perfumer, and we now have the anointing of the ointment within us, in our spirit
Before His designation, according to the flesh He was just the seed of David; in that part of His being He was not yet the Son of God
As a righteous God and a just God, He cannot forgive sinful people without meeting the demands of His righteousness
By incarnation, the Lord took upon Himself the likeness of the flesh of sin and became identified with sinners in the flesh
Only with those things which are related to righteousness do we have the position to claim something in a legal way
During the last three hours, God laid all our sins upon Him, and then He judged Him, punished Him, and put Him to death
Before Christ died on the cross, it was still possible for God to change His mind about forgiving us of our sins
Now that Christ has died and has been raised from among the dead, it is impossible for God to change His mind about forgiving us
Now that Christ has died to fulfill God's righteous requirements, God has put Himself into a position where He is legally bound
The foundation of our salvation cannot be shaken, for this foundation is not love nor grace, but righteousness
The Bible does not say that love is the power of the gospel; neither does it say that grace is the power of the gospel
He put Christ to death on our behalf, and He has recognized the death of Christ as the full payment of our debt
Christ has died for my sins, and He is now at Your right hand as proof that You have received His payment of all my debts
By resurrecting Christ You indicated that You were satisfied with His payment and You issued a receipt of payment
God's righteousness is shown forth, in the forbearance of God, in His passing by of the sins that occurred before
During the Old Testament age, God neither condemned ones such as these to the lake of fire, nor did He forgive their sins
Their sins still existed, but they were covered by the type, by the blood of the sacrifices which typified the sacrifice of Christ
The propitiatory or expiatory sacrifice, which foreshadowed Christ, satisfied all the requirements of God's righteousness
Because His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, was put to death by Him on the cross on our behalf, He is legally obligated to forgive us
Hebrews 1:3 says that after Christ made purification for sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high
Whenever our conscience condemns us because of our failures, we need to remember to stand upon the foundation of God's righteousness
In the future, you may fail Him and therefore become very disappointed with yourself, unable to believe that God could ever forgive you
Tell Him that no matter how much you have failed, Christ is still at His right hand as the receipt for payment for all your debts
Whenever we claim the blood of Jesus and appeal to God's righteousness, God has no choice except to forgive us
The foundation is not our fervency or victory; it is God's righteousness, the unshakable foundation of God's throne
In 1 Corinthians we have the matter of objective righteousness, but in 2 Corinthians, subjective righteousness
As the members of Christ, Christ is being wrought into us to transform us gradually from sin into righteousness
In other words, positionally we are righteous in the eyes of God, but dispositionally we are not yet the righteousness of God
Because we have this position and foundation, we have the boldness to tell God that He has no right to forsake us
You have raised Him from the dead and caused Him to sit at Your right hand as proof that You have received His death as payment for my sins
At the last minute, He could have decided to let us all perish and to create a new human race for the fulfillment of His purpose
As we have pointed out, now that Christ has died for our sins and has been resurrected for our justification, God cannot change His mind
If we would know the gospel of the Son of God thoroughly, we need to see that God's selection is included in it
God's selection, on the contrary, does not depend upon what we are; it depends entirely upon God and His desire
As Paul says in 9:16, 'So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One Who shows mercy'
Before we were born, He selected us and predestinated us and arranged everything related to us, including the time and place of our birth
On the one hand, it is wonderful to be a Christian; but on the other hand, it is extremely trying and difficult
A number of unbelievers may attend the same meeting and hear the same message; however, only certain ones respond
One day a student expressed the concern that through his preaching of the gospel someone could be saved who had not been selected by God
If we would properly serve God in the gospel of His Son, we must know that the gospel includes the selection of grace
Some can testify that although they are in the Lord's recovery today, those who brought them to this way did not come this way themselves
We are not in the Lord's recovery because we are more intelligent than others or because we seek the Lord more than others do
If you consider how the Lord brought you into the church life in the Lord's recovery, you will worship Him for His mercy
Regarding the gospel, the ministry of life, and the church life in the Lord's recovery, God has had mercy upon us
We should have no trust in ourselves, and we should not think we are here because of anything that we are or that we have done
Our being in the Lord's recovery today is not of our willing nor of our running, but of God, the One who shows mercy
If we worship the Lord for His mercy and experience Him bearing us in bearing the responsibility, our inward taste will be as sweet as honey
We need to see that the selection of grace does not depend on us, but depends on God's selection of us before the world began
If we see this, we shall turn our eyes away from ourselves and from our circumstances and gaze steadfastly upon Him
The fact that God's selection is wholly a matter of His grace does not mean that we are free to do whatever we want
If this is our attitude, then we either have not been selected by God or we are backsliders from God's selection
In this message we shall consider the practice of the Body life as it is presented in the closing chapters of Romans
Sonship includes designation, resurrection, justification, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation
We are presently undergoing the process of designation; that is, we are being designated sons of God by the power of resurrection
These groups of believers did not realize that the Body life depends on sonship, which comes out of designation
If we are to have the proper practice of the Body life, we must be transformed according to the power of resurrection
Someone may have a heart for the Body life, but if he does not present his body, he is not for the Body life in a practical way
If we are conformed to today's religion, we shall be useless as far as the practice of the Body life is concerned
Just as Judaism was part of the age in Paul's time, so Christianity as an organized religion is part of today's age
The teaching in Romans concerning the Body life is in chapter twelve, but the practice is in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen
As we consider Paul's approach to these problems, we can learn something related to the daily practice of the Body life
In chapter fourteen Paul addresses the problem of receiving believers whose opinions and practices differ from ours
The first example concerns eating: 'One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables'
If we have the proper practice of the Body life we shall receive all true believers in Christ whether they practice immersion or sprinkling
If someone comes to us with a different opinion regarding a particular matter, we must still receive him as a brother in the Lord
The importance of receiving the believers is illustrated by an experience we had during the early days of the church life in Los Angeles
One group had a background of Pentecostalism, and another group had a background of fundamental Bible teaching
The Lord can testify on our behalf that in our practice of the church life we have been general, receiving all different kinds of believers
He expressed a general attitude toward all believers; he despised neither those who ate only vegetables nor those who ate everything
Some may oppose this and condemn it as being disorderly, whereas those who favor it may seek to impose it on others
There may be differences not only among believers in a local church but also between local churches themselves
If you visit a church that differs in practice from the church in your locality, do not try to correct it or to change anything
We shall have not only the doctrine of the Body in Romans 12, but also the practice of the Body life in Romans 14
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
As long as we have righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, we should not be concerned about differences in doctrine or practice
If you have the proper concept, you will realize that your hospitality is not simply to certain saints, but to the whole church
If we would have the proper practice of the Body life today, we must be general in receiving all kinds of believers
To say that revelation is implied means that it is not conveyed directly and explicitly, but that it is implied by what is directly conveyed
The dispensation of the Triune God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose has much to do with the local churches
The Triune God is not for doctrine or for theology, but for dispensing Himself into His people in order to have a Body to express Christ
For God to dispense Himself into His chosen people, He must be triune; that is, He must be God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit
Although our God is triune, we reject tritheism, which is the doctrine that the Three of the Trinity are three distinct Gods
How can we explain, then, that the unique God sent His own Son when Christ is both the Son of God and God Himself?
According to verse 4, Christ was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead
Although the word dispensation is found neither here nor in the remainder of the book of Romans, the fact of dispensation is still implied
In the span of a few verses, four divine titles are interchangeably used: God, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ
In the New Testament, phrases such as the love of God and the life of God mean that love and life are God Himself
Paul's thought goes from God to the Spirit of God, from the Spirit of God to the Spirit of Christ, and from the Spirit of Christ to Christ
According to verse 11, the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us; that is, His Spirit makes His home in us
In verse 11 we do not find the words triune or dispensing, but the fact of the dispensation of the Triune God is implied
In order for the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead to dwell in us, God had to become involved in a process
Perhaps you may desire to go to a certain place, but instead the Spirit leads you to the meeting of the church
We often are inclined to do things that are contrary to God's nature, but the indwelling Spirit is stronger than we are
The fact that we are God's sons in life is proved by the sense of sweetness we enjoy whenever we call, 'Abba, Father'
We may think that we alone are praying, only to discover that our prayer actually comes from the indwelling Spirit
Because we are one with Him and the Spirit is mingled with our spirit, we cannot always discern what is of us and what is of Him
The ultimate issue of the dispensation of the Triune God is to produce sons to be the members which constitute the Body of Christ
These verses indicate that in the book of Romans righteousness is a footing, a standing, a base, for God's dispensation
In the same principle, if there were no righteousness in society or in our personal life, both society and our personal life would collapse
In His economy the Triune God desires to dispense Himself into the three parts of man, into man's spirit, soul, and body
If God does not meet the requirements of His righteousness, He cannot carry out the dispensation of Himself into us
We may not be aware of the demands of God's holiness and glory; we may have no realization that glory is one of God's requirements
Genesis 3:24 indicates that as soon as man fell, he could not meet the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory
Because man had fallen and had become sinful, the way to the tree of life was barred by God's righteousness, holiness, and glory
After the introduction and the section on condemnation , there are sections on justification , sanctification , and glorification
Only through the Son's seeking and finding and through the Spirit's enlightening can sinners return to the Father
Because of the redemptive death of His Son, the Father has the ground to receive all who come to Him through Christ
Apart from the incarnation and crucifixion of Christ, there is no way for the righteous God to receive us and to impart Himself into us
Before God could come into us, His Son became a man and died on the cross for us, shedding His blood to wash us from our sins
If we are not crucified on the cross, God's righteous requirements cannot be fulfilled in us in a practical way
Because God's righteousness has been satisfied, God is justified in dispensing Himself into His redeemed and crucified people
God cannot dispense Himself into persons still living in their natural life, but can only dispense Himself into those who have died
If you are still alive in a natural way, still living in sin and in the world, God has no position to dispense Himself into you
If we want to experience the dispensation of the Triune God, we must take our standing before Him as crucified persons
Since we are then dead with Christ in a practical way, God will have the position to dispense Himself into us with all His riches
The name Jesus is related to His death, and the title Christ Jesus is related to resurrection and the impartation of life
The death of Jesus was for the fulfillment of God's righteousness, but the resurrection of Christ is for God's holiness
God's righteous procedure is upheld by the death of Christ, but God's nature is imparted into us through the resurrection of Christ
Sanctification involves a long process which begins when we are saved and continues throughout our Christian life
Christ's death is for God's righteousness, His resurrection is for God's holiness, and His ascension is for God's glory
The whole creation is eagerly expecting to 'be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God'
When we realize the fact that we share in Christ's ascension, we experience not only sanctification, but also glorification
To be crucified with Christ is to experience righteousness, and to have Christ live in us is to experience holiness
According to His righteousness and through His holiness, the Triune God is dispensed into us in a full way unto His glory
When people contact us or visit our homes, they should be able to sense that we have died with Christ and that Christ is living in us
In Romans 6 through 8 we see that we are being sanctified through the living acting moving and working of the resurrected Christ within us
If we daily take our stand of having died with Christ, we shall have the subjective experience of righteousness
Because we all have died in Christ and are therefore righteous in the eyes of God there is no ground for Satan to accuse us or to condemn us
In every church there must be the base of God's righteousness, the process of God's holiness, and the goal of God's glory
God's dispensation, therefore, is according to His righteous way, through His holy nature, and unto the expression of Himself
In the foregoing message we pointed out that God's righteousness is related to the death of Christ, which terminated all negative things
The death of Christ terminated these unrighteous things and fulfilled the requirements of the righteousness of God
The death of Christ was not the end, for it ushered in the resurrection, in which we are germinated and generated
With the resurrection of Christ there is the function of sanctifying, which includes transforming and conforming
If we had been present at the meeting of the church on the day of Pentecost, we would have exclaimed, 'What glory'!
We would not have spoken about righteousness or sanctification, for we would have had an overwhelming sense of glory
The Lord Jesus began His prayer in John 17 with the words, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
If we gather together as the church in a normal way, we should have the sense that there is glory in our meetings
The dispensation of the Triune God is according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto the goal of His glory
From the center through the middle to the circumference, the life of the Triune God is being dispensed into our entire being
The Spirit and Christ, the Son, are mentioned explicitly, whereas God the Father is implied by the fact that the Spirit is the Spirit of God
In Genesis 1:1 this life could not be dispensed into man, for as yet it had not passed through the necessary stages
Romans 8:10 says, 'If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
If we see this, we shall have the boldness to declare to the whole universe and especially to Satan that our spirit is life
May we see not only that we are saved and regenerated, but also that the innermost part of our being has become life
If your wife or husband gives you a difficult time, do not argue, but tell the one troubling you that your spirit is zoe
Confucius was a great ethical philosopher who taught his disciples to develop what he called the inner bright virtue
After listening to them for a while, we would tell them that what they had was nothing in comparison to what we had
We told them that what they have may be a bright virtue something created by God but what we have is the very Creator of this bright virtue
We helped them see that this Creator has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
By preaching the gospel on a high level in this way, we brought a good number of professors, doctors, nurses, and lawyers to the Lord
We all need to see the vision of the dispensing of the life of the Triune God into the three parts of our being
Through such a dispensing the Triune God becomes one with the tripartite man, and the tripartite man becomes one with the Triune God
By creation man had both the image of God and the likeness of God, but he did not have in him the reality of God
As regenerated persons, we not only bear the image of God and have the likeness of God, but we also have within us the reality of God
The fact that we are vessels to honor prepared unto glory means that we have been designed to contain God as our honor and glory
Because we were created according to the likeness of God, we have the capacity to be godly, that is, to be like God
In His creation of man, God made man as a vessel to contain Him with the intention of coming into this vessel and filling it with Himself
No more are we veiled to the fact that man is a vessel to contain God and that God feels at home in such a wonderful vessel
If we see this, then we shall be able to understand the subject of this message: not an exchanged life, but a grafted life
The vessel may be earthy, not at all honorable or glorious, whereas the content is altogether honorable and glorious
When such a content is dispensed into the earthy vessel, the vessel becomes a vessel of honor, a vessel of glory
In 11:17-24 Paul uses the illustration of branches from a wild olive tree being grafted into a cultivated olive tree
As a result of grafting, the branches from the wild olive tree and the cultivated olive tree grow together organically
In this procedure healthy skin is transplanted from one part of a patient's body to a wound or burn elsewhere in his body to form new skin
After the graft is completed, the transplanted skin will grow organically with the tissue to which it has been grafted
According to this hymn, he realized that it was a grafted life, a life in which two parties are joined to grow organically
The divine life cannot be grafted with the life of a dog because there is no resemblance whatever between these lives
Because our human life was made in the image of God and according to the likeness of God, it can be joined to the divine life
In the same principle, when we are grafted into Christ, Christ swallows up our defects, but He does not eliminate our own life
Just as antibiotics kill disease germs, so the killing element in the life of Christ terminates the negative things in us
Rather he said Grace be with you The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit or simply The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit
On the day we believed we were not only saved, but we were also married to Christ in spirit, and a union between us and Him took place
As we continue to contact Him, the superior elements of the divine life swallow up the inferior elements of our human life
Because we have been grafted into Christ and are living in oneness with Him, our speaking is spontaneously His speaking
Paul had no commandment of the Lord regarding this matter, but he spoke as one who loved the Lord and lived out the Lord in a practical way
As we read 1 Corinthians 7 today, we receive the whole chapter as the oracle of God, as part of God's holy Word
According to the principle of incarnation, Christ had been incarnated into Paul, and Paul lived not an exchanged life, but a grafted life
May we all be impressed with the fact that the Christian life is not a matter of exchange, but a matter of grafting
According to God's revelation and according to our experience, we see that as Christians today we have a wonderful grafted life
In recent messages we have seen the matter of the dispensation of the Triune God and the matter of the grafted life
In order to see this, we need to ask the Lord to remove all the veils that keep us from receiving a true understanding of this book
We may read the book of Romans again and again, but we may not know that we are covered by layer upon layer of veils
In 12:2 Paul speaks of transformation: 'And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
Although Paul mentions Satan's goal of conformation on the negative side, he does not here speak of the object of transformation
From the time God created us in His image and according to His likeness, we were ready to receive Him into us as life
Contacting some young fishermen in Galilee, He said, 'Follow Me,' and they followed Him, although He seemingly had nothing
If Christ were still just among us, His life could not be grafted together with ours, because He would not be in us
In order to be qualified to enter into us, Christ had to pass through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Included in this dose is the killing power of the crucifixion of Christ that puts to death the negative elements of our human life
It resurrects the elements originally created by God in His image and after His likeness for the fulfillment of His purpose
Remember, the Bible says not only that we have been crucified with Christ, but also that we have been resurrected with Him
Both the effectiveness of crucifixion and the power of resurrection are included in the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit
The corrupted element of our human life is crucified and buried, but the positive element is uplifted in resurrection
As we inwardly experience crucifixion, burial, and resurrection, we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ
In 8:2 Paul speaks of the Spirit of life, and in 8:10 he says that our 'spirit is life because of righteousness'
Through the growth and function of the divine life within us God will reach His goal to produce many sons to form the Body to express Christ
Today Christ, the Son of God, is no longer simply the only begotten Son, but also the firstborn among many brothers
According to God's sovereignty in creation, the human life is similar to the divine life, just as a glove is similar to a hand
On the cross, He not only accomplished redemption, but also terminated all the negative things in the universe
After crucifixion and burial He entered into resurrection with His divine elements and was then able to germinate generate and transform us
In His ascension Christ has been exalted, glorified, and enthroned and has been given the headship, the lordship, and the kingship
Through this mingled and grafted life we shall be fully transformed and conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son
In Exodus 30 we have the compound ointment, an ointment composed of olive oil, which signifies the Holy Spirit, compounded with four spices
In Old Testament times, before the Spirit was compounded, the Spirit was merely the Spirit of God, signified by the oil
The Holy Spirit today is the compound Spirit, the compound ointment with the elements of humanity, death, and resurrection
Although the child may refuse to take the medicine itself, the child will drink it when it is part of such a compound beverage
In this Spirit are divinity, humanity, and Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, this all-inclusive Spirit with all these marvelous ingredients comes into us
In 65 Paul says For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection
On the one hand, we have grown together with Christ, but, on the other hand, we shall be growing in the likeness of His resurrection
As a believer experiences a proper baptism, the divine Spirit within him puts to death the old man with his worldly, sinful elements
Through such growth we experience the application of our crucifixion with Christ which was accomplished more than nineteen hundred years ago
No longer is our crucifixion with Christ a mere theory, doctrine, or belief that has no practical effect on our living
If our husband or wife gives us a difficult time, we can experience at that very moment the application of Christ's death
The heavenly antibiotic not only crucifies us, but also resurrects us and renews the faculties of our mind, emotion, and will
If we would be transformed, we must constantly look to the Lord, pray, read the Word, and call on the name of the Lord
As we gaze upon Christ and reflect Him, we are transformed into His image from glory to glory, that is, from one degree of glory to another
Through this process of transformation and conformation, we are brought fully into the divine sonship to be members of the Body of Christ
When we see the vision of transformation and conformation by the grafted life, 6:8 will become real in our practical experience
Every kind of life has four basic features: the life-essence, the life-power, the life-law, and the life-shape
Although the essence of a certain life may be abstract and mysterious, the life itself is powerful in a very substantial way
Because of the life-law that controls its growth, a carnation plant will not produce roses, but carnation flowers
There is no need for us to pray about it; the law of life in the carnation plant functions automatically to direct its development
As the divine life grows within us and transforms us, it spontaneously shapes us into the pattern, the image, of the firstborn Son of God
Concerning this, only one thing is prevailing-the divine life that grows in us, sanctifies us, transforms us, and shapes us
God created us with a mind, emotion, will, soul, heart, and spirit, and He intends to bring all these aspects of our being into resurrection
Wherever we may be, we should display the highest character, because our natural faculties have been uplifted by the divine life
The condemnation in chapters two and three is something before God, not something according to our inward sense or consciousness
Before we were saved, we probably did not have any realization that in the sight of God we were condemned according to His righteous law
If we read chapter seven carefully, we shall see that it describes a war within the various parts of our being
We may take sides with this good part and stand with it against the other part, but we always suffer defeat and lose the battle
We have pointed out that in 7:23 Paul speaks of being made a captive in the law of sin which is in his members
We are not captured by giant enemies outside of us, but by small enemies within us, for example, by our temper
If a Christian does not love the Lord very much, or if he does not make up his mind to please the Lord, these enemies will not bother him
Paul begins chapter eight with a word concerning condemnation: 'There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus'
According to chapter seven, sin must be a person, for it can war against us, deceive us, kill us, and capture us
The fact that sin can deceive and kill indicates that it is not only something personified, but that it is a person
Incarnation refers to one thing which formerly was outside another thing entering into that thing and becoming one with it
The answer is that God condemned sin in the flesh of Jesus Christ, the One who was sent in the likeness of the flesh of sin
Those who crucified the Lord Jesus did not know what was taking place in the spiritual world while the Lord was on the cross
According to Colossians 2:15, God the Father came in to clear the way so that Christ's crucifixion would not be frustrated
The expression 'according to flesh' refers to the physical realm, but the expression 'according to spirit' refers to the spiritual world
We need to consider whether we are living in the flesh, in the physical world, or in the spirit, in the spiritual world
Here Paul refers not to keeping the law but to the fulfilling of the righteous requirements of the law in those who walk according to spirit
The requirements of the law are fulfilled not in those who keep the law, but in those who walk according to spirit
All that Paul covers in the remainder of chapter eight is related to the working of the law of the Spirit of life
It would also be helpful to trace Paul's thought concerning this matter backward from chapter eight to chapter five
It is crucial for us to see that the subject, the topic, of Romans 8 is not merely the Spirit, but the law of the Spirit of life
In verse 34 Paul refers to the ascension when he tells us that Christ is at the right hand of God interceding for us
In 8111 we see that after having passed through the various processes the Triune God became a lifegiving Spirit the Spirit who gives life
The second aspect is found in verse 6: 'For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace'
According to verse 11, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead gives life to our mortal bodies through the indwelling Spirit
Life is imparted to us in a threefold way: Our spirit becomes life, our mind becomes life, and life is imparted to our mortal bodies
The law of sin and of death is the person of Satan, and the law of the Spirit of life is the Person of the Triune God
The negative law, the law of sin and death, is also a person- Satan, the Devil, the one who has the power of death
In the same principle, if the Triune God had remained outside of us, He could not be to us the law of the Spirit of life
How wonderful that, after being processed, the Triune God has been installed in us and works within us not by activity, but by law!
Would it not be foolish to telephone the power plant and beg someone to turn on the lights or operate our appliances?
No one who has even the most elementary knowledge of electricity would ever call the power plant and beg for electrical power
Those who have the knowledge that electricity has been installed will simply turn on the switch and apply the power
Often we Christians are like persons who call a power plant for electricity when all that is needed is to turn on the switch
You simply switch on the air conditioner and go to sleep, enjoying the cool air supplied by the air conditioner
In a message to come we shall point out that since we are already in the spirit, there is no need for us to get into the spirit
By His indwelling, He has made our spirit life, He is causing our soul to become life, and He is imparting life to our mortal bodies
We are now enjoying life in a threefold way by the working of this wonderful law, the law of the Spirit of life
The issue, the result, of these two steps is that the righteous requirement of the law is spontaneously fulfilled in us
The fulfillment of the righteous requirements of the law is an issue of the incarnation and crucifixion of Christ
Because the incarnate Christ has been crucified on the cross, the requirements of the law can be fulfilled in us automatically
In verse 4 Paul says that the requirements of the law are fulfilled 'in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit'
We may say that God had an open highway set before Him and that He would move on this highway to fulfill His intention
He says that they are fulfilled in us, the people who have been chosen, redeemed, visited, reached, and touched by God
Of placing a high value on ourselves and thinking of ourselves as precious, we may despise ourselves and hate ourselves
As children of God, we need to realize that when we speak something out of a sincere heart, our situation will be according to our speaking
Some teach that in order for a Christian to receive the Spirit, he must repent, confess his sins, and pray with fasting
Because of the influence from our religious background, we may hesitate to answer when someone asks us if we have received the Holy Spirit
Do you have the confidence to say that you walk according to spirit, that you are according to spirit, and that you are inspirit?
How can you claim to walk according to spirit and to be according to spirit when you are still troubled by your temper?
Walking according to spirit issues from being according to spirit, for what we do always comes out of what we are
Walking according to spirit comes out of being according to spirit, and being according to spirit comes out of being in spirit
Once we are in spirit, we shall be according to spirit, and once we are according to spirit, we shall walk according to spirit
My burden in this message is not on walking according to spirit or simply on being according to spirit; it is on being in spirit
We walk according to spirit because we are according to spirit, and we are according to spirit because we are in spirit
The word 'since' also refers to a condition, but to a condition which has already been fulfilled and has become an accomplished fact
In this sentence the word 'since' indicates a condition which has been fulfilled and is now an accomplished fact
For this reason, it is wrong to say that sometimes we are of Christ and that at other times we are not of Christ
In the foregoing message we pointed out that to be of Christ is a matter of position, but to be in spirit is a matter of condition
The position that we are of Christ is settled once for all; however, the condition of being in spirit may fluctuate
In the same principle, we do not always need to say, 'I am in spirit,' for it may be adequate simply to say the word 'in'
Neither did he teach that believers must confess all their sins to both God and man before they can experience the Spirit
To understand the matter of being in the spirit as mentioned in verse 9, it will be helpful to consider how we were saved
We see that when the gospel is preached, proclaimed to us, and we acknowledge it, we are immediately sealed with the Spirit of God
He may tell the new believer, 'Right now you are not only of Christ and of the Spirit, but you are also in the spirit
Whenever the thought or the desire comes to you to do something that is contrary to the Lord, you should declare, 'I am in the spirit'
The well-known chorus of a gospel song says, 'This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all the day long'
The more we make up our mind to behave ourselves for the glory of God, the more we become like the wretched man described in Romans 7
He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection and has become the life-giving Spirit
The reason for the difficulty is that this word refers to the mingled spirit, to the divine Spirit mingled with our regenerated human spirit
Verse 16 refers to these two spirits: 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God'
To say that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit indicates that the two spirits have been mingled and have become one
We have someone much higher than the President dwelling in us-we have the Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit!
In verse 14 we have the function of the Spirit's leading: 'For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God'
Many of us can testify that it is the Spirit who leads us to the church meetings when we may be inclined to do something else
Because of the witness of the Spirit, we have the confirmation and testimony within us that we are children of God
While we are enjoying the firstfruit of the Spirit, we are expecting in the future to enjoy the full taste, the redemption of our body
