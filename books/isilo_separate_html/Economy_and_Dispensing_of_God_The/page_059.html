In order to be built up, first we must grow into the Head, Christ, in all things (v. 15). Although some of us may love the Lord very much, we may still hold on to many things that the Lord does not want. As we are being perfected, and while we contact the Lord day after day, He will require that we give up some of these things. It may be a certain pair of shoes, a certain haircut, or make-up that He requires us to give up. If we want to have a part in the work of the New Testament ministry, we must grow up into Him in these things. Before we go to the barber shop, put on a dress, make any decision, or do anything, we need to pray to the Lord first. In this way, we will grow into Christ in all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Out from the Head, in the Divine Dispensing,<br>All the Body Joined Closely Together<br>through Every Joint of the Rich Supply,<br>and Knit Together, Interwoven, through<br>the Operation in Measure of Each One Part,<br>in the Divine Dispensing</H2><P>After we have grown up into Christ, something out from Him will be produced. This rich supply out from Him will be dispensed into us and will make us either a joint of the rich supply or a particular functioning part in the Body (v. 16). Our human body needs many joints. We can stretch our arms and legs in a flexible way because of the many joints in our arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, and toes. In addition, there are the many parts between the joints to function together according to their own measure. Although the arm may have a large measure, and the little finger may have a small measure, every member functions according to its own measure. In the same way, in the Body of Christ, there are many joints of the rich supply who are joined closely together. There are also many operating parts who are knit and interwoven together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Causing the Growth of the Body,<br>in the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity,<br>unto the Building Up of the Body Itself<br>in the Divine Love</H2><P>While the joints are supplying and the different parts are functioning, there will be the growth of the Body. This growth of the Body equals the building up of the Body directly by itself. The Body is not built up directly by the Head, nor is it built up directly by the gifted persons. It is built up directly by the perfected and functioning members. The work of the Head and the work of the gifted persons are indirect; the direct work is done by the members. As these members function, the Body grows, and this growth is the building up.</P><P>It is by the way of dispensing that the church as the organic Body of Christ is built up. The Father is dispensing, the Son is dispensing, and the Spirit is dispensing. Furthermore, all the gifted ones are dispensing, and all the perfected ones also are dispensing. It is through this dispensing of the divine life that the Body grows and builds up itself.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Berkeley, California, on September 1, 1990)</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> </body></html>
