   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN COMING TO THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reasons that our meetings do not interest people are because, on the one hand, we speak little and our experience is poor and, on the other hand, when we do stand up to speak the truth, we do not know how to change direction.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not mean that we must praise unceasingly; that is not so good either.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must also be able to turn again from God to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This way the taste will stay fresh and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even the older ones should also learn.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Anaheim a group of older brothers and sisters have moved there because their children have settled in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These older brothers and sisters are learning English very well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One sister who is eighty-one years old still goes to the community center to learn English, and the teachers and students in the whole class all consider her very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, I hope that the older brothers and sisters will be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we were here just to have worship services, it would be very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then as long as people attend the meetings, it would be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But these are the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our whole being should be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our body, soul, mind, and spirit all should be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we go to the field to play ball, as soon as we are in position, all our skills must be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even our clothing must be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we go to the meetings, we should also have a meeting conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>ADDING EXPOSITION, TESTIMONIES,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>PRAYER, AND HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The third verse in the Bible which proves that we need to coordinate with each other in speaking in the meetings is 1 Corinthians 14:26, Each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The three verses we have spoken of thus far tell us that there must be coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There needs to be coordination and cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever there is a lack in coordination, none of these three verses can be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From our experience, we see that four items need to be added.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first is to add exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A brother or sister may speak three to five sentences, yet not be able to fully express himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then you may add a little, but not merely in the way of repeating his words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Expounding is not to lengthen, but to strengthen and to uplift.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are only repeating what others have said, people will feel that it is too repetitious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To repeat would be unnecessary because everyone already understands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when you speak you must have the confidence that others will not be bored and that you are strengthening and uplifting, not repeating.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The second point is to add testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some brothers and sisters may speak in a good way, but you may have a testimony to add to their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That would be excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is like a person getting dressed; the color of his shirt should coordinate with the color of his pants.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You need to know how to coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This matching testimony really causes people to feel that the meeting has a pleasant taste.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The third point is to add prayer, and the fourth point is to add hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Exposition, testimonies, prayer, and hymns are four items that should not be lacking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is no strengthening word in the meeting, the sense will be that the meeting is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There must be the strengthening word, the strengthening testimonies, prayers, and hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These four items should be blended continuously: speaking, singing, praying, and testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a meeting has these four items, surely it will be rich and living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time, we need to practice in our exposition, our strengthening word, not to show off.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not to show others that I have again added a few sentences, and that I am better than them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our exposition is to strengthen the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not to correct others nor to show off ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The best way to learn to expound is to have those living in the brothers or sisters houses come together to practice expounding to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You speak, and I strengthen; I speak, and you strengthen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We first learn the basic skills at home.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The couples can also practice expounding at home.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let the wife speak first, and let the husband add a few sentences; then correct each other.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way it will be very easy to improve.</S>
