   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HELPING THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another burden of the training, which will be brought up in subsequent fellowship, is that every full-timer should help a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This does not mean we will lead the small groups; we will help them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, I am concerned that the full-timers may become proud upon hearing that they are qualified, designated, and commissioned to help the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, the brothers and sisters in the small groups may say, Didn t Brother Lee say that there are no responsible ones or leading ones in the small groups?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why then does he ask trainees to help us?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to see that in order to avoid doing things in a natural way in the small groups, the small groups need the help.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to help the small groups, the trainees need to know the complications related to a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Lord s recovery our practices are not mechanical or organizational; they are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, it is wrong for the full-time brothers and sisters to help the small groups in an organizational way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our help must be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not easy to know what is organic and what is organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the training we will be perfected to help the small groups, after which we will be assigned to a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our attitude is that we know how to help people and, hence, we are the coach, what we do will become organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should have the attitude of being a brother or a sister, who is a member of the Body, meeting together with our brothers and sisters in a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not feel that we are there to help others and that the other members must receive our help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must be organic in the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though this is not easy, if we learn, every small group will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, in a small group gathering, if a person suddenly brings food and invites everybody for a feast, should we join them?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or should we give a message telling them that a small group meeting should not be worldly?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the best way to handle the situation?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A brother may say that we need to turn to our spirit, eat in spirit, and bring everyone into Christ through eating.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This may sound good, but it is not so easy to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One way to handle the situation is to not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can simply eat with them, not expecting to do anything, because there is not much we can do under that kind of atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the best way is to not do anything and to not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just eat with them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After we finish eating, we should not look for an opportunity to correct them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if we would tell them that material things are a type of spiritual things, we should speak in a careful way, because if we are not careful in our speaking, it can be insinuating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The most appropriate way is to say something uplifting when we are invited to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should speak Christ but not say anything related to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Mentioning the food is like exposing a scar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must avoid speaking in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should only speak something inspiring so that they may get the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps we will not have the opportunity to help them on that day, or even on the second or third visit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we can endure until the fourth meeting, perhaps by then we will know how to work in a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The time will come when the Holy Spirit will prepare an environment to render help in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, as we go out to help people, we should not seek to be quick, nor should we focus on quick success.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It may be that we visit them for half a year, and we still cannot help them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please remember that there is no wasted effort.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as we are going, this is better than not going.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should realize that they are not completely without feeling concerning eating the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is some feeling in them, but how deep and how strong their feeling is depends on how much weight we have before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the apostle Paul were there, they would have a heavy feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, it is likely that due to our presence, they will begin to feel something.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we do not need to do something immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We simply need to go again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I believe that the Holy Spirit will give us an opportunity, and our effort will not be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To learn to not do anything is an important lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are doing a spiritual work, and this is the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May we all have this exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Gradually, the small groups will be delivered from the natural way of doing things, and people will receive the supply of life from us.</S>
