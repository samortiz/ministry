<h2 class="head1">THE LORD NOT WANTING US TO BE LEADERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">There Being No Leader among the Apostles</h2>
<p>There are many portions in the New Testament that show that the Lord does not want anyone to be a leader. In modern society every group has a leader. For example, among five members of a board of directors for a school, a president must be elected, or at least a convener must be chosen. In the New Testament, however, the Lord Jesus appointed twelve apostles, but He did not appoint a chief apostle among them, nor did they elect a leader among themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Being No Leaders in the Small Groups</h2>
<p>In the book of Acts the disciples were greatly multiplied in number. There were Jews who spoke Greek and Jews who spoke Hebrew, and the two groups could not communicate with each other. As a result, the daily dispensing was not done equally, and there were complaints. Then the twelve said, &ldquo;It is not fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables. But brothers, look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need. But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (6:2-4). Seven disciples were chosen to serve food, but no leader was chosen among them.</p>
<p>In the New Testament Paul speaks of appointing elders and of their qualifications, but he does not speak of electing a leader among the elders (Titus 1:5; 1 Tim. 3:1-7). Based on these examples, we do not have leaders in the small groups. If a brother says that he has been in the church life for more than twenty years, loves the Lord, and never misses a meeting but complains when another brother, who has been saved for only five years, is appointed as a leading one, his concept of position will become a source of stumbling. The desire to be a leader is a poison that only damages the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO DISTINCTION OF LEVEL<br />
AMONG THE ELDERS</h2>
<p>Among the co-workers and elders there are always some that are more spiritual and more experienced, who make decisions (cf. Acts 15:13-21). However, this does not mean that such brothers are the head. During the early period of the church, Peter took the lead and James followed. However, in Galatians 2 James was placed before Peter and John (v. 9). Later, James brought Judaism into the church, and this caused God to destroy the church in Jerusalem; even the entire city of Jerusalem was wiped out and totally destroyed.</p>
<p>These examples show that taking the lead is not the permanent responsibility of one person. In the New Testament no elder has a head position over other elders. All the elders are on the same level and have the same rank. There is no distinction of levels. The saints should not have to report every matter that needs a decision to the elders, nor do the elders in a meeting hall report to the elders in the central meeting hall for approval. Rather, the elders should fellowship among themselves.</p>
<p>However, the brothers in a meeting hall cannot say that baptism by immersion is too troublesome, and they will therefore baptize by sprinkling, because they do not have the authority to do so. There is no such constitution among us. Any person who would do such a thing would be writing his own constitution and is not under this ministry. Any change that is related to the truth must be based on the Bible. Whether to baptize people in the morning or evening, whether to use a big tub or a small tub, or whether to use cold water or warm water do not need to be reported to the elders. Such decisions should be made according to the practical situation in a hall.</p>
<p>If a matter cannot be worked out in a meeting hall, whether it is related to the work, the gospel in schools, the children&rsquo;s gospel, or the community gospel, I am open to fellowship with you. There are no levels in the church. For a matter that will affect all twenty-one meeting halls, any meeting hall can call an elders&rsquo; meeting. There is no convener among us. As long as a matter concerns the whole church, any elder can call an elders&rsquo; meeting, and the elders in the twenty-one meeting halls should come and fellowship together.</p>
<p>We hope that we can be exercised not to have a leader. Leaders do not exist in the New Testament. If we remove the leaders, there will be no levels among us. The deacons should not regard the elders as their boss. According to the teaching of the Bible, the elders are appointed by God and so are the deacons. In the past our view concerning this point was not correct.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Elders and Deacons Both Having Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Perhaps the brothers and sisters would ask how to practically carry out this fellowship. The elders have their responsibilities and so do the deacons. The responsibilities of the elders are not under those of the deacons, nor are the responsibilities of the deacons under those of the elders. According to the Bible, the elders should take care of shepherding and overseeing, and the deacons take care of various affairs. For example, the matters related to cleaning are carried out by the deacons and do not need to be reported to the elders. Once a matter related to cleaning requires an elder&rsquo;s approval, levels are produced. In our study of the Bible for the past years, we have found neither leaders nor levels in the New Testament. In the New Testament there is only fellowship and coordination. When the elders decide on what needs to be done for a conference, including set-up, cleaning, and ushering, they often assign subordinates to carry out each task. This way of doing things is according to the way of the world, not according to the teaching of the Bible.</p>
