   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Going Up to the Mountain Privately to Pray</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After performing the miracle, the Lord went up to the mountain privately to pray Matt 14:23; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Luke 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>a. Not Remaining in the Issue of the Miracle</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>with the Crowds</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord did not remain in the issue of the miracle with the crowds but went away from them privately to be with the Father on the mountain in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we go to a certain place and have a great success, would we leave right away or would we remain in this big success to enjoy it?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to see and follow the pattern of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not remain in the issue of the great miracle which He performed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, He went up to the mountain privately to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word privately is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means He did not let the people know He was going to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, they would have followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He went away from them privately to be with the Father in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I like these three phrases: to be with the Father, on the mountain, and in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should learn from the Lord s pattern here by exercising to be with Him on the mountain in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His looking up to heaven means that He had no trust in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His going up to the mountain means that He wanted to be with the Father in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To pray with others is good, but often we need to pray by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we pray with others, we cannot enjoy the Lord as deeply as when we pray to the Lord privately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even the Lord Jesus told us that when we pray we should shut our door privately and pray secretly to the Father who sees in secret Matt 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we have the sensation of how intimate He is to us and how close we are to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to learn to leave the crowds, our family, our friends, and the saints in the church to go to a higher level on a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to go higher, far away from the earthly things on a lower level.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to get to a higher level, separated from the crowd, to be with the Father privately and secretly to have intimate fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the significance of being on the mountain in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Asking the Father to Bless All Those Who Participated in the Enjoyment of the Issue of the Miracle</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to consider why the Lord Jesus went to the mountain right after this miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 6:27 gives us the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This verse says that after performing the miracle, the Lord said: Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, even God, sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord told the ones whom He fed not to seek the food that perishes, but to seek the food that abides unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe the Lord Jesus went to the mountain to pray in this way: Father, I pray to You under Your blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through Your blessing You fed the five thousand, but Father, they are just seeking for the food that perishes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do look unto You that You would bless them that they would seek the food that abides unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Father, You know that I am Your sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only I can give them the food that abides unto eternal life, but they do not know Me in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They know only that I can perform a miracle to feed them with physical food.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But they do not know that it is only I who can give them food that is of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe that the Lord prayed to bless them further in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His going up to the mountain privately to pray indicated His asking the Father to bless all those who had participated in the enjoyment of the issue of the miracle that they would not be satisfied with the food which perishes, but that they should seek for the food which abides unto eternal life and recognize that He was not only the Son of Man but also the Son of God who was sent and sealed by the Father and who could give them eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the five thousand were being fed by Him, they recognized that He was the capable Son of Man, but they did not realize that He was actually the Son of God who was not only sent but also sealed by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was the One who could give them the very bread that is related to the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, He had another teaching in John 6.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 6 the Lord revealed that He is the bread out of heaven, the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, He told us that this bread is just His word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life v. 63 . John 3:34 says that He is the One who speaks the word and gives the Spirit not by measure.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To know Him in this way requires a revelation, so He prayed for them privately on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Receiving Some Instruction from the Father</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His going up to the mountain privately to pray also indicated that He wanted to receive of the Father some instruction concerning how to take care of the five thousand people fed by His miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this crystallization-study of Matthew 14, we can see how much we need revelation from the Lord to see the intrinsic significance of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To see the miracle of feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fish is easy, but to know the deeper lessons which we have to learn from the Performer of this big miracle requires revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These lessons are intrinsic, deeper, and of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To know the great miracle the Lord performed does not give us any life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can only admire the Lord s outward doing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But to see all the detailed points concerning the lessons of life to learn from the Lord in His way of performing the miracle imparts life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to learn these living lessons from the Lord so that we can enter into the God-man living.</S>
