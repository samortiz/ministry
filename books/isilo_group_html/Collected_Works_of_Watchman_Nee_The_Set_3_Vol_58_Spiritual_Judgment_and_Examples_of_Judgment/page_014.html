First, your life of contradiction must be strengthened. Even when you do not find any interest in your work, you still have to go on. Second, you should be strengthened in resurrection. You may have experienced the first point; that is, you have lost your natural interest in the work. But in regards to the second point, you still have a responsibility and commitment, and you have no other choice but to carry this responsibility or else the church will collapse. You have to rise up above death and face the crises in the church. Some people work because they are driven by a lust for work; if we stop those who work in this way from working, we are asking them for their life. Brother, you have to be delivered from any lust for work. Any such lust has to be put to death. But then you must be strengthened in resurrection. You have to know that you are a servant of God. If He has a demand, He will surely give you the strength to meet this demand. When we are old, our service is no longer a matter of preference. The Lord told Peter that when he was young, he girded up his loins and walked wherever he wished. But when he was old, he would have to stretch out his hands, and another would carry him where he did not wish to go (John 21:18). This is the time when a worker is tested. The greatest test of our consecration is when we work for the Lord because we see His need. It is no longer a matter of preference but a matter of the Lord's demand. What we do during times of reluctance is more reliable than what we do during times of preference.</p><h2 class="head2">The Supply in the Body</h2><p>We do not work for God when we feel like it and stop when we do not feel like it. We have to work in resurrection and look for the supply in the Body. Resurrection is found in the church. Therefore, the supply of the resurrection life is also found in the church. We have to experience a breakthrough with all the saints through the supply of the Body. Let us forget about whether or not we have an interest or feeling concerning our work. When all the brothers and sisters give themselves to the church, they overcome together by the resurrection life. Paul was once discouraged. It seems as if he wanted a break from his work. Yet as soon as Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, he was immediately constrained by the word (Acts 18:5). He had been reasoning and persuading every Sabbath. Perhaps he was frustrated and ready to take a rest. Perhaps he was pressed beyond measure. But when Silas and Timothy showed up, he was constrained by the word. He continued to speak about Christ, returning to his former subject. Just when Paul was about to become discouraged, the coming of two young brothers strengthened his spirit. Perhaps you do not have two young brothers to come to your aid yet. But we hope that in the future they will come. It would not be right for you to retire now. If you set your eyes on the problems and do not draw supply from the power of resurrection, your problems will become heavy weights; they will not lead you anywhere. If you have the supply of the Body, your life of contradiction may increase while your natural interest dies out. (On the one hand, death is terrible, but on the other hand, it is very useful.) Under the operation of death, the power of resurrection will be manifested.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
