   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN AUTHORITY HAS TO BE RESTRICTED IN HIS EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Leviticus 10:1-7 records God's judgment on Nadab and Abihu.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They were judged because they did not come under the authority of their father Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Aaron had four sons, who served as priests in the sanctuary; they were anointed the same day that he was anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were not supposed to serve independently; rather, they were to help their father in his service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They could not do anything by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But one day Nadab and Abihu offered up strange fire on their own, without the command of their father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This brought in God's judgment, and they were burned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moses said, "This is what Jehovah spoke, saying, I will be sanctified by those who come near to Me" v. 3 . God wanted to point out that those who draw near to Him cannot be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This punishment was more severe and strict than His discipline on the rest of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nadab and Abihu died on the same day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What should Aaron have done?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before God he was the high priest; in his house he was the head of his household.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He played a double role.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Can a man be so dedicated to God's service that he can ignore his sons?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Jewish tradition, when a man dies, his family has to dishevel their hair and tear their garments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But Moses only ordered the corpses to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Aaron and his sons were not allowed to dishevel their hair or tear their garments.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sorrow and grief over death are human affections; they are normal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But here a servant of the Lord could not express his sorrow or else he would die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a very sober matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The judgment that a servant of God can suffer is different from the judgment that an ordinary Israelite can suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A servant of God cannot do what an ordinary Israelite can do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is understandable and legitimate for a father to mourn over his son or for a person to mourn over his own brother.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But those who have God's anointing oil upon them must sanctify themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not a matter of sin but a matter of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot say that we can do many things just because they are legitimate and not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of whether or not they are sinful, but whether we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It may be right for others to do them, but a servant of God cannot because he must sanctify himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The opposite of sanctification is being common.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be sanctified means that we cannot do what everybody else can do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord could not do what the disciples could do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An authority cannot do what his brothers can do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A high priest cannot even express his own emotion which he would otherwise be entitled to express.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he becomes loose in this matter, he will die.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Israelites died because of sin, while the priests died because of the failure of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among the children of Israel, those who kill die, but Aaron would die if he were to weep for his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What a difference this is!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>An authority must pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Aaron could not even leave the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He could only let others bury the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Israelites did not have to live in the tabernacle at all, yet Aaron and his sons could not even leave the door of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They had to carefully guard that which God had entrusted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The holy ointment has sanctified us and separated us from all our activities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to honor the ointment that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All of us have to go to God to deal with Him and to ask Him to separate us from others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The world and other brothers and sisters may maintain their family affections, but a deputy authority is set apart to maintain God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He cannot seek for ease.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He cannot hold on to his own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He cannot rebel or be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He must instead exalt God for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A servant of God is one who has God's holy ointment upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He must sacrifice his own emotion and abandon his legitimate sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the only way to become a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Anyone who maintains God's authority must also reject his own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One must be willing to pay any price, even to the extent of giving up his deepest affections, his filial sentiments, his friendships, and even his love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If he is entangled by these things, he cannot serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's requirements are strict.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a man does not give up his own affections, he cannot serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's servants are those with a distinction, while ordinary people are those without a distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's servants must sanctify themselves for the sake of His people.</S>
