   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Sister Bao Hsu-min,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sien-You, Fukien</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There were not many people in the edification meetings for the sisters in Sien-You, but it was of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank Him for manifesting His presence and His co-laboring.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the morning we added a meeting for preaching the gospel and simple Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sister Wang Yu-ju was responsible for it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He gave Sister Wang good health and a good voice; she was able to preach messages and do translation for several days without getting tired.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There will be a meeting to preach salvation to women in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are still before God about it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please pray concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yesterday, I received The Normal Christian Church Life from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I really thank God for His mercy in allowing His children to see His light more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am doing my best to read it through with prayer, and I also ask God to bless this book and give grace to all its readers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that those who care for God's work and the church and who are willing to keep the truth will be able to obtain this book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>May the Lord return soon!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your little sister in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hsu-min</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>April 2</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Work in Northern Fukien</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have read the fifth issue of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I know that the Lord cares for each of His people and keeps them safe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also opens the door for the gospel to us in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We really thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May He greatly revive His work in these years!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I left Ku-Tien last month and went north to Sha County to work for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I returned to Yen-Ping on the third of the month.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The evening I arrived I began a conference in Yen-Ping with three meetings a day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is a good opportunity here.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the northern part of Fukien is really pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is very desolate!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we who are in the valley must hope that the co-workers on the mountain would be faithful to raise your hands for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please ask God to raise up His work in every place and to send more workers to continue His work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May His eternal purpose be quickly accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sister Ong Yu-bing arrived yesterday from Jien-Ou.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She will render some help to the women's work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After her work in Yen-Ping, she will go north.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I will probably continue moving south.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Chen Bi-yin</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>April 6</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Work at Yi-Hu, Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the twelfth of this month, two sisters, another brother, and I went to Yi-Hu to do some work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We witnessed the work of the Holy Spirit in this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some people were saved and others were edified.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Two marvelous things occurred during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A cloth merchant who was a nominal Christian came to listen to the word on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The second day he went into the countryside to sell his cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He tried to sell for a long time but could not make any sales.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While he was suffering, in his heart he prayed, "O God, if You want me to listen to the messages, let me sell ten dollars worth of cloth."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After this prayer, he immediately sold ten dollars worth of cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He came back right away to listen to the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was saved that evening.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There was another person who had left the truth for more than ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He had even burned his Bible and hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He returned to the Lord during this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His whole family now comes to hear the word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There were eight days of meetings in this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We returned safely home on the twenty-first.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The brothers and sisters here are at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brother Chen Wen-kwang's health is much better.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Perhaps he can come to Swatow in a little more than a month.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Your little brother,</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>James Chen</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>March 30</S>
