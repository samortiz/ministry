   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Not Provoking Children to Anger</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fifth, Paul showed us an important thing that parents should not do they should not provoke their children to anger Eph 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not Exercising Authority Excessively</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does it mean to provoke children to anger?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means the excessive use of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One can overpower his children with physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is always possible because parents are stronger than their children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Or one can try to subdue his children with financial power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He may say, "If you do not obey me, I will not give you any money.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you do not listen to me, I will take away your food and clothing."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the children depend on him for their living, he overpowers them with his money by threatening to withdraw his support.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some parents dominate their children with physical power, and others dominate them with their iron will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This can provoke their children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they are provoked, they will wait for the chance for their freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day they will break their bondage and seek total freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I know a brother whose father gambled, smoked, and behaved rudely at home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He embezzled public funds and was involved in many other unscrupulous businesses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But he still went to church, and he wanted all of his children to go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He would rebuke and punish them severely if they did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He ruined his children's taste for the family, all the while insisting that they go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, the brother said, "I vowed that when I grew up one day, I would never go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As soon as I could support myself, I was going to turn away from the church."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though he swore this way, eventually he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, he would have become another anti-Christian proponent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The father did not try to make his children love him, yet he demanded that his children go to church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This never works.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This provokes children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Parents should not exercise excessive authority over their children or provoke them to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They must never make their children hardened and rebellious toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I remember another man who is not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not long ago I saw him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was forced to read the Bible when he was growing up at home, and he was forced to read the Bible when he went to a parochial school.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not saying that parents should not charge their children to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am saying that you must attract them and be an example to them yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It will never work if you merely tell them that the Lord is precious, yet constantly abuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There was a mother who was a nominal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She had a terrible temper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She insisted that her son read the Bible and go to a parochial school.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One day he asked when he could stop reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His mother replied, "When you finish secondary school, you can stop reading the Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the day that he received his high school diploma, he took his three copies of the Bible and burned them in the backyard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You must draw children in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, when their anger is provoked they may do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You want them to be good, but they will rebel against you when they become free.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what is meant by provoking children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not provoke your children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You must learn to be proper parents, to have love, tenderness, and a proper testimony before them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must also be an attraction to them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not exercise your authority excessively.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Authority can only be exercised under self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you are excessive in your use of authority, you will stifle your relationship with your children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Showing Proper Appreciation</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition, you should show proper appreciation for your children when they perform well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some parents only know how to punish and scold; they know nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This easily provokes their children to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Please remember that many children do have a desire to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you have nothing for them except punishment and rebuke, they will become disheartened, according to Paul's word in Colossians 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They will say that it is useless to do good because their parents will not acknowledge it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You must encourage your children when they perform well.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You can say to them, "Today you have done well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I will reward you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I want to give you something special."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Children do need to be disciplined, but they also need to be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Otherwise, they will become disheartened.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I read of a story about a little girl whose mother only knew how to beat and scold her children.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The child had a good disposition when she was young.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since she felt that her mother did not approve of her, she decided that she would work especially hard one day to try to please her.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When evening came, her mother undressed her, put her to bed, and began to walk away.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As the mother was walking away, the daughter called to her.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The mother asked what she wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When the mother started to walk away again, the daughter called again.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the mother asked her again, the daughter said, "Mother, do you not have anything to say?"</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is one of the stories told by Mr. Bervin.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After the mother left, the girl cried for two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Her mother was too insensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>She only knew how to beat and scold her daughter; she was insensitive to everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Please remember that the New Testament has more teaching for parents than for children.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The whole world speaks of the mistakes that children make, but the Lord spoke of the mistakes that parents make.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since the world speaks so much about children's mistakes, we do not have to say too much about them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Bible tells us parents can indeed provoke their children to anger and dishearten them through their insensitivity.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is why it speaks so much about parenting.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This occupation is more difficult than any other occupation in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Those who are parents must devote all their energy and mind to be proper parents.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Please do not be insensitive to your children.</S>
