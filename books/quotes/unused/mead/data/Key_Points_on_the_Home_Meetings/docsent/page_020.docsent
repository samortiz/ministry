   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may sing a hymn to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everyone loves music.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although he may refuse to believe in Jesus, his heart is not made of iron or stone but of flesh.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you preach the gospel, do not argue with people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not be inflexible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they will not believe, do not insist that they believe or tell them that if they do not believe, they will go to hell.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must change your way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they reject the gospel, you should not say anything to further provoke them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, you may say, Let me sing a hymn to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then begin to sing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you keep singing, they will be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us sing another hymn:</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I like this hymn very much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I call this The Hymn of a Sinner s History because it persuades people to believe in the Lord on the one hand, and it tells the history of the sinner on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse three says:</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Dying years, increasing yet decreasing,</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Apparently, our years are increasing; actually, they are decreasing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As your age increases by a year, your life decreases by a year.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our age is like a bank deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our savings are limited, but our spending is continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With money there is still the possibility of control, but you have no way to control your age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this reason, man is somewhat disappointed with his life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you come to verse three, you can start preaching the gospel: O friends, you are living in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You are in the hand of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your end is just death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Time is passing by, day by day.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But when the Lord Jesus came, He died to bruise the devil, and bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A person without the Savior is like a man under the hand of a surgeon on the operating table; he is being cut at the surgeon s will.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the Lord came, and He nullified death and manifested life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You should tell your friends that although they have grieved the Lord, He is still ready to save.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although they have rejected Him, He is still waiting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You should sing gospel songs to your relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You should also help them to sing along with you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sometimes it is better to sing than to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Let us sing together hymn 1065:</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Jesus sets me free!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hymns, #1065</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Parents like to hear their children sing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When you visit your relatives, you may first give their children some candy and then teach them to sing a simple hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Their parents may be unhappy if you persuade them to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But they will pay much attention to their children s singing.</S>
