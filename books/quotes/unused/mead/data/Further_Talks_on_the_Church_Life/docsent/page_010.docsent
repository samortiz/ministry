   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Vessel Needed to Contain God's Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some of us pray that the Lord would bless us as He blessed the church during Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But if the Lord really answered our prayers, what would we do?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the Lord really granted us the blessing of Pentecost, what would we do?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the Lord gave us three thousand or five thousand people, what would we do?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If several thousand people suddenly filled our meeting place, we would immediately see that we would not be able to absorb them all.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If three thousand people were added in Shanghai at one time, we could not absorb them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We would not know how to baptize them, how to divide them into different home meetings for the Lord's table, how to edify them, and how to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, when God blesses and the church is strong, we can easily absorb them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regardless of how many come, we will not drag along through our inability to handle them adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We now have about fifteen to sixteen hundred brothers and sisters among us; our fellowship is not adequately covered already.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What would we do if another thousand were added?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It would be hard for us to bear them if God should bless us with that many.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not talking about an organization but a container that can bear God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God blessed us by giving us three thousand and then two thousand disappeared after two days, this would not be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not know when people come and when people go, or how many have been added or how many have been lost, this is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is a container of such capacity that it is able to contain God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A church is supposed to attain to such a degree that when God blesses abundantly blesses there is a vessel which is able to contain this blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When all the brothers and sisters obey the Holy Spirit, they will all rise up to serve and receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one will bring in his own opinions, but everyone will be occupied with service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When this happens, God's church will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are not getting ready for the Holy Spirit's work, He will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be prepared for the Holy Spirit's work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must always prepare more room.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We would rather let the Lord bring people in than let Him take people out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Holy Spirit begins to work, we will really see that there is not enough room.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must prepare for the Holy Spirit's work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must prepare a larger meeting place and enlarge our capacity; then the Lord will bless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must prepare men for service; then the Lord will bless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not prepare everyone for service, the Holy Spirit will have no way to work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All Must Learn to Serve</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope the brothers and sisters will see that the ground of the church is based on locality and on the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the authority of the Holy Spirit to come in means that every person learns to reject his own ideas and submit to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As everyone learns to serve, the church of God appears.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the church, it is not sufficient that our own personal opinions are denied.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the positive side, everyone must submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once we submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit immediately will direct and instruct everyone to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would ask the leading brothers, especially the leading ones in the home meetings, to excuse me for saying the following words: The minimum responsibility you have before God is to serve, but this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you can only serve but cannot bring others into service, you have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Holy Spirit is directing every person to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the negative side, do not bring in your own ideas; on the positive side, let the Holy Spirit direct everyone to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The authority of the Holy Spirit means that the Holy Spirit can pass through everyone, the Holy Spirit can direct everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, whoever can only serve by himself, but cannot commit things to others, is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whoever does not hold responsibility in his own hands, but distributes it to the brothers and sisters that they may share in the same work, is useful in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not think that we must do everything when situations arise.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who hurriedly finish things themselves, who hold things in their hands, and who will not assign them to others are hindering the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Responsibilities must be distributed; they should not be retained in our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Retaining things in our own hands is a hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Things should not get stuck to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the authority of the Holy Spirit is given full freedom in the church, it no longer is a matter of doing it or not, but it is a matter of letting the Holy Spirit have the freedom to release Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the authority of the Holy Spirit works, moves, and is released in the whole Body, that is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The work must always be distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Distribution is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever a responsibility comes upon us, we should distribute it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A thing may be done by one person, or it may be done by five persons.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is better, however, to distribute it among five persons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Always be involved and always involve others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we practice this, we are training the brothers and providing them the proper guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way, everyone will learn to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brother Witness Lee and I have had a long time of looking to the Lord and conversing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We believe all the more in what we have seen before.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the days ahead God will certainly take the way of migration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, every brother must be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not hope that people will migrate to Nanchang in the future, yet expect the church in Nanchang to train them for us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to train them now.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am afraid that the brothers and sisters have no training before God, and when the time of migration arrives, such ones will not be able to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, everyone must learn something concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must learn much more before God regarding how the whole Body serves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do this, there will be a way for God to go out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A message by Watchman Nee, recorded by Brother Kun-min and others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>April 1, 1950</S>
