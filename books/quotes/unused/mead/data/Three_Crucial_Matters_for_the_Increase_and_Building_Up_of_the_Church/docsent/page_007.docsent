   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEETINGS NEEDING TO NOURISH AND TEACH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord s table meetings should not be longer than one hour.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The remaining half hour can be used to read a life-nourishing message.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to my observation, even though we spend the time after remembering the Lord to share our testimonies, there is not much enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people do not speak in the meetings because they are afraid that if they speak, they will expose their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This gives those who do not care about being exposed the opportunity to speak in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, their speaking is not short; they speak for a long time and ruin everyone s appetite for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The responsible brothers are afraid of offending those who speak long and do not say anything to them; thus, everyone must endure their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From now on, after breaking bread, those who have something of content should share it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After their sharing, we will read a life-nourishing message together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one should speak carelessly on matters that are unrelated to the topic of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must ensure that every time the brothers and sisters come to the meeting, they enjoy fellowship with the Lord and are supplied with life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, we must encourage the brothers and sisters to attend the prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the prayer meetings we can spend half an hour to fellowship about the spiritual principles of serving, how to follow the Lord s leading, how to serve people, or how to take care of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There will then be three meetings every week in which we read messages home meetings, bread-breaking meetings, and prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In one year we will read more than one hundred fifty messages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way we will have nourishing and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must not emphasize the big meetings any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the contrary, we must emphasize the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the function of the home meetings will be manifested, and people will be successfully brought to salvation, cared for, and supported.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, on the Lord s Day morning we should go over Truth Lessons in separate classes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The classes can be divided according to the level of the spiritual education of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way, every person in this large family will be healthy and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>DEVELOPING THE FUNCTION OF THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Preaching the gospel in the home meetings is very powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are more than four hundred home meetings in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If each home meeting brings one person to salvation every week, one thousand six hundred people will be saved in one month, and approximately twenty thousand will be saved in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since those saved in the home meetings are the relatives, friends, neighbors, or classmates of the brothers and sisters, they will be stable, and it will be easy for them to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have information cards for more than eleven thousand people, but only about four thousand people meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to visit and take care of the remaining six or seven thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can assign them to the saints based on where they live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The saints can then invite them for a meal, fellowship with them, and bring them to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot rely merely on the elders to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should rely on the home meetings to carry this out if we want to be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For the future of the church and for our spiritual growth and function before the Lord, we need to receive this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord returns, we will settle accounts with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot treasure only John 3:16, which says, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must also remember Matthew 25:19, which says, After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Lord returns, the good and faithful slaves will be rewarded, but the evil and slothful slaves will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if the Lord tarries, who among us dares to say that he will still be alive tomorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before we go to see the Lord, we must seize the opportunity to love Him, serve Him, please Him, and be ready to settle accounts with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>EVERYONE LEARNING TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A TEACHER OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Truth Lessons is according to the Lord s move among us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, we must attend the home meetings, and we must receive the education from Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to use Truth Lessons, we must first produce teachers of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not think that it is so difficult to be a teacher of the truth and that only a few people can be teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everyone can be a teacher of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, an elderly brother, who has been exercising in the church for many years, can teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He can read the title and outline of a lesson and then ask everyone to read the title and outline.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Anyone can lead a class by reading in this way and by having everyone ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is like teaching mathematics in elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A person simply needs to clearly state that one plus one equals two, write the equation on the blackboard, and ask the students to copy the equation and repeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After reading the outline, the teacher should give an overview of the lesson and the saints should read the lesson together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each lesson has more than seven pages, and it takes about five minutes to read each page.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is unwise for a teacher to speak too much or use his own words and expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The teachers do not need to add anything, because there are sufficient nutrients in the teaching material.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The best way to teach Truth Lessons is to lead the saints to read the text and to speak according to the text.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should speak and read the truth that is written in the text and not use our own words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is more supplying for the saints to read in this way than to listen to the speech of a famous person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May we enter into this practice.</S>
