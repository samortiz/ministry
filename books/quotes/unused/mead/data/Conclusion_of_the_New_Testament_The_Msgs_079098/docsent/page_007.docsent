   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>N. THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The writings of John reveal that the Spirit is the Spirit of reality John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit is the realization of what God the Father and God the Son are.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God the Father is light, and God the Son is life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reality of this light and life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have the light of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have God the Son as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reality of all the divine attributes of both God the Father and God the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 14:17; 15:26; and 16:13 the Lord Jesus speaks of the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First John 4:6 also uses this title of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, 1 John 5:6 says that the Spirit is the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Spirit of reality, the Spirit is the reality of God and of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is the reality of every divine thing, and, as such, He is the reality of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, because the Spirit is the reality, He is God, the Son, and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apart from the Spirit of reality, eternal life would be empty, vain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the Spirit is the reality of God, the Son, eternal life, grace, and every divine matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the Spirit is the reality of all divine and spiritual entities and items, He is called the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>O. THE COMFORTER PARACLETE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 14:16 reveals that the Spirit is the Comforter the Paraclete : "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Greek word rendered "Comforter" here is parakletos.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paraclete is the anglicized form of this Greek word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Greek parakletos denotes someone alongside who takes care of our cause, our affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is composed of two words: a preposition that means with and a form of the word for call.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In ancient times a paraclete was a helper, an advocate, a counsel, an intercessor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A paraclete was someone who served a particular person by taking care of his needs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As one who is always present, a paraclete may be considered a waiter, a helper, and even an attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a note on John 14:16 Darby says that a paraclete was "one who carries on the cause of any one and helps him."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In his translation of 1 John 2:1, where the same Greek word is used, Darby says that we have a patron with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then in a note he explains that he uses the word patron in the sense of the Roman patron, one who maintained the interests of his clients in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may say that the Spirit today is our Patron.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is with us to take care of our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Paraclete, the Comforter, signifies one called to another's side to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the Paraclete is a helper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit as the Paraclete is always available to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, the Paraclete is an Advocate and a Counsel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is also the One who consoles us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, He is the Consoler, the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the consummation of the Triune God, the Spirit as the Comforter, the Paraclete, is our helper, patron, counselor, and comforter who takes care of our needs in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>P. THE SPIRIT OF POWER</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit is not only the Spirit of life but also the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Inwardly we have the Spirit of life essentially, and outwardly we have the Spirit of power economically.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus says, "Behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The promise here is the promise of Joel 2:28 and 29, fulfilled on the day of Pentecost Acts 1:4-5, 8; 2:1-4, 16-18 , for the outpouring as the power from on high for the believers' ministry economically.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is different from the Spirit of life, who was breathed into the disciples by the resurrected Christ for His indwelling so that He might be life to them essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Acts 1:8 the Lord told the disciples that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit had come upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually the Spirit as "a rushing violent wind" came as power upon the disciples for their work Acts 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whereas we breathe in the Spirit of life, we need to put on the Spirit of power as a uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to be clothed with power we need the Spirit as a uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was the reason the Lord Jesus told the disciples that they would be clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Spirit of life and the Spirit of power are two aspects of the one Spirit for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We see both aspects in 1 Corinthians 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, we have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body; on the other hand, we have been given to drink of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be immersed in water is outward, but to drink water is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, drinking the Spirit inwardly is essential, and being baptized in the Spirit outwardly is economical.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The inward aspect of the Spirit is for life essentially, and the outward aspect is for ministry and work economically.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The outward aspect is related to the Spirit as the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just as the Spirit of life is the reality of life, so the Spirit of power is the reality of power.</S>
