   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we live the church life in a locality, we will be saved from self-views and self-goals.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Views are opinions and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Goals are purposes; they come from motives.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where there is a motive, there is a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only the church life can save us from our own opinions, motives, and goals.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, we who are in the church life should be those without any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is to be any opinion, it should be the opinion described in Romans 12:2: "Prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's perfect will is our view, opinion, and concept.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Other than this, we have no concept or motive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also have only one goal, which is to see that the Body of Christ be built up and the economy of God fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church life is our test.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It exposes all of our hearts, concepts, and motives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING THE CHURCH OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Body of Christ is unique in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the whole universe there is only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church of God is also unique in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This unique church of God in the universe becomes the churches in the various cities locally in all five continents through the spread of His children over all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every believer can only live in the practical church life in one local church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If anyone is not happy with the church where he is, he may move to meet in another church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After a while, he may move to yet another place to find a church that will satisfy him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of moving is not according to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God wants the believers to live the church life locally, practically, and without any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE PRACTICAL LOCAL CHURCHES IN THE BOOK OF ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The subject of Romans 16 is the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 1 talks about the just having life and living by faith v. 17 . Chapter five talks about the believers' justification unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Though chapter sixteen seems to only contain many verses which are just greetings, the focus of this chapter is not the greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This chapter shows us through the greetings the condition of the local churches at the time of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The greetings manifest the condition of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, in the church in Cenchrea, there was a sister named Phoebe who was a deaconess in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She had been a patroness of many and of the apostle vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She was indeed worthy of being a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul hoped that the church in Rome would receive her as a noble saint and in a manner worthy of her noble status.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, the churches of the nations existed severally in various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were not all in one locality v. 4 . Third, the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila was the church in Rome 16:3, 5a . This shows us that the number of saints in the church in Rome was probably not that large.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fourth, the churches of Christ were the local churches existing severally in various localities 16:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fifth, the church of which Gaius was the host probably refers to the church in Corinth, which met in Gaius' house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All these items show us the condition of the local churches at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE GATHERING POINT OF GOD'S SALVATION IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The local churches are the gathering point of our enjoyment of God's salvation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After a man is saved, he will always try to find a church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no saved person who does not want to find a church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a wonderful thing!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, the church is the gathering point where saints receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the gathering point of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you want to see God's grace, you have to go to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, this is the destination of our enjoyment of God's salvation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more we enjoy God's salvation in life, the more we love to go to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the place where we enjoy God's salvation in life unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Finally, the result of the enjoyment of God's life is our being saved from self-view and self-goal.</S>
