   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INDIVIDUAL TYPES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will first look at God's economy in the types of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we read the Old Testament carefully, we will see that it is roughly divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first section is a history of nine persons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second section is a history of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the history of the nine persons and the history of the nation of Israel are types and pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They both describe the same thing God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will first consider the first section of the Old Testament which is the story of nine persons recorded in the fifty chapters of the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first five persons of these nine form one group Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, and Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last four form another group Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first group shows us how God works Himself into the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The last group shows us how this man into whom God has worked Himself experiences Him as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the end the sinner becomes Israel, who is the prince of God, ruling for God and dispensing His riches into men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ADAM AND EVE CHRIST AND THE CHURCH Adam Christ as the Expression of God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among these nine persons, the first is Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Adam is a type in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After his creation and before his fall, he was a type of Christ who is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adam was created by God according to His own image for the purpose of expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God also entrusted him with the authority to rule over all things to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence the created Adam is a type of Christ expressing God and ruling for God as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eve the Church as the Expression of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God took a rib from Adam to form a woman Gen 2:22 who is Eve, his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eve is a type of the church as the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As Eve was from Adam, so the church is from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This picture shows us the desire of God in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is the unique Male in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He needs a counterpart Gen 2:18 which is the created man, redeemed and regenerated by Christ, transformed, and built together to become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why at the end of the Bible we see the Spirit and the bride speaking as one man in Revelation 22:17.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has a bride which means that He is married to the created, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This matter was mentioned by John the Baptist in John 3: "He who has the bride is the bridegroom" v. 29 . The Bridegroom is the Lord Jesus, and the bride is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 5 also says that as Adam and Eve were made husband and wife, so Christ and the church are made one body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>30-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we come to Revelation 19, we see that the marriage of the Lamb is come v. 7 . Chapter twenty-one says that the holy city, New Jerusalem, comes down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband v. 2 . The New Jerusalem is on the one hand the dwelling place of God, and on the other hand the bride of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lamb is the embodiment of the Triune God, and the Lamb's bride is a composition of the redeemed ones throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In eternity future the Triune God will become one body with His redeemed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The two will become one universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the goal of God's economy.</S>
