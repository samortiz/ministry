   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Training on the Study of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We want to implement the following in the training for the study of the Bible: We will ask ten brothers to help the saints study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This does not mean that these ten are experts on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are merely guides to lead the others into the right path.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If anyone wants to dig deeper, they have to spend more time to study by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We will first study Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can use such commentaries as those by Moule, Darby, F. G. Grant, and F. L. Godet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can also use Conybeare's paraphrase translation and writings by Kelly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should also spend time to study the Interlinear Greek New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These ten brothers should first study carefully at home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They can read through Romans in half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first time I studied Romans, I spent fifty-seven hours on it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may think that it is a waste of time to read through the whole book of Romans in one sitting, but I can only say that there are more words in a day's newspaper than in the entire book of Romans, yet many people can read through a newspaper in one sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we should not complain about finishing Romans in one sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we come together, the first thing we should do is study the meaning of the words in the text.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One of the ten should be designated to study the English translations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The best version to use is the Revised Version.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not use the King James Version.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Next consult the Interlinear Greek New Testament and study the text word by word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can also study the writings of Philip Schaff, the Greek concordance of Alfred Schmoller, and the Englishman's Greek Concordance of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will help us to rightly divide the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Never base a message on a word or expression which Paul did not use in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do, we will twist the word as Peter said and bring destruction upon ourselves 2 Pet 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The best English reference is Dean Alford's Greek New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a branch of research called "low criticism," which is somewhat similar to the textual research on Chinese classics that was prevalent during the Ming and Ching Dynasties.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This method takes every word of the Bible and analyzes it carefully according to the text.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The best work in this field was done by Alford.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His writing can be considered the representative in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have all these tools with us, we are quite complete as far as reference material is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the course of our study, we should spend much time discussing and fellowshipping among ourselves before making the appropriate judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not think that we can make proper judgments as long as we understand the original language and the meanings of the words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Proper judgment depends on the amount of light and revelation we receive from God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this respect we must all humble ourselves and learn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Like Paul, we should say that we have not yet come to know as we ought to know 1 Cor 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In my early days in Foochow, I studied the Bible every morning with over forty young brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We spent three and a half hours each day but sometimes covered only two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Three or four were seminary students.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After this kind of study, they began to know what the Bible is all about, and they readily admitted that they still had a long way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we are asking ten brothers to lead others to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These ten will have to spend more time to study and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They can neither be ignorant nor proud.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They should not think that they only need direct fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our head and feet do not have direct communication with each other; they communicate through the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are a foot, we should not try to link up with the head directly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead we should learn to be restricted and learn to accept others' judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some of us may not need to read one reference book at all, while another may concentrate on just one reference book.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to fellowship no matter what we do, and we have to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul said that we should not despise prophecies 1 Thes 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that we have to respect the revelations that others have received.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to honor the light that others have obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Need for Training to Meet the Need</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the beginning I have said that the ones who migrate have to be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is more serious than fighting a warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It would be terrible if we gave them a reed instead of arms for battle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can only meet the need by going through strict training and by being equipped with the proper provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The leading brothers must exercise vigilance over the whole flock.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must equip them with the best supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must study the Bible seriously according to the above method.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to dig into a few reference books before we can understand what studying the Bible really means and before we can train the other brothers and sisters to study in the same way.</S>
