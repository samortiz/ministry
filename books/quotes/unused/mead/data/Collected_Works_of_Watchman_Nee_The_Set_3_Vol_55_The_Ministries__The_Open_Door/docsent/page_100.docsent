   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S REVELATION BEING PROGRESSIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In reading the Bible, we find that God's revelation is always progressive and advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we only pay attention to ultimate absolutes when reading the Bible and fail to see that revelation is progressive, we will not be able to keep up with God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's revelation is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The offerings in Genesis were less profound than the offerings in Exodus, while the offerings in Leviticus were deeper than those in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is one example of progression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the revelation in the Bible is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we put all the advancing stages together, we have a complete picture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The absolutes in the Bible are the sum totals of the individual advancements.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Excerpt</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>NEWS The Boundaries Measured Out by the Lord Kansu Province</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our hearts are really full of joy to see that in these days God has gained people everywhere to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such speaking is like the flowing of a river.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We only hope that He will be able to get through in Lingxia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We hope He would not just be in us through His indwelling, but that He would come in and go out among us, freely flowing out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The message "Seizing the Opportunity" brought forth a deep responding "Amen" from our hearts!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we look back, we are filled with a sense of repentance!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God was not short in granting us the grace, but we were ignorant of the times He was caring for us!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were too reserved in the past because we wanted to protect ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, we damaged the future of the church of God!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we can only weep and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has recently shown us that the only way to attain wealth is to borrow empty vessels from the neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He says, "Borrow...and not just a few" 2 Kings 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we say there are no empty vessels, the oil stops!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, please send us a few extra copies of all your publications, perhaps twenty, but at least fifteen, because the number of people in our meetings has increased from ten to twenty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, most of us came from denominations, and we especially need nurturing and training in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are also one or two brothers and sisters in other places who need to receive these supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Please remember us in your prayers and in your move of gospel migrations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We would like to remind you that we are a gateway to the gospel work among Tibetans and Moslems.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord measured this area to you long ago, so you would not be overstepping your bounds to come here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please include us in your prayers that God would have much mercy on us!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A little member in the Lord,</S>
