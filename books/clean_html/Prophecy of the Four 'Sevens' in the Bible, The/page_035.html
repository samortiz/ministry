The Weight of Every Hailstone Being a Talent,<br>and Men Blaspheming God<br>Because the Plague Was Exceedingly Great</H2><P>Revelation 16:21 says that great hail comes down out of heaven upon men. The weight of every hailstone is a talent, about one hundred pounds, and men blaspheme God because the plague is exceedingly great. In the midst of the downpour of this great hail, those in the empire of Antichrist will continue to blaspheme God. This proves that they have no intention to repent. Rather, they will fight against God to the end.</P>
