At the end of this age, the people on earth will be in three categories: the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles. The word but at the beginning of verse 31 indicates that what is spoken from verse 31 to verse 46 is another section, the section concerning the Gentiles.</p><p>[Christ on the throne of glory is revealed in verse 31.] The Son of Man is the title of Christ in relation to His kingdom, the Messianic kingdom (13:41). His judgment here is a preparation for that kingdom. [Moreover], the coming spoken of in this verse is the open aspect of the Lord&#8217;s coming. It will be the continuation of His coming mentioned in 24:30. His glory comprises the glory of His divinity (John 17:22-24), the glory of His humanity (Psa. 45:3), the glory of His resurrection (John 7:39; Acts 3:13-15), and the glory of His ascension (Heb. 2:9). The throne on which He will sit is the throne of David (Luke 1:32-33), which will be in Jerusalem (Matt. 19:28; Jer. 3:17).</p><p>All the nations [in verse 32] refers to all the Gentiles who remain at Christ&#8217;s coming back to the earth, after He has destroyed those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21). These remaining Gentiles will all be gathered and judged at Christ&#8217;s throne of glory. This will be Christ&#8217;s judgment of the living before the millennium (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). It differs from His judgment of the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15) and will be executed on the earth after His judgment of the believers at His judgment seat in the air (vv. 19-30).</p><p>Verses 32 and 33...[indicate] that the Lord is the Shepherd not only of the believers (John 10:11; Heb. 13:20) and the Jews (Psa. 80:1; Jer. 31:10) but also of all the Gentiles (Psa. 100:1-3). The sheep will be gathered to His right hand, the place of honor (1 Kings 2:19; Psa. 45:9).</p><p>After the judgment at Christ&#8217;s throne of glory [in verse 34], the sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people living under the kingly ruling of Christ and the overcoming believers (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6) and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (Zech. 8:20-23). In this way the sheep will inherit the (coming) kingdom. In the millennium there will be three sections: (1) the earth, where the blessing of God&#8217;s creation will be, as mentioned in Genesis 1:28-30; (2) the nation of Israel in Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, from which the saved Jews will rule over the whole earth (Isa. 60:10-12; Zech. 14:16-18); and (3) the heavenly and spiritual section (1 Cor. 15:50-52), the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward (Matt. 5:20; 7:21). The kingdom that the sheep will inherit consists of the first section.</p><p>The blessing of the first section in the millennium, the blessing of God&#8217;s creation, was prepared for the sheep from the foundation of the world [Matt. 25:34], whereas the blessing in the third section, the blessing of the heavenly and spiritual kingdom, was ordained for the believers before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3-4).
