   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A BELIEVER'S WORTH BEFORE GOD A Message Given in Shanghai on December 8, 1930</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Issue No. 12 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:11-16; Lev 27:1-8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every time the life of a person is remembered before God, he will suffer a plague if he does not have a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying...then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them" Exo 30:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When David sent Joab to number Israel, God was displeased and sent pestilence upon Israel 1 Chron 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A man without the blood will be judged right away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now, we shall first outline the main points of the two passages recorded in Exodus 30 and Leviticus 27; then we will point out the meaning of these two passages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Exodus records:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 "This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary...a half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord" v. 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3 "Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the Lord" v. 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>4 "The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than half a shekel" v. 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Leviticus records:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1 "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When a man makes a special vow to Jehovah involving the valuation of persons" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2 "Then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And if it is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And if the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation of the male shall be five shekels of silver, and for the female the valuation shall be three shekels of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the person is from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, the valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3 "But if he is poorer than the valuation, then he shall be presented before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him who vowed, the priest shall value him" v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can see a big difference in these two passages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the book of Exodus, whoever is numbered, whether male or female, rich or poor, must offer half a shekel and half a shekel only as long as he is twenty years old and above.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But it is different in Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There the offering differs according to sex and according to whether one is rich or poor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why is there such a difference?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is because Exodus speaks of the worth of the ransom of life, and Leviticus speaks of the valuation of the special vow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE WORTH OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since Exodus speaks of the worth of the ransom of life, half a shekel is required of a person who is twenty years of age and older, whether male or female because this is a matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This half shekel is required of every man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If anyone fails to offer it, he will suffer a plague.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every person must have the Son of God in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As to the position of the salvation of sinners, we all have the same worth before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Half a shekel" is equivalent to the two denarii mentioned in Luke 10:35.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These two denarii have been paid by the Lord Jesus for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These two denarii are sufficient for us to live in the inn temporal life in the world until the second coming of our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Twenty years old" is the age when a person is able to take responsibility for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The teaching here is that whoever is responsible for himself must have the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For the Israelites, responsibility was determined on the basis of their physical age, but for us in the dispensation of the grace of salvation, no one knows when a person can be responsible for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is possible that some people have reached this age of responsibility at seven or eight years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because the precious blood is the price, there is no difference between the poor and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Poverty and riches can be compared to the deeds of men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who do not have good deeds cannot save themselves; likewise, those who have good deeds cannot save themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They all have to offer half a shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man cannot add anything to or deduct anything from the salvation accomplished by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man can only be saved by the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This blood is called the precious blood because it is indeed "precious," and is full of worth 1 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The precious blood is a high price!</S>
