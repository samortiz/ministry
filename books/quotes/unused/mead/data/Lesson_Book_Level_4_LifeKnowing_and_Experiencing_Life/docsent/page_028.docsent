   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we first consecrate ourselves, our experience is similar to an embryo in the mother's womb one cannot distinguish the ear, the eye, the mouth, and the nose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we grow in life, however, these five points related to the experience of consecration gradually become formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then we really have a feeling that we have been bought by God and that all our rights are in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We become a prisoner of His love because His love has pierced our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We become a sacrifice indeed, laid on the altar for God's enjoyment and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will be those who have been thoroughly worked over by God and are then able to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our future will truly be as a handful of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All our ways of escape outside of God's will shall have been cut off; God only will be our future and our way.</S>
