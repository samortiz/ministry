   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Seventeen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 17: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the Lord Jesus is again calling those who have spiritual ears to learn the lesson taught by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knows except he who receives it."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should pay special attention to the Lord's promise to the overcomers in Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the condition in Pergamos is not merely an ancient event but the current condition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only are the teachings and warnings of this letter related to us, even its promises directly affect us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, it should affect us more today than in those days because we are living in the age when the sinful teachings of those days are ripening, maturing, and increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the condition of the church as revealed in this letter is most corrupt and gloomy, the promise it contains is full of life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When circumstances are particularly trying, the overcomers will have particular rewards.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the preordained course, if we want to gain our possession, we must pass through sufferings, trials, and battles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord's word here is for the comfort and encouragement of those who are still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the distant view unfolded in these words seems to take one beyond the battlefield into the possession of one's hope already!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This promise is divided into two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First is the manna, which typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It shows how the believers long after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second is the white stone, which typifies the Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It shows how the Lord longs after the Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This exchange of love is most touching!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All those who trust in the Lord, who honor His name and would not deny this name, will be rewarded according to their faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before we go on to the spiritual significance, we first have to mention one important point.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to realize that this promise was meant to be literal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although there are spiritual meanings to the Lord's promises, we should not consider the spiritual significance first and ignore the literal facts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the interpretation of God's word, we should know that other than the parables, the prophetic symbols, and the signs, everything should be expounded literally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, this does not mean that we should annul all spiritual meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not annul the literal meanings by the spiritual meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One should first expound literally, then spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this, the word of God will be made rich.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As to the first half of this promise, we know that there were people who had eaten manna before.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, it is not impossible for man to eat manna again in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the future, we will have a resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will be like the Lord Jesus, being able to eat and drink as before.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The manna was the people's food in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet the hidden manna promised by the Lord is not for every believer but for the overcoming ones among all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us consider the second half of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the white stone?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We know that the manna and the white stone are both objects taken from the Aaronic priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As Pharaoh of old gave Joseph a new name and a ring, in the same way Christ will give to His overcomers a new name and a white stone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This name is now kept secret.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only the overcomers will know the secret of this heavenly name, and only the overcomers will inherit this name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the name of Antipas was unknown to man, in the same way, the name of the overcomers will be unknown to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We believe that in the future there will be literal manna to feed our resurrected bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also believe that in the future we will receive an actual precious white stone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the literal side of these words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, besides the literal meanings, there are still many profound spiritual meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we want to consider the spiritual side of these words.</S>
