   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Putting On the Outward Christ 1:14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 14 says, "My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Camphire is henna, and it is used for fingernail dye.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jewish women carried camphire wherever they went.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Engedi is the name of a place in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The meaning of Engedi is "the fountain of the lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the place to which David fled, and it is a wilderness Josh 15:61-62; 1 Sam 23:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word "vineyards" should be translated "the place of the grapes."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One cannot see the vine flower in the place of the grapes; no flower is found in the place of the grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This place of the grapes is in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a flower appears in this place, it will be very conspicuous.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 14 covers a wider area than verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The henna flower appearing in the place of the grapes speaks of Christ's distinctiveness being manifested and accentuated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Myrrh is between the breasts and cannot be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, it refers to the inward Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse Christ is the outward adornment, and the maiden has put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that Christ is confessed and testified outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before men Christ is the henna flower; He is now being manifested through the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE KING'S PRAISE 1:15</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 15 says, "Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This praise is for the purpose of encouraging her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first "thou art fair" encourages her, whereas the second "thou art fair" praises her eyes as being doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The eyes of a dove, in their literal sense, are a description of the beauty of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Spiritually speaking, this means having spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As far as their function is concerned, doves' eyes can only see one thing at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, functionally speaking, this means purity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The maiden has received revelation; she has obtained spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She has also put the myrrh between her breasts, and she has a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the King can now praise her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE MAIDEN'S RESPONSE 1:16 2:1</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 16 says, "Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is not only fair, but pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is her response to the King.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Also our bed is green."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The maiden has attained the rest which she had previously sought.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is feeding as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The grass is the bed, and the reclining is the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This matches Psalm 23:2, which says, "He makes me lie down in green pastures;/He leads me to waters of rest."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The table which was mentioned previously also has the element of rest, but the emphasis there was on eating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here the bed has an element of eating, but the emphasis is on rest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a shepherd is not skillful, his sheep will not stop eating when they are put in a green pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if the shepherd is skillful, his sheep will be able to lie down even though they are in the green pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will have satisfaction and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 17 says, "The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fir is cypress.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The cedar is a tall and strong tree.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Bible, it refers to a humanity that is filled with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many things in the Bible are made of cedar.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many things are made of cypress.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Cypress is produced in a place called "death city."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Jews planted cypress beside their graves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, cypress signifies the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Under such a condition, the maiden is at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Grass signifies everything that is living, that has life, and that can serve as food.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can only rest when we lie on top of this grass.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our shelter is the Lord's glorious humanity and His death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Solomon's temple, there were two chief kinds of wood cedar and cypress.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In other words, only these two kinds of wood are qualified to be material for God's habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God dwells among the cedar and the cypress.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can now rest in God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 2:1 says, "I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This verse comes immediately after 1:17.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This word is not spoken by the King, but by the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If this word were spoken by the King, it would be hard to interpret.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If this were the King's word, it would not make sense for him to say in the next verse that the maiden is a lily.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Sharon" is a plain, and the "rose" can be considered as a kind of wild lily or wild rose.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This flower is considered a despicable plant in the land of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The lily of the valleys is ordinary and unassuming.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is "the lily of the valleys," and not "the lily of the pot."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is not cared for by man, but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The maiden acknowledges that she is a rose of Sharon and a lily of the valleys because the King praises her in 1:15.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On the one hand, in 1:16-17 she praises the King, and on the other hand, she mentions rest.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She mentions herself as merely being a rose of the wilderness and a lily of the valleys.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This means that she is not worth anything in herself and that she is but an ordinary person cared for by God.</S>
