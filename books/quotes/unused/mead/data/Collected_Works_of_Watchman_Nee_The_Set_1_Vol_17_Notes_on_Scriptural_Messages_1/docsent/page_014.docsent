   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LUKE 14:25-35</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 25: "And there were great crowds going along with Him, and He turned and said to them..."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why was there a great crowd with Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is because He had just preached the gospel by means of a parable vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>16-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And just like the parable, many were invited, and whoever would eat came.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The "many" are the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a joy to be saved, and it is wonderful to continue in the enjoyment of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But to the very people who were with Him, the Lord turned and had a further word for them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He meant, "Yes, you are saved, but to follow Me there is a condition."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord raised the standard of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even such a great crowd was not enough reason for Him to lower the standard that God had prescribed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, though the truths concerning the kingdom and the kingship be high, neither should we refrain from speaking them on account of men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The gate which opens to salvation through faith in Jesus is wide, but the gate which opens to following the Lord and being glorified with Him is narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" John 6:37b .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, to follow the Lord and be His disciple, there are certain conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 26: "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord brought up the matter of the soul-life again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First He mentioned the father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Finally, He mentioned the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If only man would not value his soul-life, all would be well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should lay aside anything that brings our soul delight and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord did not say that you should cast out your father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters; rather, He said to do away with your natural life, that is, to channel all the love you have for these things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is absolutely necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When anyone follows Him, He specifically sets this huge obstacle in front of them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they are able to go through it, they can go through anything in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord does not wait for them to come through the gate before placing the obstacle before them; He makes it difficult right from the start.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are qualified to be His disciples only if they get through.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the Lord has saved a person, He lays down this condition at the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He does not give one the condition after he has become a Christian for three or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether or not one can be His disciple is determined from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 27: "Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse explains the foregoing verses, which are on the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Following this, the Lord speaks of three parables, which explain the matter of the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A. The Parable of Building a Tower vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>28-30</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 28: "For which of you, wanting to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord spoke of "calculating the cost," do we not take it to mean that we should just forget about the building of this tower if we do not have the money?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If that is the case, does it mean that He has not called many to follow Him?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they do not have sufficient funds, does it mean that they should give up building the tower?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No, they should not give up, for if everyone were to put in every single penny he has, it would definitely be sufficient, and no one would dare to say that he does not have enough.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What the Lord was saying was that when a man wants to build a tower, it is a question of whether or not he is willing to put in all his money for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, if five hundred dollars is required to build a tower, but the man is only willing to put in three hundred, keeping the remaining two hundred, one cannot say that his funds are inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is inadequate only because a portion of his money is kept for other use.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If one keeps back a portion of his love for others, he will not be able to love Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He must hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters and must turn his heart away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord does not ask how much you have given Him; He asks if you have given Him your all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verses 29-30: "Lest perhaps, once he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all those looking on will begin to mock him, saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the end of him who would not wholly love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He can only lay a foundation without building the tower because he is holding back something from the Lord.</S>
