   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SEVEN LAMPS SHINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The other aspect is that of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit of God today is the seven lamps, shining on us in an intensified way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many of us have experienced this intensified shining, far stronger than a simple prick of the conscience, condemning a wrong thought or wrong motive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What did not bother us in the past we can no longer do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we open our mouth to tell a joke, the seven Spirits shine and our sentence is cut off in midair.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we begin to make some critical comments about a certain sister, the seven Spirits shine and our words fail.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even when we are off just a little, the Spirit is there as the light shining.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These seven Spirits are also the seven eyes Rev 5:6 , watching and transfusing you with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we look at others, we infuse what is in us into them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the seven Spirits shine, the seven eyes transmit God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is by this means that the element of God in us is increased.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are men of clay, but day by day the gold in us increases.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This gold is living and flowing, as we can see from Zechariah 4:12, where we are told that the two golden pipes empty the gold oil is not in the original out of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gold is not a solid mass, but in a liquid state so that it can flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is this gold which is flowing out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Formerly what flowed out of us was the bitter water of gossip, criticism, and foolish talking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now out of us flows gold!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The clay is decreasing, as we are more and more transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the gold in you to increase you must learn to walk according to spirit Gal 5:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Again and again during the day you must turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace" Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a problem arises with your spouse, or if a brother complains that your work is not satisfactory, do not reply in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A quick answer will open the door to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of replying, pray!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Set your mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then the words that come forth from your mouth will come from the spirit rather than from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord will be your wisdom, and gold will flow out instead of bitter water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will sense from the Spirit of the Lord what you should say; in your speaking, He will be speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our greatest problem, as those whose spirits have been quickened, is that we do not live according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We live according to our mind, or our knowledge, or what the Bible teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To live according to spirit, we must pray without ceasing 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All day long we must maintain a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In every situation which arises, we should pause before answering or reacting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we take a moment to renew our touch with the Lord, then we have the opportunity to respond to the situation in spirit instead of in our natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ephesians 6:18 reminds us of the importance of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to have "all prayer praying at every time in spirit watching in all perseverance."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the way to preserve ourselves in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we thus become one spirit with the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 , He will become our living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We shall become men of gold, and the whole church will be a golden lampstand, expressing the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We shall live and walk by the Spirit Gal 5:25 and have our mind set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By the mingling of these two spirits, we can be watchful to keep ourselves in the spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then what we live out will be "no longer I but Christ" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To us to live will be Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the normal way for us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is by this means that the church will become a golden lampstand.</S>
