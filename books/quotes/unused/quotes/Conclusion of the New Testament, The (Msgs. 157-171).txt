With this message we shall begin to consider the believers' experiencing the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately
We may pay attention to God's salvation but not to the kingdom, regarding the kingdom as something strictly in the future
According to the New Testament, repentance and regeneration are mainly for us to enter into the kingdom of God
At the beginning of His ministry, the Lord Jesus also charged people to repent because the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near
To Nicodemus the Lord Jesus said, 'Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
If we believe in the Lord, we shall be born again, and by being born again we shall enter into the kingdom of God
The New Testament indicates that repentance and regeneration through believing in the Lord are not first for salvation but for the kingdom
In Revelation 1:9 John says, 'I John, your brother and joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus'
We see that John and the other believers were in the kingdom already for the exercise in tribulation and endurance
In verse 5 He goes on to say, 'Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
Because through regeneration we receive the divine life, the life of God, regeneration is the entrance into the kingdom
To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to the entrance into God's eternal glory, to which He has called us in Christ
These are the substance of our faith's substantiation allotted to us by God as our portion for our inheritance
Life is the inward energy, the inward strength, to bring forth the outward godliness, which leads to glory and results in glory
God's purpose in giving us the precious and exceedingly great promises is that we may become partakers of the divine nature
As believers in Christ, we have the position, the ability, and the provision to become partakers of the divine nature
As we enjoy God's nature, a part of this nature becomes our holiness, and other parts become our humility, love, kindness, and other virtues
Peter 1:5 says, 'And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue, and in virtue knowledge'
Literally, the Greek word for virtue means excellency; it denotes the energy of the divine life issuing in vigorous action
The virtue in verse 5 refers to that mentioned in verse 3, where Peter speaks of the One who has 'called us to His own glory and virtue'
When we partake of the divine nature, the different aspects of the riches of what God is, these riches become our virtues
The response to, or the reflection of, Christ as the embodiment of God to be our inheritance within us is faith
In 1:6 Peter continues, 'And in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness'
As to ourselves, we must have self-control, and as to our circumstances, no matter what they may be, we need endurance
In order to live a proper Christian life, we need endurance toward those around us and also toward our environment and circumstances
The Greek word for love in verse 7 is agape, the word used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature
Such a love needs to be developed in brotherly love, to govern it and flow in it for the full expression of God, who is this love
It denotes the existence of certain things that belong to someone from the beginning and thus become his rightful possession to the present
Peter 1:9 and 10 say, 'He in whom these things are not present is blind, being shortsighted, having forgotten the cleansing of his past sins
Wherefore brothers be the more diligent to make your calling and selection firm for doing these things you shall by no means ever stumble
To be diligent is to develop the spiritual virtues in the divine life, to advance in the growth of the divine life
If we are diligent to develop the virtues mentioned in verses 5 through 7, we shall confirm, make sure, our calling and selection
If we develop these virtues and are constituted of them, we shall have the confirmation that we have been called and selected
As a result, we shall be full of Christ, and, in Paul's words, we shall arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
Now we need to see that, having entered into the kingdom of God, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
According to Matthew, there are three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation
The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward condition of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed in chapter thirteen
Let us briefly consider each of these sections in order to see the believers' living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
If we would live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we must live in the heavenly nature of the kingdom people
We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being so that we may realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens
If we mourn according to God and His economy, we shall be comforted by being rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens
In verse 6 the Lord says, 'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied'
We need to hunger and thirst for this righteousness, to seek after such a righteousness, that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens
If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, God will grant us to be satisfied with the very righteousness we seek
To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, whereas to be merciful is to give someone better than he deserves
To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory
Our spirit is the organ to receive Christ , whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows
Verse 10 says, 'Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
Matthew 5:10 says that those who are persecuted for righteousness are blessed, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens
In speaking of the believers' influence upon the world, the Lord Jesus tells us that we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world
Through its killing and preserving function, salt brings the earth back to its original condition or keeps it in its original condition
In the present age, wherever the believers are, they should exercise a salting influence over those around them
The darkness is not upon the earth; rather, it is in the world, which denotes human society, a system of Satan
The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house
Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens'
Outwardly as a city and inwardly as a lamp we shine to express God, to let God have glory in the eyes of others
The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life, the life of the Father, is the highest supply to meet this demand
As children of the heavenly Father, we need to live in the presence of the Father and care for the Father's presence
Mammon, standing in opposition to God, indicates that wealth or riches are the opponent of God, robbing God's people of their service to Him
As those living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we should not allow mammon to replace God in our living
In verse 33 the Lord Jesus says, 'Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you'
If we live in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, we shall always judge ourselves, not others
Matthew 7:3-5 says, 'Why do you look at the splinter in your brother's eye, but do not consider the log in your own eye?
Hypocrite, first remove the log from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother's eye'
In verse 13 destruction does not refer to the perdition of the person but to the destruction of his deeds and work
In verse 14 life refers to the ever blessed condition of the kingdom, which is filled with the eternal life of God
If we would live in the reality of the kingdom, we first need to enter such a narrow gate and then walk in such a constricted way
We should not only take the way which leads to life but also take the words of Christ as the ground for our living and work
Our living and work must be founded on the word of Christ for the accomplishment of the will of the heavenly Father
The rain is of God descending from the heavens the rivers are of man coming from the earth and the winds are of Satan blowing from the air
If we do not take Christ's words as the ground for our living and work, eventually all that we do will pass into destruction
On the one hand, the church is a family, a home, full of grace and life; on the other hand, the church is a kingdom, a government, to rule
In 14:17 Paul does not say that the kingdom of God shall be; he uses the present tense and says that the kingdom of God is
According to the context of Romans 14, which speaks of receiving the believers, the kingdom is today's church life
When the authority of God's kingdom is allowed to operate in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life
When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, and our peace toward others, and our joy with God
In the practical kingdom life in the church today, we must be strict with ourselves and make no excuses for ourselves
In Ephesians 4:3 we have the charge to be 'diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace'
If we live righteously toward ourselves and peacefully toward others, we shall live joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit
Revelation 1:9 says, 'I John, your brother and joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus'
In this life there is the divine nature, and with the divine nature there is a ruling, a governing, that is both divine and heavenly
Although Revelation 1:9 speaks of the kingdom, in the first few chapters of this book the lampstands, the churches, are revealed
For us to be in the kingdom today is not a matter of glory but a matter of bearing shame and suffering persecution
The kingdom of God is the church life, and the church life is a realm of the enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ
Eventually, if we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and partake in the kingdom, we shall inherit the kingdom of God
According to the Lord's word in Matthew, we must be absolutely righteous if we are to inherit the coming kingdom as a reward
In 1 Corinthians 6:9b and 10 Paul speaks of different kinds of persons who will not inherit the kingdom of God
According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord
To inherit the kingdom is not simply to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment
In Galatians 5:21 Paul, referring to the works of the flesh, says, 'Those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God'
The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers
Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5:19-21 will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and are, in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today
The millennium will be the kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today
Today all believers are in the kingdom of God, but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom
Shortly before Paul was martyred, he had the assurance that the Lord would bring him into the heavenly kingdom
It equals the crown of righteousness in 2 Timothy 4:8, and it is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly course
The teachings of the Lord Jesus and the apostles concerning the kingdom should warn us not to be careless or indifferent
Believers who are indifferent and unfaithful will not receive the same reward when the Lord Jesus comes back as the faithful ones
The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord's salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race
Such a reward will be awarded to the believers, not according to the grace of the Lord but according to His righteousness
Whereas salvation is prepared in His love and grace, the reward is prepared in His justice, in His righteousness
For this reason, the Lord cannot righteously give the same reward both to those who are faithful and to those who are unfaithful
We should not think that because salvation is eternal, we shall not have any problems with the Lord at His coming back
Those believers whose Christian works will not be approved by the judging Lord and who will suffer the loss of reward will still be saved
As those who are under the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity, we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today
In this message we shall begin to see that the believers experience this dispensing corporately also by living in the church
Through regeneration we have entered into the kingdom of God to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
We experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God and living in the kingdom
The Christian life has two aspects: the aspect of the individual Christian life and the aspect of the corporate Christian life
The gospel of the kingdom brings forth the church because the kingdom is the life itself, and the church is the issue of life
A believer who does not live in the reality of the kingdom can at best be a saved person he cannot be built into the structure of the church
In the first preaching of the New Testament gospel people were told to repent because the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near
The kingdom is the realm of life for life to move, work, rule, and govern so that life may accomplish its purpose
Of course, we cannot realize the kingdom life unless we receive God's salvation, a salvation that becomes the supply to us for our enjoyment
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the content of the church life
Because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, when Christ is expressed, the entire Triune God is expressed
In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus mentioned the church twice, both times in the Gospel of Matthew, a book that proclaims the kingdom
In Matthew 18:17 He speaks of the church in the local sense, indicating that the local church is also related to the kingdom of the heavens
If we would have the reality of the kingdom as the content of our church life, we need Christ to be our life and our life supply
By this life, which is Christ Himself, we live a life according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
It is crucial for us to see that we experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by living in the kingdom
The church is not something that can be organized by putting people together, forming them into an entity, and calling them a church
For the church to be the organic Body of Christ the church must be constituted of the Christ who is the life of the believers
Just as Eve had the same life and nature that Adam had, the church has the same life and nature that Christ has
Spontaneously this transmission, which is actually the divine dispensing, will issue in the living of the church life
In these messages on the conclusion of the New Testament, we have emphasized the dispensing of the processed Triune God again and again
As the spontaneous issue of this dispensing, we shall have the kingdom life, and this kingdom life will be our church life
The individual Christian life and the corporate church life both issue spontaneously from the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us
To experience and enjoy this dispensing of the processed Triune God is to live the reality of the kingdom in the church life
We experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God corporately by entering into the kingdom and also by living in the church
The Greek word rendered 'house' in 1 Timothy 3:15 may also be translated household, as in 1 Timothy 3:4,5, and 12
The Greek word for 'household' here refers both to the house, the dwelling place, and to the household, the family
Verse 19 mentions the household, while verse 22 says that we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit
In our meetings service and ministry we must give people the impression that the living God is living moving speaking and acting among us
Where the house of God is, there is the family of God, and where the family of God is, there is God the Father with His life and reality
Christ is not separate from the members of the Body, for, as the Head of the Body, Christ indwells all the members
A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church
God's New Testament economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
Timothy 3:15 and 16 indicate that the church is also God's manifestation in the flesh-the mystery of godliness
Timothy 3:15b and 16 say, 'The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
The transition from 'the mystery ' to 'who' implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness
These verses imply that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body is the manifestation of God in the flesh
The mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living is the manifestation of God in the flesh
It was not the universal church as revealed by the Lord in Matthew 1618 but only a part of the universal church which is the Body of Christ
The record of the New Testament concerning the establishment of the church in its locality is consistent throughout
If we have only the local aspect but not the aspect of the church being of God, we shall have only an outward formality
On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality
Except for a few Epistles written to individuals, all the Epistles in the New Testament were written to local churches
If a brother sins, we first need to deal with him in love , then by two or three witnesses , and finally through the church with authority
A Gentile or tax collector is someone who does not have the fellowship in the kingdom life or in the church life
Matthew 16 concerns the universal building of the church, but chapter eighteen concerns the local practice of the church
Both chapters indicate that the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having the authority to bind and to loose
According to the context of 18:17, both the reality and the practicality of the kingdom are in the local church
The more we realize how independent our natural self is, the more willing we shall be to submit to the church and to obey the church
If we do not submit to the church, we are through with the kingdom, for the kingdom life is a life of submission to the church
The church must be certain that it has the presence of the Lord as its reality; otherwise, it has no genuine authority
The church then has the ground to exercise authority in the presence of the Lord over such a case of rebellion
After speaking in verse 23 of the whole church, Paul in verse 28 mentions a case when a person should 'be silent in the church'
When the whole church comes together, that is the meeting, and that is also the church because the meeting is the church
If we meet in small groups in our homes, all those different meetings should be parts of the one church in our locality
In the first local church, the church at Jerusalem , there were elders taking care of the government of the church
The flock needs to be cared for, protected, led in the right direction, and brought to a place where they can eat and drink
The Greek word translated 'overseer' is episkopos, from epi meaning over and skopos meaning seer; hence, overseer
The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity, and overseer, denoting the function of an elder
Deacons and deaconesses are the serving ones in a local church under the direction of the overseers, the elders
The overseers take care of the church, and the deacons and deaconesses serve the church by taking care of many practical matters
The word of wisdom is spoken mainly by the prophets, and the word of knowledge is taught mainly by the teachers
In order to understand the service of the prophets and the teachers, we need to know the difference between prophesying and teaching
In the Bible as a whole and in the New Testament in particular, the word 'prophesy' does not mainly mean to predict
To prophesy in the sense of foretelling, of predicting something before it happens, is miraculous and does not require the growth in life
The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God's revelation and who sometimes speak with inspired prediction
Peter 4:10 says, 'Each one according as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God'
In the church we all should serve as good stewards of the varied grace of God, ministering this grace to one another
Every saint should have the equal right and opportunity to speak concerning Christ, to speak for Christ and to speak forth Christ
In 1 Corinthians 1426 one has a psalm another has a teaching another has a revelation another has a tongue and another has an interpretation
We must turn from the traditional practice of having only one or a few speakers and recover the Lord's ordained way of mutuality
Corinthians 14:26 indicates that when the whole church comes together in one place, we should practice mutuality
There is not a hint in the New Testament that in a church meeting there should be just one or two persons speaking
Paul does not say shall have or should have he speaks in the present tense to denote the fact and says that each one of us has something
He does not say that just a few have, that many have, or that most have; he says that 'each one has' something
He then mentions five things in the following sequence: a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation
The fact that Paul mentions a psalm first indicates that in the meetings of the church praising the Lord must be primary
After saying, 'Each one has a psalm,' Paul goes on to mention a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation
Such a revelation should be centered on Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ, not on other things
The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit
The New Testament makes it very clear that speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Spirit and not all the believers have it
The psalm should be the praise of God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life
The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ with the church as His Body to others
To exhibit Christ and to enjoy Him in our meetings for the building up of His Body must be our unique purpose and goal
Love is the excellent way to experience the divine life and make it the content of the gift of prophecy for the building up of the church
In 14:3 Paul goes on to say, 'He who prophesies speaks to men for building up and encouragement and consolation'
Because prophecy, in speaking forth the Lord, ministers Christ to others, it builds them up and gives them encouragement and consolation
In 1 Corinthians 14:12 Paul says, 'Since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the church'
The increase of the element of God means that more of God Himself is blended into us, is gained by us, and becomes our element
The more we love Christ, seek Christ, and allow Christ to live in us, the more the stature of Christ increases within us
The planting and watering are done by the apostles, but the growth is given only by God, who is the source of life
Acts 2:45 tells us that the believers sold their possessions and properties and divided them according to need
Paul refers to this in 2 Corinthians 815 saying As it is written He who gathered much had no excess and he who gathered little had no lack
By Christ as our victory in His overcoming life, we can overcome the usurping power of enticing and deceiving riches
In verse 9a Paul says, 'Let love be without hypocrisy,' and in 10a he continues, 'Love one another warmly in brotherly love'
What a great difference there is between this kind of love and the love that is simply a human attempt to imitate the love of God!
According to the New Testament the love the believers have for one another is actually a triangular love a love that involves three parties
The Lord replied, 'I do not say to you until seven times, but until seventy times seven' , and then He gave a parable as an illustration
Matthew 18:35 says, 'So also shall My heavenly Father do to you if you do not forgive each one his brother from your hearts'
If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, we shall be disciplined by the Lord until we forgive him from our heart
If we do not practice the way of repentance and forgiveness, the longer we stay in the church life, the more offenses there will be
When we take Him as our person and live by Him, forgiving others will be a spontaneous virtue of our Christian life
As the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by living in the church, they are built in the church
According to the context, the dwelling place of God in 2:22 is local, whereas the holy temple in the preceding verse is universal
In verse 22 Paul is saying that the local saints, the saints in Ephesus, were being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God
In 2:22 Paul is careful to point out that it is in Christ that the local saints are built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit
If we are willing to be built into the church in our locality, we shall have the abundance of the growth in life
In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, 'Since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the church'
In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord Jesus charges the saints to be overcomers
In 2:11b the Lord says to the church in Smyrna, 'He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death'
To overcome in the epistle to the church in Thyatira is to overcome Catholicism, to overcome the apostate Roman Catholic Church
As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the protestant church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ
To overcome in this epistle means to overcome the deadness of the protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism
Revelation 1:4 speaks of 'the seven Spirits who are before His throne,' and 3:1, of 'the seven Spirits of God'
The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God, because they are ranked among the Triune God in Revelation 1:4 and 5
As seven is the number of completion in Gods operation so the seven Spiritsthe sevenfold intensified Spiritmust be for Gods move on earth
In substance and existence God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation God's Spirit is sevenfold
At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned, from whom grace and peace are given to the receivers
The believers may be overcomers also through eating Christ as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast
To eat of the tree of life, that is, to enjoy Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life
The degradation of the church distracts God's people from the eating of Christ as their food to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge
If, as we read these epistles, we are open in our spirit to Him, the Spirit will immediately speak something of Christ into us
Once we hear His speaking, something indelible will be wrought into us, and nothing will be able to take it away
The man-child brought forth in verse 5 is composed of the brothers in verse 10 who have been opposed and accused by Satan, the enemy of God
They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their testimony, and by not loving their soul life even unto death
The ultimate consummation of our living in the church will be that we become the bride, the counterpart of Christ, at His coming back
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age
In order to experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately, the believers need to take three steps
If the kingdom, the church, and the Body of Christ were taken away from the New Testament, very little would be left
The kingdom, the church, and the Body of Christ are both the framework and the intrinsic elements of our Christian life
Finally, in 28:23 Paul 'expounded and solemnly testified the kingdom of God' to those who came to him in his lodging
The church will become the organism of Christ, the Body of Christ, expressing the Triune God in His embodiment in Christ
If we mean business in this age to follow the Lord Jesus for His interest on earth, we must enter into the kingdom of God
We need to have not only the truth, the doctrine, of the kingdom but also the reality and practicality of the kingdom
Some Christian teachers say that, in the New Testament, the Body of Christ is merely a parable illustrating how close we are to Christ
We may consider the vine in John 15 a parable, but we should not say that the church as the Body of Christ is a parable
Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ
We may talk a great deal about the baptism in the Spirit but not nearly as much about being baptized into the Body
Positively, we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ; negatively, we have been baptized into the death of Christ
The destination of such a baptism is not the Triune God, Christ, or the death of Christ; the destination is the Body of Christ
Today we are not only in the Triune God, in Christ, and in the death of Christ-we are in the Body of Christ, the church
The Body of Christ is our destination, and in the Body we should live, move, serve, worship, grow, act, work, and have our being
We should always live in this reality-whatever is outside of us is the Spirit, and whatever is inside of us is the Spirit
To be baptized in the one Body is to experience something once for all, but to drink one Spirit is a continuing experience
Many Christians have only the 'wedding'-baptism; they do not have the 'married life'-the daily drinking of one Spirit
Corinthians 1212 says Even as the body is one and has many members but all the members of the body being many are one body so also is Christ
The church can be the Body of Christ only as the members are constituted of Christ, possessing His life and nature
If we consider our physical body, we shall realize that anything that does not have our life and nature cannot be part of our body
Because the reality of Christ is the Spirit, the way to be constituted of Christ to be His Body is to drink the Spirit
The baptism into the one Body has positioned us all to drink, and by drinking of the Spirit we are constituted to be the Body
We need much transformation , from the natural life to the spiritual, by the Spirit for the practical Body life
In the proper church life there will always be the weaker members, the less honorable members, and the comely members
The Body is built up with all the different members: the comely ones, the less honorable ones, and the weaker ones
Without tempering, a quick person cannot go along with a slow one, and there cannot be any building between them
In our experience many times the tempering comes out of practical situations in working together in coordination
Balancing, adjusting, coordinating, tempering-all are related to the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God into our being
The phrase 'in Christ' always implies the thought or the fact that we are organically one with Christ, that we have a life union with Him
If we do not cooperate with each other, then we are detached members, and the Body life cannot be realized in a practical way
Because our being exists in the body, we must present the body so that our whole being may be given over to God in a practical way
Many believers have a heart to consecrate themselves, but because their physical body has not been offered, their consecration is useless
Now in Romans 12 the believers are encouraged to offer themselves as a sacrifice to God, as a living offering filled with the Spirit of life
Transformation does not merely denote a change; it means that a substance is changed both in nature and in form
Transformation is not outward correction or adjustment; transformation is an inward, metabolic change of our being
If our mind is saturated and occupied by the Lord, He will certainly take over our emotion and possess our will
The will of God does not refer to the matter of our personal human situation such as marriage, employment, and housing
If we would live the Body life in a practical way, our spirit must be burned and burning, on fire all the time
For the Body life we need a body that is presented, a mind that is renewed in the transformation of the soul, and a spirit that is burning
For the sake of the Body life our body needs to be presented our soul needs to be transformed and our mind needs to be metabolically changed
If we have a heart for the Body life but fail to present our body to the Lord for His Body, we are impractical
Suppose, by the Lord's mercy, our body has been presented and our mind has been renewed, but our spirit remains cold
Paul's word concerning the body, the soul, and the spirit in these chapters links chapter eight to chapter twelve
Rather, the teaching concerning the Body will merely be a doctrine to us, and our talk regarding the Body will be vain
The more we enjoy the dispensing of the Trinity into our tripartite being, the more we desire to be in the Body
The enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God makes us living members of the Body of Christ in a practical way
Grace is not outward; it is the element of the divine life which is wrought into our being and which gives us some skill or ability
The fact that the gifts in Romans 12 are according to grace means that these gifts are granted according to the measure of life
All the items included in 1268 are gifts of grace in life and include prophecy service teaching exhortation giving leading and showing mercy
The main idea of prophecy in Romans 12 is not prediction but speaking for God and speaking God forth under His direct inspiration
Based on the direct speaking under God's inspiration and the teaching according to this inspiration, certain ones in the Body may exhort
We need many saints with such a measure of life that they may have the giving gift and be able to give in simplicity
Based on this inspired speaking we may have the teaching, and based upon both prophesying and teaching we may have exhortation
In addition, we have those who are able to give material things to the church, care for the needy, and further the Lord's work
Finally, the believers live in the Body of Christ by living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love
In verse 9 Paul says, 'Let love be without hypocrisy,' and in verse 10 he continues, 'Love one another warmly in brotherly love'
We need the Holy Spirit to work in us and to give us an amount of transformation in love that we may practice love toward others
In verse 16 Paul admonishes us saying, 'Be of the same mind toward one another, not minding high things, but being led away to the lowly
In addition to the virtues that we need to have toward others, Paul also mentions virtues that we should have toward ourselves
In addition, as God's holy people we need to 'abhor what is evil' , 'conquer the evil with the good' , and 'cleave to what is good'
We Christians, who are separated unto God, must maintain the highest standard of behavior, a standard above that of moral and ethical people
As we are practicing the Body life living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life in love we should not avenge ourselves in any way
Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men because the other parties are not willing to have a life of peace
Because we are living not only before God but also before men, we need to take forethought for things honorable in the sight of men
From this, Paul goes on to the aspects of fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and members of the household of God
The church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God's children, nor even a Body for Christ
As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, but as the new man the church needs Christ as its person
In the creation of the one new man, however, God's nature has been wrought into man to make His nature one entity with humanity
The believers put on the new man by putting off the old man with its corrupted living in the lusts of the deceit
In Ephesians 4:22 the article before the word 'deceit' is emphatic and indicates that the word deceit is personified
To put off the old man is not merely to put off the old nature; it is to put off the old way of life, the former way of living
Our old way of living was not entirely an individualistic way of life, for it involved our social life, our community life
To put off the old man means not only to put off the self of the old man but also his worldly social relationships
The Lord's intention today is not simply to gather us together but to cause us to put off the life of the old man
As this process takes place, the mingled spirit enters our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind
The way to put on the new man is for our spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit, to become the spirit of our mind
For the spirit to become the spirit of our mind means that the spirit directs, controls, dominates, and possesses our mind
It is in this spirit of our mind that we are renewed, and by means of this spirit we put on the new man experientially
Now day by day we need to put on this new man by permitting the spirit to control our being and renew our mind
Ephesians 4:24 says that we 'have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth'
Because the new man has been created in Christ and with Christ according to God, the new man bears the image of God
Outwardly everything related to the new man is righteous, and inwardly everything related to the new man is holy
It was in the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created
Colossians 3:10 says that the new man 'is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him'
Today the church as the new man bears the image of God that is the new man bears Gods righteousness and holiness and also His love and light
Colossians 3:10 reveals that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge, which is according to the image of God
In our experience the new man must be renewed unto the full knowledge that is according to the image the expression of God who created him
The more we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, the more the new man with the divine element will spread from our spirit into our soul
The new man has Christ as all the members and in all the members, leaving no room for race, religion, culture, or social status
Vincent says that in the Greek language the words rendered 'cannot be' are very strong and mean that there is no possibility
In the new man there cannot be Greeks, who are for philosophical wisdom, and Jews, who are for miraculous signs
Circumcision refers to the observers of the Jewish religious ritual; uncircumcision refers to those who do not care for the Jewish religion
Because Christ is all the members of the new man, there is no room in the new man for any race, nationality, culture, or social status
If Paul did not say that Christ is in all, only that He is all, we may think that in the new man Christ is needed and that we are not needed
On the one hand, the Bible does say that in the new man there is no place for the natural person because Christ is all the members
In Ephesians 1:1 to 6:9 we have the revelation on the positive side concerning the church for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
Because of the working of Satan, who is the authority of darkness, the earth and its atmosphere have become 'this darkness'
We need to realize that our warfare is not against human beings but against the evil spirits, the spiritual powers in the heavenlies
In Ephesians 6:11 Paul says, 'Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the Devil'
Ephesians 6:13 says, 'Take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand'
Whether we put on the whole armor of God or take it up, we must exercise our will in a strong way to apply God's provision
By taking up the whole armor of God we shall be able 'to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand'
Truth in 6:14 refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and expressed by us as our living
Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the breastplate of righteousness, which covers our conscience, signified by the breast
No matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we still need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness
Flaming darts were used by fighters in the apostle's time, and the apostle uses this as an illustration of Satan's attacks on us
The shield is not something we put on; it is something we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy
If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we shall spontaneously have faith
In Ephesians 6:18 Paul says specifically that we are to pray in our spirit, that is, in our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
Pauls charge to pray in spirit implies that we should pray in the Spirit of God for the Spirit and our regenerated spirit are mingled in us
In verse 18 Paul goes on to speak of 'watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints'
With this message we shall begin to consider the believers' experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God in other aspects
We need to see that in order to carry out these matters, we need God's divine supply, which comes to us through His divine dispensing
If we would meet what the New Testament requires of the believers, we need the divine supply, even the very essence of the Triune God
The meekness required in the New Testament is much higher than that required by human teachings concerning morality ethics and human virtues
To meet the requirements of humility, meekness, gentleness, and love as revealed in the New Testament is impossible by our natural being
We need another being-the being of the processed Triune God dispensed into our being and even constituted into our being
In 1 Thessalonians 1:9b Paul says that the believers at Thessalonica 'turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God'
The fact that God controls us and directs us, even in such small things as our thoughts and motives, is a proof that He is living
As believers in Christ we must live a life which bears the testimony that the God we worship and serve is living in the details of our life
When we come to serve God or worship God we need to have a pure conscience a conscience purified from dead works or from any kind of offense
To worship in dead religion or to serve any dead thing rather than God does not require our conscience to be purified
The Greek word translated serve here means to serve in worship of God as used in Matthew 410 2 Timothy 13 Philippians 33 and Luke 237
In 2:29 he says that the genuine people of God must be in spirit, that true circumcision is not outward in the flesh but in the spirit
In the very first verse of this book Paul says that as a slave of Christ and a called apostle he was 'separated to the gospel of God'
If we have only the gospel concerning Christ as revealed in the first four books of the New Testament, our gospel is too objective
Our Christ is not merely the Christ in the flesh after incarnation and before resurrection, the Christ who was among His disciples
Although John 14 and 15 reveal that Christ will be in His disciples, that was not fulfilled before His resurrection
The book of Romans is the gospel of Christ after His resurrection, revealing that He is now the subjective Savior in His believers
The central message of the book of Romans is that sinful fleshly people can be made sons of God and conformed to the image of the Son of God
For Paul, the preaching of the gospel, the serving of God in the gospel of His Son, was a priestly ministry, a priestly service
To do this, we first need to know what the gospel is, and then we need to experience all that the gospel includes
We also need to learn how to minister the gospel to others, that is, how to function as priests in ministering the gospel of God
Whenever we contact anyone, whether a believer or an unbeliever, we need to know his need as far as the gospel is concerned
The crucial point in serving God in our spirit in the gospel of His Son is that we minister Christ to others in the gospel
Philippians 3:3a indicates that the only acceptable service and worship we can render to God is not by the flesh but by the Spirit of God
In typology the worship of God should be in the place chosen by God to set His habitation there and with the offerings
Christ is the fulfillment and reality of all the offerings with which God's people in the Old Testament worship Him
In the Old Testament Mount Zion, the place of God's habitation and the place of His name, was a type of the human spirit
The fact that the Judaizers had confidence in their circumcision was a sign that their confidence was in their flesh
Paul says strongly that we who believe in Christ serve by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh
As believers in Christ we should not trust in anything we have by our natural birth for everything of our natural birth is part of the flesh
In order to render genuine service and worship to God everything we do must be by the Spirit of God in Christ and with no trust in the flesh
We have seen that the believers experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity in serving and worshipping God
Disbelief in the truth of resurrection disappoints us concerning our future, thus discouraging us in the work for the Lord
Our work and labor for the Lord is not by our natural life and natural ability but by the Lord's resurrection life and power
We need to realize that 1 Corinthians 15:58 speaks of something in resurrection and is closely related to resurrection
Based upon what he has written in 15157 Paul encourages the believers to be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the Lord
As they work and labor for the Lord, the believers preach Christ as the gospel to sinners by preaching the word
Acts 8:4 tells us, 'Those therefore who were scattered went about the land bringing the good news of the word'
These verses are a further indication that the believers should preach Christ as the gospel to sinners by preaching the word
Now we come to the very important matter of ministering Christ as life to the saints with the nourishing words of the New Testament faith
A minister of Christ does not mainly denote a minister who belongs to Christ but a person who ministers Christ to others
A minister of Christ is one who serves others with Christ, ministering Christ as Savior, life, life supply, and every positive thing
To be a minister of Christ does not primarily mean to preach Christ, teach Christ, or tell others about Christ
While you are teaching them, you need to exercise your spirit to minister spiritual food that they may be nourished
Peter 5:2a says, 'Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God'
To shepherd according to God means according to Gods nature desire way and glory not according to mans preference interest and purpose
The elders must shepherd the saints as the flock of God altogether according to God's thought, feeling, will, and choice
The believers build up the church with the experiences of the processed Triune God as gold, silver, and precious stones
Gold, the first of the precious materials mentioned by Paul, refers to the first of the Trinity, God the Father
The third item of the precious materials mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:12 refers to the third of the Trinity, the Spirit
We need to discern the difference between the denominations, which include brothers and sisters in the Lord, and the church
We are building an organism-the Body of Christ-by being constituted of the Triune God, experiencing Him as gold, silver, and precious stones
Sometimes we must fast in order to deal with the power of darkness by casting out certain demons that insist on remaining
As the heavenly King, the Lord Jesus has such authority, but we need to pray, even with fasting, to execute the Lord's authority
To pray is not only to entreat the Lord to do things for His move; it is also to cause our spirit to be exercised and strengthened
These prophets and teachers were not conferring with men and organizing; rather, they were ministering to the Lord and fasting
Spiritually speaking, they were not at the altar in the outer court but were at the incense altar in the Holy Place
When they served the people, they ministered at the altar in the outer court, offering sacrifices to God for the people
The prophets and teachers in Antioch were at the incense altar at the Holy Place, ministering directly to the Lord through their prayers
The believers who work and labor for the Lord will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous
In 1 Corinthians 3:14 Paul says, 'If anyone's work which he has built upon it shall remain, he shall receive a reward'
The work that remains must be that of gold, silver, and precious stones, the product of faithful ministers of Christ
To give them food is to minister the Word of God with Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church
The faithful slave of the Lord will be set over all His possessions as a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
The resurrection of the righteous is the resurrection of life , when God will reward the saints at the Lord's return
In Matthew 25:34; John 17:15; Acts 17:24; Ephesians 1:4; and Revelation 13:8 it denotes the material universe as a system created by God
In John 1:29; 3:16; and Romans 5:12 it denotes the fallen human race corrupted and usurped by Satan as components for his evil world system
In 1 John 215 as in John 1519 1714 and James 44 it denotes an order a set form an orderly arrangement hence an ordered system not the earth
Everything, everyone, and every matter have been systematized by the evil one, the adversary of God, and made a part of his world system
One by one these courses enslave and possess man causing him completely to forsake and forget God and go along with the current of the world
The world denotes the enemys scheme system and organization to usurp the place of God in man and eventually to gain full possession of man
The world in verse 15 denotes an evil, Satanic, anti-God system that is constituted of the things created by God
Because the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil entered into the human race, our body became fallen and corrupted
The vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life
The Greek word rendered 'life' in 2:16 is bios, a word that refers to the physical life and also to the present life
John 2:17 says, 'The world is passing away, and its lust, but he who practices the will of God abides forever'
As the world is against God the Father, so the things in the world, which are its lust, are against the will of God
According to verse 17, the world is passing away and its lust, but he who practices the will of God abides forever
We have seen that everything, everyone, and every matter have been systematized by Satan and made a part of his world system
Because everything, everyone, and every matter have been systematized by Satan, we need to flee to the Triune God and His Word
He is not only God's enemy outside of God's kingdom but also the adversary within God's kingdom, rebelling against God
We can apply the blood to answer all of Satans accusation and thus we can be strong and of good courage before the enemy and fight with him
We must declare what the Lord has accomplished, the victory of the cross, the attainment of resurrection, and the position of ascension
Loving ourselves and caring for ourselves will cause us to lose the position of warfare and to be unable to fight against the enemy
To be humble toward God, that is, to be subject to God, is to withstand the Devil, that is, to stand against the Devil
Your adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion walks about, seeking someone to devour; whom withstand, firm in the faith'
In 2 Corinthians 2:11 Paul says, 'That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his thoughts'
The Greek word translated 'thoughts' here means plans, plots, devices, schemes, designs, wiles, intentions, purposes
As the context indicates, even a matter such as forgiving a brother may involve not only the church but also the devices of Satan
Even behind a matter such as this, Satan may be crouching, looking for a way to execute his evil plans and devour the weak ones
In 2 Thessalonians 3:3 Paul says, 'The Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one'
The whole world lies in the evil one , but the divine life with which we have been born of God keeps and guards us from him
On the positive side, the main point of these verses is God's dispensation; on the negative side, it is the differing teachings
The charge given by the apostle to his spiritual son concerns the dispensation of God positively and the differing teachings negatively
Because of different teachings, the church had already become degraded, and a deviation from the faith had taken place
Paul charged Timothy to fight against this deviation from the faith, that is, to fight the good fight for the faith
In verse 18 Paul says that he committed the charge to Timothy 'according to the prophecies previously made' concerning him
We were born of the human natural life, but we were reborn of the divine eternal life when we were called by God in Christ
We fight the good fight of the faith not only objectively but also subjectively by laying hold on eternal life
Having been called to eternal life, we now should lay hold on this life, live this life, and have our whole being according to this life
Not only heretical teachings but even fundamental teachings may be used by the enemy to keep us from enjoying the eternal life
In 1 Timothy 6:12a Paul says, 'Fight the good fight of the faith,' and in 2 Timothy 4:7c he says, 'I have kept the faith'
In these verses 'the faith' refers not to our subjective believing but to our objective belief, that is, to what we believe
The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith , in which we believe for our common salvation
Paul says, 'Holding faith and a good conscience, which some thrusting away have become shipwrecked regarding the faith'
We believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God incarnated as man, lived on earth and died on the cross for our sins to secure our redemption
Because we believe in Him, our sins have been forgiven, He has come into us as our life, and we have been regenerated
The law was given in the Old Testament, but what God gives in the New Testament is the faith that includes all the items of God's new will
That is not the correct understanding of what Jude means by contending for the faith once for all delivered to the saints
Someone may tell you that Jesus died on the cross not for redemption but because He was a martyr and sacrificed Himself for His teachings
The faith, the common faith, has been delivered to the saints once for all, and what we need to do now is to contend for it
In 1 Corinthians 9:24 Paul says, 'Do you not know that those who run in a race-course all run, but one receives the prize?
Although Christ is our way, we should not take this way as a way; rather, we should take the way as a race to run
Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work , whereas reward is for our work after we are saved
We may not receive a reward but rather suffer loss, even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve
With this reward in view, Paul charged the believers to run the race so that they may obtain the reward, the prize, an incorruptible crown
The runners in a race must strip off every unnecessary weight every encumbering burden that they may have no impediment to running the race
If we would run the Christian race, we need to put off every encumbrance, every unnecessary burden or impediment
In order to run this race, we must suffer the opposition with endurance, never growing weary or fainting in our souls
The Greek word translated 'looking away unto' means to look with undivided attention by turning away from every other object
In the book of Hebrews Paul points us particularly to the Christ seated in heaven with so many aspects to care for us in every way
