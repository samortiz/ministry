C.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. I tried to commit suicide by hanging myself a few times because I could not stand the constant pressure. I became very pessimistic and thought of becoming a monk. First, I became a vegetarian, and then I joined a monastery. Later I heard the gospel in my sister-in-law's house and was saved. My parents opposed my faith and always tried to bother me when I prayed. These persecutions forced me to build up a sweeter fellowship with the Lord.</p><p>I went into the salt business, but I did not have the peace to stay in that business because there was tax evasion related to that business. I left for other jobs. When my second daughter became sick and was about to die, I had the Lord's word. It was the story of Elisha with the son of the Shunammite woman. I kept this word in my heart and did not consult the doctors. I prayed unceasingly. My father prepared a coffin for her, but the Lord told me that I did not need to pray anymore but that I should praise Him instead. I began to sing and to praise the Lord. After two or three days, my daughter gradually recovered. Once we had to move to another house, but my wife and I were not in one accord. We knelt down to pray, and the Lord touched my wife and told her to submit. We were able to move in peace. In hearing all the messages on the mountain and in comparing them with my experiences, I have found that I am short in everything. I thought about quitting and giving up serving the Lord. But I realized that I have handed myself over and that I have no right to do anything according to my will. The Lord has to make the decision. I have been saved for over ten years, but I still make mistakes in many things. I can only look to the Lord today and ask for His mercy. I want to be like a newly regenerated person, starting all over again.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother clearly has handed himself over to the Lord. Therefore, his future should be decided by the church. We have some brothers who have returned from southeast Asia, and they tell us that a rubber tree must be cut before it will yield its sap. Similarly, a pine tree must be cut before it will yield resin. A man must be cut by God and dealt with by Him before life will flow out. In talking to others or in working with them, we have to give them the impression that we are very close to them. We should not give them the feeling that we are unapproachable. The Lord arranges circumstances around us in order to cut us. Once we suffer a cut, we become very approachable. Some people release their spirit as soon as they open their mouths or as soon as they pray. Once we have a wound, the sap flows, and we become very approachable. When some people preach, their spirit is released. When others preach, their spirit is not released. Older ones can release their spirit more easily. If the young ones will humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, they also will release their spirit quickly. Our brother has been running a straight course. However, he still needs to receive some cutting from God's knife so that he will have a wound and his shell will be broken. When this happens, he will be released and life will flow. He will become approachable and will be able to touch others. I hope you will lift up your head and say, "Lord, I am willing to let You work on me, whether this work is gradual or sudden. May You inflict a wound on me, and may I afford You a way to go on."</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 54</div><br></body></html>
