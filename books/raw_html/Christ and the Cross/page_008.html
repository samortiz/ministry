        <h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION JOINING CHRIST<br />
AND HIS REDEEMED AS ONE</h2>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s plan, Christ did not accomplish an objective redemption that is apart from man and apart from the things redeemed by Christ. Rather, Christ entered into humanity in order to be joined to man so that He might accomplish a subjective salvation in man from within man.</p>
<p>The first step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption was incarnation (John 1:14). By becoming flesh, Christ was joined to man and thereby joined to all creation. He was conceived in Mary and born in Bethlehem, but His conception was not merely an individual matter. His conception represented God entering into mankind, into creation. Bethlehem is not just a place; Bethlehem represents the universe. Christ&rsquo;s conception in Mary was His entering into creation, and His being born in Bethlehem was His being born in the universe. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation was His coming into man and into creation in order to be joined as one with man and with creation.</p>
<p>Even though all things came out of Christ and were created by Christ and even though man was created according to the image of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s life and nature did not enter into man or into creation until the incarnation. In the garden of Eden Adam had Christ&rsquo;s image and likeness, but Adam did not have Christ&rsquo;s life and nature, because God had not yet entered into man to be joined with him. Even though man now lives in a wicked world, is ruined by sin, and has lost God&rsquo;s image and glory, man can receive God because God entered into man through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation for the accomplishment of redemption. Although Adam&rsquo;s perfect created humanity was defiled, Christ still came to be joined with man. This is the first step that Christ took in accomplishing God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>When Christ entered into man, He entered into creation, because man represents creation. By being joined with man, Christ was joined with creation. In the future in the new heaven and new earth Christ will be in man and will fill all things, and the glory of His radiance will be manifested by man, through man, and in all things. However, Christ Himself is not waiting for that day. In His incarnation He was mingled with man and joined to His creation. He was the Creator entering into creation to be mingled with man, as seen in the thirty-three and a half years that He lived on the earth. When Christ changed water into wine and fed five thousand with five loaves and two fish (John 2:1-11; Matt. 14:14-21), He was the Creator in creation and who was joined with creation.</p>
<p>The second step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption was crucifixion. On the cross Christ was crucified in the humanity of His creation. Being joined to man and, hence, to all things, He tasted death on behalf of man and all things in order to deliver them from God&rsquo;s judgment (Heb. 2:9). Furthermore, He terminated the old creation and delivered man and all creation from Satan&rsquo;s corruption (Rom. 6:6). Christ died on our behalf, and in His union with us He took us to the cross to die with Him.</p>
<p>The third step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption was His resurrection from the dead. In this step Christ brought all things that were part of Him through incarnation and that had died with Him through crucifixion into His divine life. In incarnation Christ entered into humanity in order for Him to be joined with man, and in His resurrection from the dead He brought man into Himself in order for man to be joined with Him. Through incarnation God became a man with the human life and nature, and in resurrection His redeemed ones received God&rsquo;s divine life and nature in order to become one with Him.</p>
<p>The fourth step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption is His second coming. In His second coming He will redeem the bodies of those who are joined to Him in His life, bring them into His glory, and free all things from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of His glory (8:17-23; Phil. 3:20-21). Then Christ will be expressed and glorified not only in the people who are redeemed and joined to Him but also in all things. His people will possess His image, life, and glory to be fully joined to Him and to be the same as He is in image, life, and glory so that all things may be filled with Him and express His glory. The issue of God&rsquo;s redemption in Christ is Christ&rsquo;s being joined to His redeemed people as one and to all things so that He may be &ldquo;all and in all&rdquo; (Col. 3:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE FIRSTBORN FROM THE DEAD<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>In creation Christ is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation&rdquo; (1:15), and in redemption He is &ldquo;the Firstborn from the dead&rdquo; (v. 18), that is, the first to resurrect from the dead. <em>The Firstborn of all creation</em> means that Christ is preeminent in creation; all creation was created in Him and came forth from Him. <em>The Firstborn from the dead</em> means that Christ is the first in resurrection; every person who resurrects from the dead will resurrect in Christ.</p>
<p>In creation Christ is the Firstborn in order to create all things, and in redemption Christ is the Firstborn in order to produce the church. All things were created through Him, and the church was brought forth through His resurrection. Christ is the first in creation in order to create all things, and He is the first in resurrection in order to produce the church. In relation to all things, He is the first in creation, and in relation to the church, He is the first in resurrection. Whether in relation to all created things or in relation to the church in resurrection, God has made Christ first so that He might have the first place in all things.</p>
<p>Christ is not only the Creator but also a creature, the Firstborn of all creation, so that He might have the first place in God&rsquo;s creation. Furthermore, Christ is not only the Redeemer; He also resurrected as the Firstborn from the dead so that He might have the first place in God&rsquo;s redemption. Hence, whether in God&rsquo;s creation or in God&rsquo;s redemption, Christ is everything and has the first place, because God delights that Christ would be all things, be above all things, and have the first place in all things (v. 18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING IN GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Christ is everything in creation, but creation does not have His life and nature and cannot become a part of Him. In contrast, Christ is everything in redemption, and He can enter into His redeemed people to be their life so that they become a part of Him. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, Christ not only enters into His redeemed people but also brings them into Himself to receive His life and nature so that they might be joined to Him as one in life and nature for His expression.</p>
<p>Christ is not only the means and power of God&rsquo;s redemption, nor is He merely the beginning, the course, and the end of God&rsquo;s redemption. Christ is God&rsquo;s redemption. God&rsquo;s redemption is not only out of Christ, through Christ, and for Christ; God&rsquo;s redemption is Christ. Christ not only accomplished God&rsquo;s redemption; He is God&rsquo;s redemption. He is everything in God&rsquo;s redemption. One day we will see that the Redeemer is Christ, and the redeemed are Christ as well. The content of God&rsquo;s redemption is Christ, and the purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is Christ. Christ is everything in redemption, because God planned that redemption is for Christ to be all and in all.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
