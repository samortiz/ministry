   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first basic constituent of a prophecy is the personal knowledge of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To gain such a knowledge, we need to get acquainted with the Word of God literally.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should even memorize many crucial verses in the Bible.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should also memorize verses such as John 3:6, 16, and 36; John 14:26 and 15:26; and John 15:16 and Romans 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, we need to devise a particular way that will enable us to remember the book, chapter, and verse number of the crucial verses.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Apostle Paul also was acquainted with the Word of God literally.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nearly all the verses of the Bible bear a deeper denotation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verses such as John 3:16 not only bear a denotation on the surface, but they also contain something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible is deep, and no one can understand it completely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Underneath its surface are many secrets and mysteries.</S>
