<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Firstfruits of the Feast of the Firstfruits,<br>after Being Offered to God for His Enjoyment,<br>to Be Eaten by the People of Israel</H2><P>The firstfruits of the Feast of the Firstfruits, after being offered to God for His enjoyment, were to be eaten by the people of Israel. This signifies that the resurrected Christ, after being presented to God in His freshness (John 20:16-17), is to be dispensed, with all the riches of His resurrection, into us for our enjoyment (Lev. 23:14; 1 Cor. 15:14, 17; Rom. 4:25b; Phil. 3:10a, 11b). According to the record of Leviticus 23, the offering of only one of the seven feasts, the Feast of the Firstfruits, was to be eaten. As we have seen, the firstfruits refer to Christ in His resurrection. The firstfruits were not to be eaten immediately after being reaped. This signifies that after the reaping we must first offer Christ to God in His freshness. This is unveiled in John 20. On the morning of the resurrection Mary saw the Lord Jesus. When she tried to touch Him, the Lord said, "Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (v. 17). Christ became our portion only after His freshness in resurrection had first been offered to the Father.</P><P>Whatever Christ is as our portion to be eaten is related to His resurrection. The blood of the Passover lamb signifies the crucified Christ, but the meat of the lamb signifies the resurrected Christ. The blood was from the crucified Christ, but the meat refers to the Christ who is in resurrection. If Christ were not the Spirit in resurrection, we could not take Him in. The crucified Christ alone is not our life supply; only Christ in resurrection can be our life supply. The unleavened bread of the Passover was made of grain that had been ground and blended to be one loaf, signifying death and resurrection. Therefore, both the meat of the lamb and the unleavened bread signify Christ as the Spirit in His resurrection. It is Christ in His resurrection who dispenses Himself into us as many items. This is why the offering of only one of the seven feasts, the Feast of the Firstfruits, was to be eaten.</P><P>According to the type of the feasts, what we enjoy and what is being dispensed into us is the resurrected Christ. The resurrected Christ is the consummated Triune God. In eternity past God was not yet consummated, but after He passed through the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God was consummated. Now He possesses the divine nature and a human nature with incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now He is the processed, consummated, and compound God. It is such a One who is good for us to eat and who, in His resurrection and consummation, dispenses Himself into us.</P>
