<h2 class="head2">The Gathering at Armageddon<br />
and a Warning to the Remaining Believers</h2>
<p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;And I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits as frogs.&rdquo; As a satanic trinity, Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet will work as one. Verses 14 to 16 continue, &ldquo;For they are spirits of demons doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty. (Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments that he may not walk naked and they see his shame.) And they gathered them to the place which in Hebrew is called, Armageddon.&rdquo; As we have seen, Armageddon is the place of the winepress of the fury of God (14:17-20).</p>
<p>Although these events will transpire close to the end of the three and a half years, the warning in 16:15 indicates that even at that time there will still be some believers remaining on the earth. Because of this, the best Bible students differentiate between the firstfruits and the harvest. Revelation 16:15 is a warning to the living majority of believers who still remain on this earth.</p>
<p>In a field of grain, some of the stocks of grain are higher; these are the firstfruits which ripen first. Because the majority of the crop is still green, it requires a few more weeks to ripen. Therefore, we should not think that there is only one rapture. Even the rapture of the overcomers is of more than one kind; Revelation 12:5 mentions the rapture of the man-child, and 14:1-5 speaks of the hundred and forty-four thousand firstfruits who are raptured to the throne of God.</p>
<p>The truth of the partial rapture is also strengthened by the Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Philadelphia in 3:10 which says, &ldquo;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.&rdquo; The hour of trial is the great tribulation. Here, the Lord promised the overcomers in the church in Philadelphia that since they have kept the word of His endurance, He will keep them not only out of the trial, but out of the hour of trial. To be kept from the hour of trial is to be raptured before the time of the great tribulation. Therefore, these three passages&mdash;Revelation 3:10, 12:5, and 14:1-5&mdash;tell us that some believers will be raptured before the hour of the great tribulation, before the last three and a half years of this age. Different portions of the rapture are indicated by 14:14-16 and 16:15. In addition, there is another small rapture, the rapture of the two witnesses in 11:12. They are raptured in a particular way because they are special witnesses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Seventh Bowl</h2>
<p>Revelation 16:17-19 says, &ldquo;And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were lightnings and voices and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not been since man appeared on the earth, such an earthquake, so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the Great was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath.&rdquo; Verse 17 once again mentions the temple. The great city in verse 19 is Jerusalem, and Babylon the Great here is the material aspect of Babylon. The fall of religious Babylon is mentioned in 14:8, while the fall of material Babylon is mentioned here in 16:19. In 14:8 the religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, made the nations drunk with the wine of the fury of her fornication, while in 16:19 the Lord makes the material Babylon drink the wine of the fury of His wrath.</p>
<p>Verses 20 and 21 continue, &ldquo;And every island fled, and the mountains were not found. And great hail, every stone about the weight of a talent, came down out of heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague of it is exceedingly great.&rdquo; The situation at that time will truly be awful! Every hailstone will have the weight of a talent, which equals about one hundred pounds. This will be a great plague. Because God will thoroughly damage the kingdom of Antichrist, not many people from this part of the world may remain until the coming back of the Lord Jesus. The number of the living Gentiles whom the Lord will divide into the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25 will be made fewer by all these calamities which will be increasingly intensified.</p>
