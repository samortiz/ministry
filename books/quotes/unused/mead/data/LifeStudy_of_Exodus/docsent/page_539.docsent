   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SALT OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>APPLIED TO OUR PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the element of the salt with which we are salted?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This element is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s coming to us is not a matter of the daily working of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, His coming is altogether in the oil, in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, our going to God requires the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need the cross all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The salt here signifies the cross of Christ, His killing death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to experience the killing death of Christ in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I can testify that I have much experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If my motive, intention, and heart are not pure, I am not able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, if my spirit has some kind of bias, I cannot pray either.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to pray, my spirit must be without bias, and my motive and intention must be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be pure in this way requires salt; it requires the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Young people may realize that if they commit sins, they will find it very difficult to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But as we grow in the Lord and come to a finer stage in the spiritual life, we shall see that even a little bias in our spirit can keep us from praying properly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not necessary to sin in order to have your prayer hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even a small amount of bias in your spirit can hinder your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may still pray if you have bias in your spirit, but deep within you may realize that this is not the kind of prayer the Lord desires.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I dare not say whether or not the Lord will answer a prayer that issues from a biased spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, I am assured that this is not the kind of prayer He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I also know that such prayer does not have a pleasant fragrance to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, He finds the odor of that kind of prayer very offensive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times our prayer has been altogether offensive and unpleasant to the Lord s sense of smell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe that those saints with experience can endorse this word and say amen to it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From their experience they know that prayer which issues from impure motives or from bias in our spirit is offensive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE INCENSE TEMPERED WITH SALT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By now we should be clear that for God s coming to us the Spirit, the oil, is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But for our going to God the cross, the salt, is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both the oil and the salt are tempering elements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The oil tempers the ointment for God to come to us, but the salt tempers the incense for us to go to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our prayer needs to be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the Bible in its clear portrait concerning our prayer indicates that what is needed is mainly the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you intend to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As you are about to pray, you need to be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your natural being, your natural way, your natural thought, your natural desire, your natural preference, your natural choice all must be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You probably do not realize how many unclean elements or how much dirt there is in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is dirt in your mind, in your emotion, and in your will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There may be much defilement both in your love and in your hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, unclean elements may be expressed by your utterances in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that even in your prayer there may be uncleanness or defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The prayer of some can be likened to the eruption of a volcano: it bursts forth with the release of many unclean things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These ones may feel that they are praying to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, they are expelling much uncleanness from their inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In emphasizing our need to be salted, I am not saying that there is no need for the Spirit in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do need the Spirit, but that is not our greatest need.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our greatest need is the cross, the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For us to enjoy God the main element needed is oil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When God comes to us to be our enjoyment, He must be the oil, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, it is necessary for God Himself to be oil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, there would be no way for us to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But for us to go to God in prayer, we need plenty of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to be salted thoroughly and absolutely.</S>
