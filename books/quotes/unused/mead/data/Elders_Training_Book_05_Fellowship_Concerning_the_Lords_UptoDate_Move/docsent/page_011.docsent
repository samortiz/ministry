   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING CONSTITUTED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE MAJOR TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us now consider the practicality of being constituted with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The highest truth in the Lord s recovery is the truth concerning the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the highest truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first noun used as a subject in the Bible is God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the beginning God created Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God in this verse indicates the Trinity since the Hebrew word for God Elohim is plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In that same chapter God said to Himself, Let us plural make man in our image v. 26 . The Trinity is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Also, the structure of the entire New Testament is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the highest truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because this truth is mysterious, however, it is hard for people to apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, clever people try their best to avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, years ago in the recovery the Lord began to show us that the Trinity is not just a doctrinal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Trinity is for us to enjoy our very God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not a doctrine, but the very Trinity for you to enjoy Christ, God, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This one verse involves these three divine Persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians only have an objective Triune God far away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They do not care for the experience of the Triune God, yet they use 2 Corinthians 13:14 as a benediction given on Sunday mornings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord has shown us that the divine Trinity is not for doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is for our enjoyment, and He has begun to bring us into the enjoyment of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the recovery came to this country and I began to minister, many messages have been given on this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some even consider that the divine Trinity is my hobby.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Though I have spoken much and have printed many messages, I am a little concerned for you brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I doubt that many of you have entered into the complete truth of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a young boy the first time I ever went to any kind of Christian chapel was on Christmas eve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first thing I saw was Santa Claus and some big socks, Christmas stockings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My mother told me that was the celebration of Christmas concerning the Lord s birth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She had already told me how Jesus was born of a virgin and how He was put into a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In all of Christianity they celebrate the Lord s birth and they teach the Lord s birth, but nearly no one has ever studied what the conception is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our training on Luke we defined how the conception was initiated by the divine element entering into the womb of the human virgin to be mingled with the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually what was born was a God-man, born of two elements, the divine and the human.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Things like this we have studied and have put in writing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose you would be asked what the conception of Jesus Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may say, Well, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit in a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then some thoughtful person would ask, What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You might answer, Well, it s hard to say.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not the adequate answer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are talking about the incarnation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to know how He was incarnated and we have to teach people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This has very much to do with the laying of a good foundation for the saints to enjoy the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even as a young boy, I was told by my mother that Jesus was so good, that He did a lot of miracles, and that He was so humble and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But nearly no one, according to my knowledge, ever studied the human living of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Was that a man s living or was that God s living?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you say that was God s living, then I would ask, What kind of God?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Was that just the Son or the Father or the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By His mercy we have studied to such an extent that we can say that His living was the living of a God-man who is the Son of God with the Father by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just these two prepositional phrases, with the Father and by the Spirit require at least one week of study.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have to find the verses that prove that when Jesus was living on this earth, even as a carpenter in a poor house, He lived as the Son with the Father John 8:16, 29; 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You also have to be able to prove that He lived by the Spirit Matt 4:1; 12:28; Luke 4:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is the need of such a thorough study of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then, when He reached the age of thirty and before He began to minister, He was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After being baptized in water He stood up, the Holy Spirit as a dove descended upon Him, and the Father spoke from the heavens Matt 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Was Jesus not conceived of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Was He not born of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then why at His baptism did the Holy Spirit descend upon Him and the Father speak from the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not so easy to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But thank the Lord, in His mercy He showed us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In His light we have picked up two terms, the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord Jesus was born of the Spirit essentially, but the Spirit s descending upon Him and the Father s speaking from above was something economical.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then following this, He worked in the same way as He lived with the Father by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then He went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Who went to the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Who died there?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Who was crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Who was nailed on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Could God be nailed there?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On what basis could you have the boldness to tell people God was crucified there?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Acts 20:28 says that God obtained the church with His own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If God never died on the cross how could He shed His blood?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You may say that you cannot understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Actually, there are many things that we cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even you cannot understand yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You cannot understand the food you eat every day.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not take the excuse that you cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That God has shed His blood is a fact recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First John 1:7 speaks of the blood of Jesus His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The blood is of a person with two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As Jesus, He is a person who is constituted with the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As the Son of God He is constituted with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Without the divine element His redemption could never be eternal, and the efficacy of the power of His redemption would not be insured.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As a man He could only die for one person, but as the eternal God with the eternal element, His death is for millions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>His death is an eternal death, His redemption an eternal redemption Heb 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He was dying with the eternal, divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hebrews 9:14 tells us that He offered Himself through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Is this the eternal essential Spirit or the eternal economical Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need to jump out of the shallow way of understanding the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should not be those skating on the ice of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need to break the ice and get into the depths of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This requires much labor.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You need to study the Bible, to study the proper reference books, and to study thousands of pages in the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You need to study the messages, not just to read through them as if you were reading a newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You have a good heart to put the Life-studies on your shelves, but what has entered into you?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What has been constituted into your being?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the last chapter of Revelation the Lord told us He would come soon Rev 22:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Two thousand years have passed, and He has not come yet.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Who delayed Him?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We delayed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The believers delayed Him by ignorance, by not having a full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Under the ignorance of all the believers, the Lord just could not find a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This ignorance is still prevailing today.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Darkness is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Where is the sky clear and where is the real enlightenment?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There may be a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement, but no light.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This kind of excitement is under darkness, and anything that is under darkness is nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>According to this present situation the Lord nearly has no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The first thing He has to do is to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In His old creation, the first item He brought in was light.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Let there be light Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We need the enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>His word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path Psa 119:105 and the entrance of His words gives light Psa 119:130 .</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We need much proper apprehension of the word of the truth which is the real light to us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We need the enlightenment; then we could see the real significance of His incarnation, of His human living, and of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>On the cross He died an all-inclusive death with seven aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>See message 53 of the Life-study of Luke, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>459-462 .</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Could you speak this without any preparation?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>To do this you need a constitution of all these points of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Then it is so easy for you to present the seven aspects of the all-inclusive death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Instead of caring for this we may care for the shallow things, the superficial things.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Who cares for the deep things today?</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Saints, are we really in the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Do we really mean business?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If so, then why do we not have any interest in these deeper things of the divine economy?</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>It is not a small matter to know the death of Christ in an all-inclusive way, but who would labor to study these things?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Actually, someone has labored already.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>All these matters have been put into print.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>It only requires you to have a heart to spend about twenty minutes, then you would get every aspect of this all-inclusive death constituted into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>You read about the aspects of the Lord s death in the Life-studies but nothing is left within you.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>These things come and go.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This is the tragedy in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Anyone who teaches without the proper knowledge of the truth will make a lot of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>After having cataracts and cataract surgery twice I am now unqualified to drive a car.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>If you ask me to drive, I will drive in a nonsensical way.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>For you to travel to various places to minister the Word without the proper knowledge of the truth is like a blind man driving a car.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>You are traveling and doing the work, but you do not know how much damage you have caused.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>You are enthusiastic to do the work of the Lord, but how do you do the work?</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>With what do you do the work?</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>What do you preach?</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>What do you teach?</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>These are big questions.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>In the same principle, what do the responsible ones teach the saints in their locality?</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>I would propose that we all take care of and study three items.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>The first is the Triune God embodied in Christ, and the Spirit being His realization and also the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>The second is the seven major steps taken by our Triune God: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, breathing the Spirit, ascension, and pouring out the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Then, let us study as the third item the finalization of the intensification of the Triune God as the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>I hope that all the elders would be constituted with these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Then we could be apt to teach these things.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>This does not mean that we no longer need the lessons for the new beginners.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>We are still bringing forth a number of new ones so we need lessons for them.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Brothers, will you take this proposal?</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>I assure you that it will cost you at least two or three months to get into these major and basic truths.</S>
