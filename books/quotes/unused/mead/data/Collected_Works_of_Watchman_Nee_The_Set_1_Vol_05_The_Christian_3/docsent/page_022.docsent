   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we consider the example of Paul, we will see how he ignored all present failures to look single-heartedly to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we read 1 and 2 Corinthians and Galatians, we find how his views transcended the defeated Corinthians and the fallen Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sin committed among the Corinthians was shocking; one committed fornication which was not even heard of among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul had to warn them, but before he mentioned the sin, he first said, "Who the Lord will also confirm you until the end unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord" 1 Cor 1:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul discerned their source.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That was why he could see light amidst darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Galatians were no different.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Paul wrote to them, he rebuked them because they had begun by the Spirit but were trying to be perfected by the flesh Gal 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They had forsaken the position of grace and were once again bound by the yoke of slavery Gal 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The apostle could not help but warn them severely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when the apostle considered the source of faith, his words were again full of hope: "I am confident in the Lord concerning you that you will be of no other mind" 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not have confidence in them; he had confidence in the condition that they could be in.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our hearts must treasure and long after everything of Christ and everything the church should be to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will deepen our sense of the failure of the church and will cause us to realize Christ's preserving power in the midst of all failures.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way, although the sense of failure has not diminished, our faith in Christ will be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How steady our Christian life will then be!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we believe in is not how much the church is for Christ, but how much Christ is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How kind is the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a wonderful opening word the Lord had for the messenger in Sardis!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before He mentioned their terrible condition, He first revealed Himself as the One who holds all the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This serves as the source for the believers' faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how much failure and sins advance, the fullness and power of the Holy Spirit is still the same, for they are not determined by the work of the believers on earth but by the worth of the Lord's work in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the old days, the Lord spoke to the defeated Israelites through the mouth of the prophet Haggai: "According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my Spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not" 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same way now, the Lord is speaking to the defeated church, "These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now the Lord begins to speak of the condition of this church: "I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here the Lord is not saying that the messenger in Sardis was not regenerated or that he did not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We know that Sardis is also a lampstand in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord was not saying that it did not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, He was saying that it was short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord did not say that it had become totally lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, He said that in works it was living in name but dead in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we consider the various uses of the word "dead" in the New Testament, we will realize that here it does not mean to be altogether void of spiritual life; it merely means that there was the lack of vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Timothy 5:6 says, "But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while living."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The context here shows us that this widow was not void of life or unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the same principle, the Lord rebuked Peter and called him "Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostle also called a saved Christian "the evil man" 1 Cor 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the Lord was not referring to whether or not this messenger and this church had life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, He was speaking of their works being dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Christian receives life at the time he is regenerated, but it is possible for him to be without any vitality in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we consider the following warning and exhortation of the Lord, we will realize that what they lacked was not salvation but watchfulness in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, we believe that this word of the Lord refers also to many unsaved nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Protestant churches, nominally speaking, everyone belongs to the Lord, but actually, there are many who are the Lord's in name only.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are not the Lord's in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the Lord's word here refers directly to the messenger of the church in Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were saved, yet they lacked the vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They have been separated from the Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Word of God has been reinstated in its proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some of the truths are also recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, in their organizations they lack the most important element, the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In their churches, or denominations, there are still many so-called, nominal members who are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's saints are scattered among many unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They themselves are living, yet they have no strength to enliven the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the condition of the Protestant church after the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is living in name and dead in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A part of Protestantism is living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This causes its fraudulence to become more extensive than that found in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now it has received a name that it is living, yet in reality, it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Reformation gave us two things: an open Bible and a gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These two things are the greatest treasures for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We thank the Lord that He has bestowed such grace upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot honor enough those whom the Lord used to bring about the Reformation and who conveyed the truth to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God honored them and entrusted to them the greatest work in the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the same time, we should not make the truth received through the Reformation the standard of all truth, as some have done.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do this, we fall into error.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God honored those who carried out the Reformation, and God honors His own work in the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this letter to the people in Sardis, God did not judge the ones who brought about the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Perhaps God has purposely hidden the matter of the Reformation in these seven letters so that saints would not take the Reformation as the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Actually, those who were faithful in the Reformation would never take what the Bible had not said.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If anyone comes to know the significance of the Reformation, he will never trust in the Reformation more than the Bible honored by the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The purpose of the Reformation was to turn man back to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If saints realize that the Reformation is to turn man back to the Bible, and that to turn to the Reformation is to turn to the Bible, they will be saved from errors.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The greatest goal of the Reformation was to show that nothing is trustworthy except the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It seems to me that the Reformers would probably have been the last ones to consider the Reformation as the authority and the standard or to agree with such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We know that the church at the time of the Reformation did receive some light, some deliverance, and some freedom, but there was no recovery concerning Christ, concerning the Holy Spirit, and concerning the truth of the church.</S>
