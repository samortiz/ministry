   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LOSS OF ZEAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While things are quiet, there is a danger of losing the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even our own history in the past years has shown this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some left they fell away or were stumbled but the ones who have remained have gradually become indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is the same problem in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The work, the testimony, started on the China mainland with much zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was spread by the same zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But today from my observation of the situation in the Far East, it seems the zeal is diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As I told the brothers there, I am very much concerned about this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The churches of the Lord s recovery in the United States, even though they are much younger, are also in this danger.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With the new churches the problem is not that great, but with the established churches, the danger is surely here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This lukewarmness will no doubt issue in emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By emptiness we mean a shortage of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are devoid of Christ, we are short of the Spirit and short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually these three are one, yet we have to make them three items.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without the Spirit, we don t have the experience of Christ; if we don t have the experience of Christ, we don t have much life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I feel very burdened about the present condition of the Lord s recovery on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To my observation it seems that not many churches still have zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When some of you brothers came into the recovery, you came in with a zeal that was burning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now your knowledge has increased, your experience has become more than in the past, but your zeal is less than it was when you first came in.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>KNOWLEDGE BUT NOT TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may have more knowledge, but this does not mean we have more truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the New Testament revelation, truth is the issue of light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is doctrine?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is truth?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Knowledge without light is doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Knowledge full of light is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Doctors of theology may have much knowledge of the Bible, but they may not have much light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Life-studies may be just doctrine to you, or they may be truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The difference is that when you have the knowledge with light, it is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the light, it is only doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You can get doctrines without loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may go to a seminary or to a Bible college and gain a lot of knowledge, but you may not receive light because light is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He never tells us that He is knowledge; He says He is the light John 8:12 and the truth John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we don t love the Lord, we may come to the Bible, we may have morning watch, but what we read may be just knowledge without light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have the Lord s presence mingled in our knowledge, then that knowledge is the truth because the Lord s presence is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So you see, we may even lose the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No Christ, no light, no spirit, no truth reality .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then what is there?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Emptiness, just emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must have a zeal to seek after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the Bible helps, the Life-studies help help to get not doctrines but the truth, the real knowledge with light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we have the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We, the leading ones, should not put too many requirements on the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We ourselves have to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we don t take the lead to be zealous after the Lord but expect others to be zealous, whatever we say becomes a doctrine, or a teaching, all with no impact.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even in the Old Testament we have this verse: The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up Psa 69:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Old Testament prophets, like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were all zealots.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they lost their zeal, they were no longer prophets; the word would not come to them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The word that came to the Old Testament prophets was truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fresh word out of their mouths was full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The speakings of the prophets were not doctrines without light; their word was full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, it became truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Most Christians do not differentiate knowledge and doctrine from truth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From the second third of the last century to the first third of this century many Christian books came out with many truths, full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It has not been so in the past fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead of truth, emptiness has filled the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This might possibly be the peril we may fall into.</S>
