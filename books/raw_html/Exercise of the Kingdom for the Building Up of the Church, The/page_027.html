 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INCENTIVE TO SEEK CHRIST</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to build the church with Christ. Christ is the unique material for the building of the church. However, in His sovereignty, God knew that His chosen people would not have an adequate desire to seek Christ. This is the actual situation among Christians today. Although many have received Christ as their Savior and are saved, they do not seek Christ. But because God&rsquo;s desire is to build the church with Christ, Christ must be wrought into our being. We need to be saturated and permeated with Christ in order to become a part of Christ. When we have been saturated, soaked, and permeated with Christ, we shall each be a part of Christ. When all these parts are put together, they constitute the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GAINING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Although there are millions of genuinely saved Christians, so many have gone no farther than receiving Christ as their Savior. They do not care about the subjective Christ, but leave Christ in the heavens as an objective Savior in whom they believe and whom they worship. They do not seek Christ, and they do not go on to attain unto Christ or to gain Christ.</p>
<p>This matter of gaining Christ is fully revealed in Philippians chapter three. In Philippians 3:8 the Apostle Paul said, &ldquo;Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may gain Christ&rdquo; (Gk.). Even Paul felt that he was void of Christ, short of Christ. Although he had experienced Christ to such a degree, he still said that he was stretching forth to gain more of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HUNGRY FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>I would ask you to consider how many Christians today are this intent in their seeking after Christ. How many Christians are hungry and thirsty for Christ? I doubt that among us there are very many who pursue Christ in this way. To tell you the truth, in recent days I have been asking myself how hungry I am for Christ. I have said to myself, &ldquo;Are you hungry for Christ? You have been in the ministry for more than forty-five years, and you have been in the church life for such a long time. Are you as hungry for Christ as the Apostle Paul was in Philippians 3?&rdquo; I must confess and say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me. I am not that hungry or that seeking.&rdquo; Philippians 3 reveals how hungry Paul was for Christ. In verses 10 and 11 he said, &ldquo;To know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death; if by any means I might attain unto the out-resurrection of the dead&rdquo; (Gk.). Here we see that Paul had a great hunger for Christ. How many Christians today are this hungry to gain Christ?</p>
<p>It is important that we realize who Christ is today. Christ is the Triune God processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to be the life-giving Spirit. Such a Spirit is here with us right now. Everything positive is included in this life-giving Spirit. Within Him there is redemption, forgiveness, justification, righteousness, holiness, life, light, and power. In the life-giving Spirit there is God, man, and every positive thing in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire is that we firstly receive Christ. When we do, we are redeemed, justified, reconciled, forgiven, washed, regenerated, and saved. After we have been saved, God wants us to hunger after Christ. We need to be able to say, &ldquo;Oh, I want to gain more Christ! I must be a person hungry for Christ that Christ may be my life supply and that I may be filled, saturated, permeated, and soaked with Him. Then I shall become a part of Christ.&rdquo; It is in this way that the church is built with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>The reason very few Christians are hungry for Christ is that the gospel of the kingdom has never been preached adequately. What we all have heard is only the gospel of grace, not the gospel of the kingdom. We all have heard the gospel of grace regarding eternal salvation. We have believed this gospel, and we have received eternal salvation. But perhaps we have never heard an adequate preaching of the gospel of the kingdom. Thus, we all, including me, need a serious warning.</p>
<p>In George Whitefield&rsquo;s biography we are told that one day when he was preaching on the subject of hell, someone in the congregation leaped into the aisle and began to shout that he was falling into hell. This indicates how prevailing was Whitefield&rsquo;s preaching about hell. Today we need some preachers to proclaim the punishment of the kingdom in just such a prevailing way. We need to warn the believers about being cast into outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. We need to preach the warning gospel of the kingdom to stir up the Christians regarding God&rsquo;s dispensational punishment. This type of preaching compels us to seek Christ.</p>
<p>A good evangelist always preaches the gospel from two angles. The first angle is to warn people that if they do not repent and believe in the Lord Jesus, they will be cast into hell to suffer the punishment of eternal fire. People need to be told of the judgment of the righteous God. The other angle is to tell people how Christ has done everything to save them and that they simply need to receive Him. The principle is the same in the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom. We need to warn all the Christians that one day Christ will come back to settle accounts with them. At that time they will be either rewarded or punished, either brought into the bright enjoyment with Christ or cast into outer darkness. Thousands of unbelievers and sinners have been compelled to believe out of the fear of going to hell. In like manner, Christians need to be compelled to seek Christ out of the fear of the coming judgment.</p>
<p>The promise of the kingdom reward is also a great incentive to seek Christ. The hope of receiving this reward encourages us to gain Him. When we are compelled to seek after Christ and encouraged to gain Christ, we shall be hungry for Christ. We shall earnestly desire to gain Christ that we may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.</p>
