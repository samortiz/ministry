   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 15 says, "Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We cannot imagine that any person would still murder after becoming a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible tells us that to hate one's brother is to murder.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person who has eternal life should never hate his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hating the brothers proves that there is no love in him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means that eternal life is not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's children can be in many different conditions, but they can never hate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there is a brother who is offensive in certain ways, we may not like him in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there is a brother who has committed a sin worthy of excommunication, we may deal with the matter with indignation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there is a brother who has done something extremely evil, we may ask him to come to us and rebuke him severely before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we can never hate our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a brother hates another brother, eternal life is not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every child of God has a life rich enough to love all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as a person belongs to the Lord, he deserves a believer's love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our love for any one brother should be the same as our love for all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The brotherly love that is applied toward one brother should be equally applicable to all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of love for the brothers makes no distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as one is a brother, he deserves this love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If anyone hates a brother, it proves that he does not have eternal life in him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does not have to hate all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as he hates one brother, it is enough to prove that he does not have brotherly love in him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The brotherly love that we are speaking about is a love that loves all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a very sobering thought.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a believer does not love his brother but hates him instead, or if he threatens or attacks his brother, we can say only, "May God be merciful to him!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here is a person who thinks that he is a believer and yet he is not saved at all!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as he hates a brother, it proves that he is not of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a serious matter!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Under normal circumstances, if a brother has done things which irritate you, you can exhort him and rebuke him, but you cannot hate him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he has done something which provokes you, you may be angry with him and rebuke him severely.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But there cannot be any hatred in you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if you "tell it to the church," according to Matthew 18, your intention should still be to gain him and restore him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you have no intention of restoring him and if your goal is only to attack him and tear him down, it proves that you are less than a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The brother spoken of in Matthew 18 told the church because he wanted to gain his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The whole issue is whether your goal is to tear down your brother or to gain him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is quite a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must not take it lightly!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning the fornicator in 1 Corinthians 5:13, Paul said, "Remove the evil man from among yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the beginning Paul delivered such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh in the name of the Lord Jesus and with the power of the Lord Jesus because the Corinthians did not do anything to cast him out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is this kind of dealing too severe?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was indeed extremely severe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But Paul did this so that the man's spirit would be saved in the day of the Lord v. 5 . The purpose for his flesh being destroyed in the present time was so that he would not suffer eternal loss.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The purpose of telling it "to the church" in Matthew 18 is for restoration; the removing in 1 Corinthians 5 is also for restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Joshua judged Achan, he said, "My son, give glory to Jehovah" Josh 7:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Though Achan had committed a great sin, he spoke to Achan with such a spirit and such brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>David took hold of his clothes and tore them when a young messenger brought the news of Saul's death to him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He mourned, wept, and fasted until the evening 2 Sam 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When someone told David about Absalom's death, David was much moved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He wept, saying, "O my son Absalom!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My son, my son Absalom!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If only I had died instead of you!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>18:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Saul was a king who hated David, and Absalom was David's rebellious son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet David wept when they died.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He had to fight the battles, and he had to judge, but he could not restrain his tears.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He had to judge, and he had to condemn, but he could not hold back his tears.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, if a person can only judge and condemn but has no tears or sadness, it proves that he does not know anything about brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If anyone rebukes a brother only for the purpose of tearing him down, such a one has no love in him, only hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To hate the brothers is to murder them!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a very serious matter!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A brother once wrote to J. N. Darby about the matter of excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Darby's first words were, "I think it is the most dreadful thing for a sinner whose sins have been forgiven to excommunicate another sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is nothing more dreadful than for a sinner whose sins are forgiven to excommunicate another sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Mr. Darby's reaction was something that issued from a life of love.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No doubt, there are many things which need to be addressed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can excommunicate a sinful brother or sister from the church if it becomes necessary to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But we must never harbor any hatred in dealing with them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First John 4:20-21 says, "If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And this commandment we have from Him, that he who loves God love his brother also."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Here John shows us that to love one's brothers is equal to loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should love our brothers if we want to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the commandment which we have received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must be careful not to do anything that will offend love.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not offend our brothers lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must love one another and must honor the brotherly love that has been placed in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should not put aside such a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God has placed this heart in us so that we can use it to serve and help the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should allow this brotherly love to grow, to be strengthened, and to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>First John 3:17 says, "But whoever has the livelihood of the world and sees that his brother has need and shuts up his affections from him, how does the love of God abide in him?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>John did not say, "How does the love of the brothers abide in him?"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He said, "How does the love of God abide in him?" because the love of God is the love of the brothers, and the love of the brothers is the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The love of God does not abide in a person who shuts up his love for his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He cannot deceive himself by saying, "Although I do not love my brother, I love God."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our relationship with the brothers comes from our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we are not related to the brothers, it means that we are not related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we reject our brothers, the love of God is not in us.</S>
