   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NEEDING TO BE SPIRITUAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: If our consecration is due to the church s arrangement, does this arrangement represent spiritual authority?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: This question must be approached from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For you to submit to the church s arrangement, the church must be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the church is in fellowship with the Lord, it will be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the church is not spiritual, the arrangement will obviously be questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a normal situation the church s arrangement should be the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time, the church should also follow in whatever way the Holy Spirit leads.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, the church s arrangement should be but a spiritual confirmation of whatever the Holy Spirit is doing in you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you accept this arrangement, you will be benefited.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, you should not care only for the church s arrangement without asking the Lord what His will is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before the Lord you must make a proper decision and have a living fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this fellowship you should have a feeling from the Lord and a decision from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in order to avoid making a mistake, it is best to have the confirmation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From another perspective, we always need to learn spiritual lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To accept the church s decision is certainly good; however, if your personal decision is not in accord with the church, yet you insist upon it, you have not learned the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>More specifically, you have not submitted to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To accept the church s leading is to submit yourself to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This will cause you to learn a valuable spiritual lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if the church s arrangement is wrong, as long as your heart is to submit to the Lord s authority, you will still learn a valuable lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The unique cause of our spiritual problems is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has established His authority in us so that we can lose our self and have no authority of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spiritual authority is for dealing with our self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What does the self refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the definition of the self?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The self refers mainly to our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matthew 16 reveals that the self is related mainly to our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord speaks of not setting the mind on the things of God but on the things of men v. 23 . Then He goes on to say, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself v. 24 . This shows that the self is in the expression of one s opinions, because to not set the mind on the things of God but on the things of men is to express oneself through the opinions in one s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order for you to progress, there is an authority in you that causes you to lose your opinions; it causes your self to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church s arrangement for you may be wrong, but the authority is right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more the arrangement is wrong, the greater the breaking of the self will be.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Generally, none of us has a problem submitting to the arrangement of a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when someone who is not spiritual makes the arrangement, we find ourselves unable to submit; our self comes out immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are able to submit even to a wrong arrangement, our self will be severely broken.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Question: Sometimes the feeling we have within is unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is it wrong to take the environment or the church as our confirmation?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Answer: Some people are very clear concerning what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both the feeling within and the leading without seem to indicate a yes ; the two are about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For some the yes may be very clear, but for others the yes may be very hazy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The end result, however, should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When one is unclear, it is right to give oneself to the environment or the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people are truly unclear and therefore can decide only according to what the environment or the church says.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you ask which kind of person is better, I would say that both are good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether or not you are clear, you should allow the environment and the church to determine your arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, your being unclear within is an indication that you are not strong enough before the Lord; this is why you do not know or understand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Under these circumstances, you have no alternative but to give yourself over to the church or the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, this is the right thing to do, but from the standpoint of your spiritual condition, this is not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should always learn to be in the Lord more.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>REGARDING WHETHER IT IS ALL RIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>FOR CHRISTIANS TO KILL ANIMALS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Question: There is a religion that teaches people to love all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is it all right for Christians to kill animals?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Answer: To not kill animals is a thought from Buddhism; it is a human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Strictly speaking, it is something from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before man s fall there were two things that were different from today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First, before man s fall God ordained that man would eat vegetables, not meat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Second, the other creatures did not harm man; in other words, there was no mutual killing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, from the time man fell and sin entered into the world, God told man to eat meat Gen 9:3 and kill animals as sacrifices 3:21; 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the same time, animals began to kill one another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, eating meat was something that came in after man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To eat meat signifies that man is fallen and needs redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If man had not fallen, there would be no need for him to eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It would suffice for man to eat only vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the Bible both meat and vegetables have a symbolic meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Meat denotes redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Redemption is a basic concept; it is a dispensational application that God has for fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Satan created a religion specifically to counter this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The people who follow this religion believe that not killing animals is a virtue, not knowing that this kind of teaching is used by Satan to contradict God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God says that, in principle, redemption requires the killing of animals, but Satan says that we should not kill animals.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The religion created by Satan teaches moral cultivation, which depends on works; therefore, this religion advocates vegetarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christians depend only on the blood of Christ for the forgiveness of sins Heb 9:22 ; based on this, Christians eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The satanic religion declares to God that man will not depend on the blood but will depend on works.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why Paul says in 1 Timothy 4 that the commandment to abstain from certain foods is the teaching of demons vv.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>1-5 , which is of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Eating only vegetables signifies man s dependence on his own works.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Religion discourages people from eating meat and encourages people to eat only vegetables; this is Satan s idea.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The universe is filled with symbols of Christ Col 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Thus, when the Lord Jesus ministered on the earth, He could use different things as figures of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Religious people do not know that the teaching of not killing animals is a teaching from Satan, and they even consider that to abstain from killing animals is a good deed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Actually, this is Satan s strategy to contradict God s principle of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In Shansi Province there was once a sister who was demon-possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Under no circumstance would she eat meat, but she was very zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>One day someone brought us a letter asking us to contact her.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We asked her why she did not eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>She said that she simply would not.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We told her that 1 Timothy says that abstinence from foods is the teaching of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>She had no way to dismiss this proof from the Bible, but she still would not eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>While she was abstaining from eating meat, we could sense that there were demons in her when we contacted her.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When we meet a person who prays frequently, we can sense the measure of spirituality in that person.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we contacted this vegetarian sister, we could detect an atmosphere of confusion and darkness around her.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If these two kinds of persons are praying in the same room, when we enter the room, we will sense a chaotic situation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>On one hand, we will sense a spiritual atmosphere, but on the other hand, we will sense a dark situation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When we go to a place where a group of spiritual people is meeting, we immediately sense the warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is not a psychological reaction; there is truly a spiritual element in this.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When everyone is meeting together in a room to pray and sing, we will feel warm the moment we enter.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Hence, we must realize that religious teaching to not kill animals or eat meat is from Hades and the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Question: What should our attitude be toward blood?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Answer: The Bible says that we should not drink any kind of blood Gen 9:4 except our Lord s blood John 6:53-55 because only the Lord s blood can save us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Blood is for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Drinking the Lord s blood signifies that we need redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only the blood of the Lord Jesus can redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The blood of animal sacrifices can only cover sins; it cannot take away sins Heb 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This commandment regarding not drinking blood is still in effect even in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Blood has a symbolic meaning, signifying that Christ is our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is a mistake to drink the blood of animals, thinking that any kind of blood can save us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The proper receiving of the blood is the drinking of the cup at the Lord s table meeting, which indicates that we acknowledge that only the Lord s blood can save us.</S>
