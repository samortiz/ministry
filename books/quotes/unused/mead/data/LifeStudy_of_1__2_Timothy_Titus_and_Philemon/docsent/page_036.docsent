   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>However, an apostle is not a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we read the New Testament carefully, we shall see that the elders are not appointed by anyone who is a dictator or who exercises autonomous authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the contrary, elders are appointed in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the saints in a particular locality meet together to worship God and to serve the Lord, it will be manifested that certain brothers have a greater degree of maturity than others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although no one will be fully mature, some will be comparatively mature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not even in Philippians 3 did Paul regard himself as matured in full.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because maturity is relative, the qualifications of an elder are not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, an elder's qualifications are comparative.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among all the saints in a local church, certain brothers, by comparison, are more qualified and mature than others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These brothers are manifested as such before the eyes of the church, and all the saints clearly realize that these are the ones who should be appointed elders.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This appointment does not come either by a vote of the congregation or by the exercise of autonomous authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, elders are selected according to the insight and foresight of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Based upon the saints' insight and foresight, the apostles then appoint certain ones to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The apostles minister the Word, bring others to the Lord's salvation, and edify them after they are saved; they also establish these believers as a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, they have the standing and the position to say that those who have been manifested as relatively more mature than others should be appointed elders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 20 Paul continues, "Those who sin reprove before all that the rest also may be in fear."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fact that apostles can rebuke elders who sin indicates that the apostles have authority over the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The expression "before all" refers to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A sinning elder should receive public reproof because of his public position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If an elder is reproved publicly, the rest of the elders will be "in fear."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 21 says, "I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels that you guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The elders in a local church are God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Dealing with them is a solemn thing before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the apostle solemnly charged Timothy before God, Christ, and the angels to do it in such a way that the chosen angels, the good angels with God's authority, may see that His authority is established and maintained among His redeemed people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul's use of the term "chosen angels" indicates that here he is dealing with administration, government, authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The book of Daniel indicates that the chosen angels are authorities, representatives of God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul deliberately uses the term "chosen angels" to indicate that here his instructions are related to administration, government, and authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul not only charged Timothy before God and Christ Jesus, but also charged him before the chosen angels.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul's charge to Timothy in verse 21 was to "guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To guard is to observe and keep.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prejudice refers to prejudgment, condemnation, before hearing the case, and partiality refers to inclination, favor, or bias.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words "without prejudice" imply without prejudgment to the credit of the accuser, whereas "doing nothing by way of partiality" implies no perverted favor to the accused elder.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, Timothy was not to take sides with those who made an accusation against an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To give them credit in a hasty way would be to show prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, Timothy was not to be partial, not to show perverted favor, to the elder against whom the accusation was made.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, in handling an accusation against an elder, three matters should be observed: first, there must be the word of two or three witnesses; second, there should be no prejudice; and third, nothing should be done by partiality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No credit should be given privately to the accusers, and there should not be any perverted favor toward the one accused.</S>
