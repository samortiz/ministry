   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Caring for Regulations instead of Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In their reading of the Bible, the majority of Christians do not see anything concerning the enjoyment of the Lord by feeding on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Instead, they see laws, regulations, ordinances, ceremonies, rituals, forms, and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, in his reading of Ephesians 5 a brother may pay attention to Paul's word about husbands loving their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, a sister may pay attention to the requirement that wives should be subject to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In both cases, Paul's word in this chapter is taken as a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The brother and the sister reading the book of Ephesians do not see anything concerning the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 5 all religious things are annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only are the things in the secular world annulled, but even all the things in the religious world are annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider chapter five and ask what religious thing has not been annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything, including the holy city, has been annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, according to this chapter, not even the holy Scriptures can give life apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's Desire That We Take Him as the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chapter six indicates that we need food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our unique need according to this chapter is for Christ as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After God created man, He particularly charged him to take care of his eating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Concerning man's eating, God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat" Gen 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord also gave man a strict command concerning his eating: "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it" Gen 2:16-17a .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's desire was that man would take Him as food, as signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Genesis 2:9 says, "And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>" After creating man, God was concerned for man's eating.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In particular, God's desire was that man would partake of Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>FIVE BARLEY LOAVES AND TWO FISHES</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter six of John we have the fulfillment of the eating of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this chapter the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people with five barley loaves and two fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In The All-inclusive Christ we point out that the significance of barley is different from that of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wheat signifies the incarnated Christ, and barley signifies the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The number five signifies responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the five barley loaves here signify the resurrected Christ who is able to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Barley, of course, is of the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In typology, the plant life is for generating, for producing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The two fishes are of the animal life and signify the redeeming aspect of Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The barley loaves of the plant life signify the generating aspect of Christ's life, and the fishes signify the redeeming aspect of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the generating life, Christ grew on the land, on the God-created earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the redeeming life, He lived in the sea, the Satan-corrupted earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to regenerate us, He grew on the God-created earth for producing life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in order to redeem us, He lived in the satanic and sinful world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as fish can live in salty water but are not salty, so Christ could live in the sinful world without being sinful and without being affected by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In His redeeming life, as typified by the two fishes, Christ lived a victorious life in the "death water" of the sinful world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is significant, therefore, that the Lord Jesus fed the people with barley loaves and fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that He fed them with the generating life and the redeeming life, the life that overcomes death.</S>
