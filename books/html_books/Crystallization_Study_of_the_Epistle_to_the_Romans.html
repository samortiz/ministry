<p>Prayer: Lord, we praise You that on this earth You have the recovery. Lord, in this recovery, You have been speaking to us throughout the years. We thank You for Your oracle. Lord, we thank You even the more that You are not only the Word but also the Spirit to us. You are the life-giving Spirit, the consummated Spirit, the Spirit who is with us and who is now right among us! We trust in You. We thank You for Your Word, and we praise You for Your Spirit. We look unto You that You would make the oneness with us so real. Speak with us and speak in our speaking. Be one spirit with us. We are nothing, we have nothing, and we do not seek anything. Lord, You are all in all to us. Strengthen us and sustain us. We praise You for all that You are. Amen.</p>
<p>In this series of messages, I have the burden to crystallize the book of Romans. Romans is a very common and popular book among Christians. I myself have expounded this book in congregations a number of times. Eventually, I had the Life-study on Romans in the first year of our annual trainings. That was exactly twenty years ago. Even though we did this, I still feel some things are hidden there, and these things are the intrinsic essence of God&rsquo;s divine revelation in the Epistle to the Romans.</p><h2 class="head1">I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Book of Romans<br />
Being on the Gospel of God</h2>
<p>The book of Romans is a book on the gospel of God (1:1). The entire book, from chapter one on the person of Jesus Christ the God-man and on the righteousness of God to chapter sixteen on the local churches as the expression of the Body of Christ, is the gospel, the good news and the glad tidings (Rom. 10:15), of God to men in its completeness. No other book presents us the gospel of God in such a complete way as Romans does. Do not think that only the first four chapters of Romans on justification by faith are the gospel of God. That is too shallow. You have to realize that every chapter in this book is a part of the gospel of God.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is first mentioned in the New Testament in Romans 12. It is not mentioned in the four Gospels or in the Acts. But Romans takes the lead to use this extraordinary term <em>the Body of Christ</em>. The last five chapters in Romans begin in chapter twelve with the Body of Christ and conclude in chapter sixteen with the local churches for the fellowship and communication of the Body of Christ. Do not think that the local churches are one distinct side, and the Body of Christ is another distinct side. These two sides are one entity. They refer to the same thing. The Body of Christ is unique in the universe, but it needs an expression on the earth. These expressions on the earth are the local churches. The local churches are the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is the local churches. This is like saying that Brother Lee is W. Lee, and W. Lee is Brother Lee. We must see that the Body of Christ is the very organism of the Triune God, and the local churches are the fellowship and the communication of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Now we need to consider what the center of the gospel of God is. When I was young, I was told that the book of Romans mainly speaks of justification by faith. In other words, the center of the book of Romans should be justification by faith. But actually, justification by faith is just an initial part of God&rsquo;s salvation. When a person first learns how to read, he learns the alphabet and then some simple words. Justification by faith is just like that. It is not high or deep. It is the initiation.</p>
<p>Then what is the center of the book of Romans, which is on the gospel of God? The center is a person, the most wonderful Person in the whole universe. He is an unlimited, all-inclusive, and all-extensive person. In Ephesians 1 we are told that this all-inclusive and extensive person fills all in all in the universe (v. 23). The measurement of the universe has no end. No one can tell how big the universe is or how many things are in it. But Ephesians 1:23 tells us that Christ is the One who fills all in all. Such a person is the center of the gospel of God. The gospel is concerning Jesus Christ the God-man; hence, Jesus Christ the God-man is the center of the good news and the glad tidings of God to men.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. <em>Crystallization,</em> in Our Usage,<br />
Being Based upon the Essence</h2>
<p>This center, Jesus Christ the God-man, is mainly of two aspects: His person and His work. The entire New Testament reveals to us Christ Jesus in these two aspects. This message is on the essence of the person of Jesus Christ the God-man. We may know a certain brother or sister, but do we know him or her essentially? If there is any person on this earth who knows a certain brother or sister, it would be their spouse. A piece of metal, for example, has an outward appearance, but within the appearance there is the inward element, and within the element is the essence. Now we want to see the essence of the person of Jesus Christ. <em>Crystallization,</em> in our usage, is based upon the essence.</p>
<p>I have spent over sixty years in studying the Bible. Romans was and still is my first favorite book in the Bible. After over sixty years of study, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, I can tell you that the Lord has shown me the essence of the person of Jesus Christ. To know the essence of an orange, you have to open the skin to see the contents. First, you can see the element, then within the element, there is the essence. It is the very essence of the orange that nourishes us.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is famous today on this earth. Everywhere nearly every person knows something about Jesus Christ. But who knows Jesus Christ&rsquo;s essence? Some have said that Jesus Christ is God becoming a man, so He is a God-man. This is good, but do we know the essence of this God-man? He first was God and now He is both God and man, so He is called the God-man. Over sixty years ago, I read a book which used the term <em>God-man</em>. That was very fresh to me. I was with the Brethren for a number of years, and I heard hundreds of messages from them. They told me that Jesus Christ is our God and that one day He became a man. But they never told me that this Jesus Christ, who is God become a man, is the God-man.</p>
<p>But now we need to ask, &ldquo;What is the essence of Christ being God? What is the essence of Christ being a man?&rdquo; Let us read Romans 1:3-4: &ldquo;Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; When I was young, I read through these verses again and again, but I could not understand them. I could realize something about the seed of David and the Son of God, but I did not know what the rest of these verses were about. I learned, bit by bit, year after year. Eventually, twenty years ago, I had a life-study on Romans in the winter training. I defined all the phrases and the terms in these verses. The Recovery Version is full of notes on these verses. But even if you read these verses with their accompanying notes a number of times, I am still concerned that you will not get anything. These two verses touch the essence of the person of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CENTER OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD&mdash;<br />
JESUS CHRIST THE GOD-MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Person of Jesus Christ the God-man</h2>
<p>The person of Christ is of two aspects. Christ as the God-man is both divine and human because He is both God and man. God is divine and man is human, so in this one person there is divinity and humanity. Divinity and humanity are mingled together as one person. We have to see these two aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Seed of David</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. In His Humanity</h2>
<p>Now let us consider Christ&rsquo;s humanity. In humanity, as a human person, He was the seed of David. David, the king of Israel, was one of the forefathers, ancestors, of Christ. In the Bible there is a genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1, which speaks of Christ as the son of Abraham and the son of David (v. 1). The son means the seed, and the seed is a son, so the seed of David refers to Christ&rsquo;s humanity (Matt. 22:42-45).</p>
<p>Christ as the seed of David is a human seed belonging to the old creation (the old man&mdash;Rom. 6:6) of God (Col. 1:15b). So in the essence of the person of Christ in His humanity, the first thing you have to remember is that Christ in His humanity was of the old creation, the old man. If I say that Christ is of the new creation, the new man, we will absolutely agree. But we need to see here that the essence of Christ is first that He belongs to the old creation. He is of the old man.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being a human seed belonging to the old creation implies His incarnation (John 1:14). Christ&rsquo;s incarnation brought Him down. He was the God of glory. But His incarnation brought Him down from His glory to be a man. He went down to the bottom to belong to the old man. He came in incarnation not to be a part of the new creation, but to be a part of the old creation of God. These are items of the essence of Christ&rsquo;s person.</p>
<p>In His humanity He was &ldquo;according to the flesh,&rdquo; &ldquo;the flesh of sin&rdquo; in its likeness but without sin (Rom. 8:3b). Christ was in the flesh, but His flesh was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin and was without sin. All these are the particular points of the essence of Christ&rsquo;s person.</p>
<p>The flesh is the framework (&ldquo;the body of His flesh&rdquo;&mdash; Col. 1:22) of Jesus Christ the God-man. Thus far, we have seen three items related to the essence of Christ&rsquo;s person in His humanity: Christ belonged to the old creation, so Christ in His flesh was an &ldquo;old man&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6), and Christ had the flesh without sin in it, but He was still in the likeness of the flesh of sin. Therefore, outwardly in the framework, the body of His flesh, Christ was not that excellent.</p>
<p>Both Satan and sin (the inward sin in our nature) are involved with this flesh (Heb. 2:14; John 3:14; Rom. 8:3b). Satan induced man to commit sin. By that he infused man with his sinful nature. Romans 7 tells us that sin dwells in our flesh (vv. 17-18). In our flesh there is something that is condemned by God, which is sin. Sin comes from Satan. It is the nature of Satan. Since sin is now in our flesh, and Satan is linked with sin, Satan and sin are involved with the flesh, even with the flesh of Christ indirectly.</p>
<p>There is also the involvement of the world in this flesh through Satan, the ruler of the world (John 12:31). The flesh of this seed of David is an old man of the old creation involved with Satan, sin, and the world. This seed is of the old creation. This seed is an old man. This seed has the flesh, and with this flesh, Satan, sin, and the world are all involved. Do you like to be such a person in the old creation, involved with Satan, sin, and the world? Anyhow, Jesus became such a person in the flesh, the seed of David.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. This Seed of David in His Humanity Being Sonized</h2>
<p>This seed of David in His humanity was sonized, was made (&ldquo;designated&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 1:4) the Son of God. Jesus in His humanity, in that part, was not the Son of God. He was of the old creation, the old man, having the flesh, which is involved with Satan, sin, and the world. So this part had to be made divine, to be sonized, designated, that it might become a part of the Son of God.</p>
<p>It is very hard to say what the word <em>designated</em> means in Romans 1:4. <em>Sonized</em> means to be made a son, but what is <em>designated?</em> Christ is a wonderful person. He has two parts: the man-part, the part of man, and the God-part, the part of God. The part of man is human. The part of God is divine. The human part is in the flesh, involved with the negative things, and the divine part is marvelous. How could this human part in such a flesh be made a part of the Son of God? It was in His resurrection that Christ made His humanity, divinity. His resurrection uplifted the humanity of Jesus into the level of divinity. Here is the essence of the person of Christ. This is very, very deep. Jesus&rsquo; divinity is the Spirit of holiness, having the divine power and the divine element to transform Jesus&rsquo; humanity, making it divine. This is what it means to designate, and this is to sonize.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Fulfillment of 2 Samuel 7:12-14</h2>
<p>This is the fulfillment of the prophecy in typology in 2 Samuel 7:12-14. In this fulfillment we have seen the essence of Christ&rsquo;s person as the seed of David in His humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Son of God</h2>
<p>The Son of God is the divine part of Christ. He was designated the Son of God in His humanity. He was the Son of Man in the flesh. How could He be the Son of God, so divine? It was by designation in resurrection.</p>
<p>This designation was in power according to the Spirit of holiness. The Spirit of holiness is the divinity (Rom. 9:5) in the seed of David&mdash;a man of humanity (Rom. 5:15, 17b, 19). Romans 9:5 shows us that Christ is God. As God He had divinity in Himself to be the seed of David, a man of humanity.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ as a man in the flesh was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead. The resurrection is the consummation of the processed Triune God. Resurrection is a person. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection&rdquo; (John 11:25a). The Triune God in eternity was just the Triune God, only divine. But He was processed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. Then He was consummated to be not only divine but also human. Now He has passed through all the processes of incarnation, human living, and death. In resurrection He became the consummated Triune God, who is resurrection itself.</p>
<p>Out of such a resurrection, which is the consummation of the processed Triune God, Jesus Christ as a man in the flesh was made the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). He is the Son of God, but now the Son of God is different from what the Son of God was before. When the Son of God was merely the only begotten Son of God, He had only divinity. But now He has His humanity, and His humanity has been made divine to become a part of Him as the Son of God. Now this Son of God is different. This Son of God is now the Firstborn of God.</p>
<p>An only son could never be the firstborn. Christ&rsquo;s being the firstborn Son indicates that many sons follow. These many sons are God&rsquo;s chosen people; the millions of them were all regenerated in the same resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3), in which Christ was made the Son of God in His humanity. In that big resurrection, which is the processed and consummated Triune God, the human part of Christ was made divine to be sonized. At the same time, all His believers were regenerated. These believers, of course, were also human. So in His resurrection, all these human believers were made divine through the regeneration to be the many sons of God. Thus, Christ became the firstborn Son of God with many brothers.</p>
<p>Christ was the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18) before His incarnation, having divinity only, without humanity. Jesus Christ became the firstborn Son of God in resurrection, with His God-created humanity uplifted, having both divinity and humanity. The regenerated believers, having both humanity and divinity, are to be conformed to the image of this firstborn Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Person of Jesus Christ the God-man<br />
Implying the Intention of God in His Gospel</h2>
<p>Thus, the person of Jesus Christ the God-man implies the intention of God in His gospel, that is, that He, as the unique God, wants to become a man that the fallen men redeemed by Him could become His many sons, made the same as God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

			<li>He, as the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit of life, indwells us in the heavenlies to give life to our mortal bodies (Rom. 8:2-16) to minister the divine life of the processed and consummated God into us, the dying ones (signified by &ldquo;mortal bodies&rdquo;), for the building up of the Body of Christ which will consummate in the New Jerusalem for the accomplishing of the eternal economy of God.</li>
			<li>He, as the pneumatic Christ, intercedes for us in our weakness with groanings within us in the heavenlies that we may grow in Him unto maturity to reach our sonship in full, which is the redemption of our body, the glorification of our entire being (Rom. 8:23-30).</li>
			<li>In the meantime, He, as the ascended Lord of all, as the consummated and ascended God-man and as the Head of the Body, intercedes at the right hand of God in the heavens for us that we, His many brothers and members, who are the many God-men, could overcome the oppositions and any kind of circumstances and be kept in union with Him in His unconditional love, so that we may be conformed to the image of Him, the firstborn Son of God, as the prototype, to be His consummated mass reproduction for the constitution of His corporate and organic Body (Rom. 8:29-39).</li>

</ol><p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your presence all the time. Lord, Your presence does prove that You are the Spirit. You are the Spirit, so You are present with us all the time. Your presence means everything to us in our life and in our work. Lord, we need You. We love You, dear Lord. You are so dear, so loving, and even, Lord, so sweet to us. Amen.</p>
<p>The Lord has brought us to the center of His gospel, and this center is Christ Himself. When we touch Christ, we have to realize that our Christ is mainly in two aspects: His person and His work. He is a wonderful, excellent person. He is also an all-inclusive person who is not so simple.</p>
<p>He is a person in two elements: the divine element and the human element. In the divine element He is God, possessing His marvelous divinity. We worship Him, admire Him, and adore Him for He is so divine. Then in His humanity He is a human being, but this human being is not that pleasant to us because in His humanity He belonged to the old creation. God&rsquo;s original creation became old. This implies that it became corrupted. When new clothing becomes worn-out and dirty, it becomes corrupted, that is, it becomes old. Christ became a part of the old creation, and spontaneously He became an old man. In His incarnation, was He something new in humanity? John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; That means God became flesh. Is <em>flesh</em> a positive term? It is altogether negative. Christ became an old man with the flesh.</p>
<p>In this flesh there are three involvements. First, this flesh is involved with Satan, the enemy of God. Satan is a poison, so this flesh is poisoned by Satan. Second, the flesh is involved with sin. Sin is a top evil in the whole universe; it is the evil nature of Satan. Sin is a poison which is contaminating and corrupting. Christ became flesh, which had been contaminated and corrupted with sin, but praise the Lord, He became flesh only in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3b). His being in the likeness of the flesh of sin is typified by the bronze serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness (John 3:14; Num. 21:4-9). That serpent became Israel&rsquo;s savior in life. A serpent is not a good thing. But that serpent, as a type of Christ, uplifted by Moses in the wilderness was only in the likeness of a serpent, not in its nature. This bronze serpent had no poison. Christ became the flesh only in its likeness, but within Him there was no sin. This must mean something. Why did God in Christ become flesh? The flesh is negative. But He became this flesh only in the likeness of the flesh of sin without the poison of sin. Later, we will see that He did this with a purpose.</p>
<p>The third involvement with the flesh is the world. God did not create the world. God created an earth. But Satan came in to systematize the entire earth, making it a cosmos, which we call the world. This cosmos is full of Satan&rsquo;s power and evils. It is the domain, the little monarchy, of Satan. The cosmos is Satan&rsquo;s kingdom which attracts and usurps people. So our flesh is attracted and usurped by the world. Such a flesh is poisoned by Satan, the enemy of God, contaminated and corrupted with sin, which is the nature of Satan, and also attracted and usurped by the world.</p>
<p>In this sense, Christ, as a man, being in the old creation, was an old man in its likeness with the flesh, which is involved with Satan, sin, and the world. He was such a person. This is what I call the crystallization of this part of the Word. This is uttered only by Paul with such a simple expression&mdash;the seed of David. What I have mentioned to you is a crystallization of this one term in Romans 1:3&mdash;the seed of David. Christ as God became the seed of David in His humanity. As such, He became a man of the old creation and was an old man with the flesh, which had been poisoned by Satan, corrupted with sin, and usurped by the world. These are all related to the man Jesus. God became such a person for the purpose of terminating all these things, to get rid of them for our redemption.</p>
<p>God would not, however, get rid of what He creates. God would still keep it by the way of redemption. God became such a man in order to terminate all the negative things on earth, even in the universe. But He would redeem that part which was created by Him. Thus, there is termination along with redemption. Now let us go on to see the essence of the work of Jesus Christ the God-man.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Work of Jesus Christ the God-man</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Preliminary Steps</h2>
<p>In doing anything, one must have some preparations. One cannot do things directly. There is the need of some preliminary steps.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. His Incarnation, Implied in<br />
His Becoming the Seed of David</h2>
<p>The first preliminary step for Christ&rsquo;s work was His incarnation. This is implied in His becoming the seed of David (Rom. 1:3; John 1:1, 14). The eternal God, the complete God (the Father, the Son, and the Spirit), came from eternity into time in the Triune God&rsquo;s divinity. Eternity has no beginning and no end. Suddenly, God inserted time into eternity, and time divides eternity into two parts&mdash;eternity in the past and eternity in the future. Christ as God once remained in eternity past. Then from that eternity past, He came out. Do not forget this happened only about two thousand years ago. To our understanding this was a sudden thing, but not to God&rsquo;s understanding. To God&rsquo;s understanding this was something planned by Him in His economy before the foundation of the world, in eternity past. We do not know how long He remained in eternity, but we do know that about two thousand years ago, He came out of eternity into time.</p>
<p>He came as God in the Triune God&rsquo;s divinity to be the flesh in its likeness but without sin (Rom. 8:3b). He partook of the human blood and flesh in which Satan with sin is involved (Heb. 2:14). This was to bring God into man, making God and man mingled as one person. Before His incarnation, God was there in heaven and men were here on the earth. But about two thousand years ago, to our understanding, there was a surprise. Suddenly God came with His divinity to be a man. He brought God into man. God was brought into the womb of Mary to be conceived there and remain there for nine months. Eventually, that conceiving became a birth to bring forth Jesus Christ, and this Jesus Christ is wonderful. He is both God and man. He was God conceived in a human womb, and after this conceiving He was born to be Jesus, the God-man. He is the God-man in the universe, as a model, a prototype, for the mass reproduction of many sons of God, for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy (1 Tim. 1:4b). This model, prototype, is a particular item in the universe which has never been seen in God&rsquo;s old creation. This item is the initiation of God&rsquo;s new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. His Human Living, Implied in His Being a Man<br />
Living on the Earth for Thirty-three and a Half Years</h2>
<p>After being born as a God-man, He needed to live as such a person. His human living is implied in His being a man living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years (Rom. 5:15, 17, 19). This was a living of obeying God (Rom. 5:19; Phil. 2:8; John 6:38). It was a living through death&mdash;dying to live (Rom. 5:19; Phil. 2:8; John 7:6, 8). It was also a living of righteousness before God (Rom. 5:18). His human living qualified Him to be the Redeemer of the unrighteous men (Rom. 3:23-24; 1 Pet. 3:18).</p>
<p>After the preliminary steps of His incarnation and human living, we come to the two sections of His work. The first section was in His earthly ministry. The second section is in His heavenly ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. In His Earthly Ministry</h2>
<p>After He walked through the preliminary steps of incarnation and human living, He began His earthly ministry. In His earthly ministry He did mainly two things. He consummated His all-inclusive death, and He carried out the life-imparting and new-creation-germinating resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Consummating the All-inclusive Death</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ the God-man died a wonderful, marvelous, excellent death. Adam died a death which he did not like, but Christ died a death which He volunteered to accomplish. This is His all-inclusive death.</p>
<p>He consummated this all-inclusive death through His death in His flesh, body (Col. 1:22). In His death He took away the sin of the world (John 1:29). Jesus died on the cross to bear the transgressions and iniquities of God&rsquo;s chosen people (Isa. 53:5-6). He died for the sins of the believers by bearing their sins (the outward sins in their conduct) on the cross (1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:24).</p>
<p>He condemned (the inward) sin (brought by Satan into man&rsquo;s flesh) in the flesh. Romans 8:3 says that sin was condemned in the flesh. This was for the believers&rsquo; redemption and justification (Rom. 3:23-26). Without such a death dealing with sin, we could not be redeemed. Even the more, we could not be justified. His all-inclusive death was also for the healing of the diseases of God&rsquo;s people (Isa. 53:4-5). The New Testament tells us we were healed because of His suffering of death (1 Pet. 2:24). By this death He accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal redemption to bring God&rsquo;s people back to God (Heb. 9:12).</p>
<p>By His all-inclusive death, He terminated the old creation signified by our old man (our natural man), including our flesh (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20a; 5:24). He also destroyed Satan, who is involved in our old and fallen man (Heb. 2:14; John 3:14; Matt. 16:23; John 6:70-71). He judged the world (the cosmos of Satan) and cast out Satan as the ruler of the world (John 12:31). His death was the death of the flesh, and this flesh is of the old creation, the old man. Within this flesh is Satan, the world, and sin. So by this one all-inclusive death He terminated all these things. He ended the old creation and cleared up all the negative things in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Carrying Out the Life-imparting and<br />
the New-creation-germinating Resurrection</h2>
<p>First, He did a work to accomplish His all-inclusive death to deal with all the negative things in the whole universe. Then He carried out the life-imparting and the new-creation-germinating resurrection. He accomplished a death and carried out a resurrection. The death is all-inclusive, and the resurrection is life-imparting and new-creation-germinating.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, as the one grain of wheat, released the divine life within Him from the shell of His humanity (John 12:24). His death was a termination of the old universe. Then His resurrection was a releasing of the divine life within Him. This is the life of God. When God became flesh, His life was contained in a shell of humanity. Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross broke that shell, destroyed that shell. Then the divine life which was concealed in that shell was released. Thus, His death was the termination of everything negative, and His resurrection was the release of the divine life from the shell.</p>
<p>In resurrection He, as the last Adam in His flesh, became (was transfigured&mdash;pneumatized&mdash;into) the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2; 1 Cor. 15:45). He, in His humanity (1 Cor. 15:45b), was born (designated in the power of His divinity&mdash;Rom. 1:4) to be the firstborn Son of God in resurrection (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:5-6). Christ has two parts: humanity and divinity. In humanity He died. Then in resurrection He, in His humanity, was born, that is, designated, sonized, in the power of His divinity, which is mentioned as the Spirit of holiness in Romans 1:4. The Spirit of holiness refers to the divinity of Christ. Christ was born, designated, sonized, in the power of His divinity to be the firstborn Son of God in resurrection.</p>
<p>He regenerated His believers in His resurrection with Him in one great, corporate birth to be the many sons of God and His many brothers (1 Pet. 1:3; Heb. 2:10-12; John 20:17), who, as the many sons of God, are to be conformed to the image of Him as the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). This great birth was not just the birth of one or even ten children. It was a great birth which delivered the firstborn Son of God and millions of sons of God. In a sense, if you allow me to say so, you have to realize that you are a twin with Christ, because He is your firstborn Brother. You were born with Him as His following brothers. We all were born, regenerated, in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection almost two thousand years ago. This is what we call our crystallization-study of the Bible.</p>
<p>The life-giving Spirit is the germinating factor of the Body of Christ as the new creation of God (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). Christ as the firstborn Son of God and as the Head is the element and the believers as His many brothers are the constituents for God&rsquo;s building (1 Cor. 3:9b)&mdash;the Body of Christ as the new creation of God consummating in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1-2). He is the element within us, the constituents, for God&rsquo;s building.</p><h2 class="head3">3. In His Heavenly Ministry</h2>
<p>Now we come to His heavenly ministry. Christ&rsquo;s ministry is first, on the earth and second, in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Indwelling Us in the Heavenlies<br />
to Give Life to Our Mortal Bodies</h2>
<p>In His heavenly ministry, He, as the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ, the Spirit of life, indwells us in the heavenlies to give life to our mortal bodies (Rom. 8:2-16) to minister the divine life of the processed and consummated God into us, the dying ones (signified by &ldquo;mortal bodies&rdquo;), for the building up of the Body of Christ which will consummate in the New Jerusalem for the accomplishing of the eternal economy of God. He indwells us in the heavenlies. This expression&mdash;<em>in the heavenlies</em>&mdash;is used by the apostle Paul in Ephesians (1:3, 20; 2:6; 3:10; 6:12). It refers to the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, and atmosphere. To be in the heavenlies is to be in the atmosphere of the heavens, the realm of the heavens, and with the heavens&rsquo; flavor, taste. We are in the United States, in the state of California, in the county of Orange, and in the city of Anaheim on Ball Road. But when we are singing, praising, and enjoying the Lord, we are in the heavenlies. We are neither in the heavens nor on the earth. We are in a kind of atmosphere just like that of the heavens, but not really in the heavens. We experience the flavor, taste, of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Interceding for Us in Our Weakness<br />
with Groanings within Us in the Heavenlies<br />
That We May Grow in Him unto Maturity</h2>
<p>In His heavenly ministry, He, as the pneumatic Christ, intercedes for us in our weakness with groanings within us in the heavenlies that we may grow in Him unto maturity to reach our sonship in full, which is the redemption of our body, the glorification of our entire being (Rom. 8:23-30). While He is indwelling us, He is ministering life to us and also interceding for us.</p>
<p>We do not realize exactly how Christ prays for us, but all the real seeking Christians are always groaning&mdash;&ldquo;O, Lord. O Lord.&rdquo; In the morning we may say, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy upon me. I know I have to be a vitalized member. I have to be an overcomer. I have to be one in Mount Zion. But You know my situation. I intended and decided to be such a person, but I failed. What shall I do, Lord?&rdquo; This is your groaning. Do you not groan in this way all the time? This kind of groaning is our groaning, but in our groaning is Christ&rsquo;s intercession. When you groan in this way for your failure, for your defeat, in your groaning is Christ&rsquo;s praying for you. Christ is interceding for us in our weakness through our groaning.</p>
<p>If you were stiff-necked and hardened in your heart, you would say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I want to be an overcomer, but I cannot do it, and I will never do it.&rdquo; This is not groaning. This is to be stubborn and hardened. But the ones who would receive mercy and grace would groan, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord, what shall I do, Lord? How can I overcome all these failures, Lord?&rdquo; In this is the indwelling Lord&rsquo;s prayer for you in your weakness. Even in the meetings we may groan by saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus. I don&rsquo;t know what to say, Lord. O Lord, what should I say? I have much to say, but I don&rsquo;t know how to start.&rdquo; When you groan, right away Christ intercedes for you. Then you will have something to say.</p>
<p>He is groaning within us in the heavenlies that we may grow in Him unto maturity. I have the faith that regardless of how many times we are defeated, one day we will reach the goal of maturity. This is because Christ Himself is interceding for us that we may grow unto maturity to reach our full sonship, which is the redemption of our body, the glorification of our entire being. All of these things are in Romans 8. The first section in Romans 8 is the pneumatic Christ indwelling us. The second section in Romans 8 is the pneumatic Christ interceding within us for us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Interceding at the Right Hand of God<br />
in the Heavens for Us That We Could Overcome<br />
the Oppositions and Any Kind of Circumstances and<br />
Be Kept in Union with Him in His Unconditional Love</h2>
<p>In the meantime, He, as the ascended Lord of all, as the consummated and ascended God-man and as the Head of the Body, intercedes at the right hand of God in the heavens for us that we, His many brothers and members, who are the many God-men, could overcome the oppositions and any kind of circumstances and be kept in union with Him in His unconditional love, so that we may be conformed to the image of Him, the firstborn Son of God, as the prototype, to be His consummated mass reproduction for the constitution of His corporate and organic Body (Rom. 8:29-39). Christ has different statuses. In the status of the pneumatic Christ, He intercedes within us in the heavenlies. In the status of the ascended Lord, He is interceding for us in the heavens, not in the heavenlies. He intercedes for us so that we may overcome everything in our surroundings. If God is for us, who can defeat us? According to Romans 8:29-39, nothing can defeat us, and we can overcome. These verses are the third section of Romans 8.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Accomplishments of Christ&rsquo;s<br />
Earthly and Heavenly Ministries</h2>
<p>Thus, His earthly ministry up to the end of His resurrection produced the many sons of God who are His many brothers as the constituents for the building up of His Body; and His heavenly ministry, from His ascension to His second coming, ministers the divine life to His members that they may grow unto maturity, unto the redemption of their body, the glorification of God&rsquo;s redeemed people, and keeps all His members in union with Him that they may be conformed to the image of Him as the prototype for the mass reproduction of Him for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. His earthly ministry prepared, and His heavenly ministry consummates. This is what I call the crystallization of the study of the Bible.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

<h1 class="title">An Additional Word concerning</h1>
<h1 class="title">the Essence of the Person and Work</h1>
<h1 class="title">of Jesus Christ the God-man</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:3-4</h1>
<p>I would like to present a very important sketch on the first two messages we have covered concerning the center of the gospel of God. This center is a person, Jesus Christ. He is a wonderful, all-inclusive, and all-extensive person with a marvelous work. With Christ&rsquo;s person there are two aspects: the aspect of His divinity and the aspect of His humanity. Since He is one person with two elements, He is God and man.</p>
<p>Throughout the past twenty centuries, Jewish scholars and Christian teachers have studied and argued about who died on the cross. Jewish scholars say that the One who died on the cross was merely a Nazarene who came from a despised city in the despised province of Galilee. Of course, they are short-sighted. Many Christians would say that it was Jesus Christ our Savior who died on the cross. This is correct, but it is far from a complete answer. The One who died on the cross has two elements. The divine element is God, and the human element is man. Thus, the One who died on the cross is a man and also is God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF DAVID IN HIS HUMANITY</h2>
<p>Being a man, a real man, a genuine man, Jesus Christ does have humanity, and this humanity was the flesh. The Word became flesh (John 1:14), not in a positive sense, but indirectly in a negative sense. This flesh, however, was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin, without the poison of sin (Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21a; Heb. 4:15). Still, we must realize that Christ became flesh. In His flesh He was an &ldquo;old man&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6). Thus, He belonged to the old creation (Col. 1:15b). The flesh had been poisoned by Satan, corrupted with sin, Satan&rsquo;s nature, and usurped by the world, Satan&rsquo;s cosmos. As such an all-inclusive person, Christ died on the cross. When He died on the cross, all six items&mdash;the old creation, the old man, the flesh, Satan, sin, and the world&mdash;were crucified on the cross. Thus, in the eyes of God, after Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, the entire universe has been cleared up.</p>
<p>Christ was dying on the cross as a human seed belonging to the old creation and as an old man. This old man includes you and me. Actually, we died with Christ on the cross nearly two thousand years ago, even though we were not yet born (Gal. 2:20a). We were there because we were in Adam (see Rom. 5:14, note 4). Many actually came to the United States a few centuries ago when their forefathers came, because they came in them (cf. Heb. 7:9-10 and note 9<sup>1</sup>). In the same way, we were also in Adam as the old man when he was being crucified on the cross (Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>Christ also died on the cross in the flesh. One thing in the whole universe that offends God to the uttermost is the flesh. The flesh is the embodiment of Satan. Satan and the flesh are one. Christ, of course, was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin, without the poison of sin and Satan, but because Christ died on the cross in the flesh, the flesh also died there.</p>
<p>Not only so, when Christ died, Satan was destroyed. Hebrews 2:14 tells us that Jesus partook of blood and flesh to die on the cross to destroy the devil. Three things are the most ugly things in the universe: the flesh, sin, and Satan. The flesh is the embodiment of Satan, and sin is the nature of Satan. This sin was condemned and terminated by the death of Christ. Romans 8:3 says that God sent His Son to condemn sin. The One who died on the cross also judged the world, the satanic cosmos, the evil system, which systematizes all the descendants of Adam. John 12:31 says that on the cross Christ would judge the world and cast out Satan, the ruler of this world.</p>
<p>Thus, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross as the seed of David in His humanity was with these six items: the old creation, the old man, the flesh, Satan, sin, and the world. This is why His death is the all-inclusive death. We should treasure such a message which unveils to us who Jesus Christ was. He was a man, but what kind of man was He? He was the seed of David. This seed was of the old creation and the old man. This seed had the flesh, which is involved with Satan, sin, and the world. So when Jesus Christ died on the cross, He brought all these items with Him to be crucified there. His all-inclusive death cleared up the entire universe.</p>
<p>Also, Christ&rsquo;s flesh, His humanity, was the incarnation of God, so when this humanity was dying on the cross, God was also there. Hebrews 9:14 shows that Christ did not die on the cross merely as a man. He also offered Himself to God by the eternal Spirit. The eternal Spirit was with Him and strengthened Him to die.</p>
<p>Colossians 2 tells us that when Christ was dying on the cross with God, Satan sent his evil angels to frustrate Him. So while Christ was dying on the cross, God was stripping off all these evil angels (v. 15). The human eyes saw only how the Roman soldiers put up the cross and nailed Christ on it. Peter, Mary, and the disciples saw only this physical view. They did not see that Satan had sent his evil angels to disturb Christ in His death and that God was stripping them off. With the crucifixion there was a physical view and a spiritual view. This is the all-inclusive death of the person Jesus Christ, as the seed of David.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD<br />
AND THE FIRSTBORN SON OF GOD</h2>
<p>Now we want to consider the element of Christ&rsquo;s divinity. Christ as God is divine, but it is difficult to understand the involvement of Christ&rsquo;s divinity. The divinity of Christ is involved with His being two kinds of Sons of God. First, as the divine One in His divinity, He is the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 1:18). Second, He is the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). As the only begotten Son of God, He is merely divine and is self-existing and ever-existing, eternal, without beginning or ending. But His being the firstborn Son of God involves much more because the firstborn Son of God is a composition of His divinity plus His humanity. His divinity is exactly the same as the divinity of the only begotten Son of God, but His humanity was added by His being incarnated. The only begotten Son of God with only divinity put on blood and flesh. This means that when He was incarnated, He put humanity upon His divinity. Then He became a God-man. From His incarnation to His death, He still was the only begotten Son, and this only begotten Son is the divine part of Christ as the God-man.</p>
<p>The cross killed His human part, but His divine part still lived and was very active. This part of divinity is called by Paul in Romans 1:4 the Spirit of holiness. In resurrection the divine part of Christ, as the Spirit of holiness, resurrected the killed human part of Christ by germinating it with the divine power. Thus, the killed humanity of Christ in resurrection was uplifted. This is what Paul means when he says that Jesus Christ as the seed of David was designated the Son of God. This designation was a kind of process.</p>
<p>In these many years, through a deep study of the Bible, the Lord has shown us the crystallization of this word <em>designate.</em> How was the seed of David designated to be the Son of God? This took place first by the seed of David as a man being put on the cross to be killed. Right away this God-man&rsquo;s divinity as the Spirit of holiness was a kind of power to resurrect His humanity by germinating His killed humanity with the divine element to raise it up, to uplift it. This is designation. In this designation Jesus Christ became the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>The humanity of Christ became divine in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Christ&rsquo;s divinity had the power to uplift His crucified humanity, to resurrect that humanity. When Paul said that Jesus Christ was designated the Son of God, this means that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection uplifted His humanity and put His divinity into this humanity. So by this resurrection, His humanity was born to be a part of the Son of God. This is why Acts 13:33 tells us that in resurrection, Christ as the Son of Man was born to be the Son of God. As the Son of God with humanity, He is the God-man. This composition of divinity and humanity becomes a God-man, and this God-man is a prototype to produce something.</p>
<p>In His resurrection, all His believers were born, regenerated, with Him as His millions of &ldquo;twins&rdquo; to make all these twins the same as He is (1 Pet. 1:3). These many twins are the reproduction of the prototype. The prototype is the firstborn Son of God, and the reproduction is the many sons of God. <em>The Firstborn</em> indicates that more sons are coming. If there were not more sons to follow, He would remain merely the Only Begotten. When Jesus as the Son of Man through death and resurrection was born to be the firstborn Son of God, the millions of God&rsquo;s chosen people were born in the same birth.</p>
<p>Now He is the God-man, with humanity mingled with divinity, including His death and His resurrection. He is such a prototype to produce millions of God-men. These millions of God-men are the mass reproduction who are exactly the same as the wonderful person Jesus Christ. This mass reproduction of the prototype becomes the members of the prototype to be His Body, the Body of Christ, and this Body of Christ consummates in the New Jerusalem, which is the corporate expression of the Triune God, processed and consummated in Christ and becoming the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>As the only begotten Son of God, in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In His divinity He was the Holy Spirit already. But in His resurrection He put the uplifted humanity into His divinity, and this One in resurrection became the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the very germinating power to germinate every part of the new creation of God. The new creation of God is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which is the unique expression of God&rsquo;s mingling Himself with man for eternity. This shows us the all-inclusive and all-extensive involvement of Christ&rsquo;s divinity in His wonderful person.</p>
<p>The life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God and the Consummator of the tripartite man as Christ&rsquo;s Body, which ultimately consummates in the New Jerusalem. By this we can see that the person of Christ involves the entire New Testament, from the first page of Matthew to the last page of Revelation. The first page of Matthew speaks of the genealogy of Christ (1:1-17), and the last page of Revelation speaks of the Spirit and the bride (22:17a). This is the consummation.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have seen the center of the gospel of God, we want to go on to see its content. The content of the gospel of God is the dynamic salvation of God in its fullness. In this message we want to see the essence of the particular items of God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE GOSPEL OF GOD BEING DYNAMIC (POWERFUL)<br />
TO SAVE ALL THE SINNERS WHO WOULD BELIEVE IN IT</h2>
<p>Romans 1:16 says that the gospel of God is powerful to save all men. The word <em>powerful</em> means dynamic. The Greek word comes from the noun <em>dynamo</em>. It refers to a kind of power like that of a nuclear bomb. The gospel of God is a dynamo to save people. The word <em>dynamo</em> implies an endless power.</p>
<p>Thus, the gospel of God is endlessly powerful (dynamic) to save all the sinners who would believe in it. Whoever believes, whether he is a Jew, a Gentile, a gentleman, or a bank robber, will be saved by this dynamic salvation. In John 4 there is a story of the Lord&rsquo;s encounter with a sinful Samaritan woman who had been married to five husbands and was living with someone who was not her husband. When she asked the Lord to give her the living water, He said, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (v. 16). Her husband was the center of her sin. To speak to Christ of her husbands was to confess her sins. But she confessed in a lying way by saying that she did not have a husband. The Lord responded, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). Even such a one as this Samaritan woman was saved by the powerful gospel in drinking the living water of Christ (v. 14).</p>
<p>In Luke 19 there is another story of the Lord&rsquo;s contact with a great sinner, Zaccheus, who was an evil chief tax collector (v. 2). He extorted the people by putting an excessive value on property or income, or increasing the tax of those unable to pay, and would then practice usury. The Lord paid a visit to his city purposely to meet him. Right after he received the Lord, he said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much&rdquo; (v. 8). This is the fast issue of the Lord&rsquo;s dynamic salvation. So the Lord said, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house&rdquo; (v. 9). This salvation was to save one of God&rsquo;s chosen people who fell into sin to such an extent that he extorted his own people by being a tax collector of the Roman imperialism, showing the powerful, dynamic, salvation, a salvation with an endless power.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To Redeem Them</h2>
<p>The gospel of God is powerful to redeem us. God&rsquo;s salvation is of two parts. The first part is redemption. The second part is the direct salvation. Redemption can be considered a part of God&rsquo;s salvation, because it is the initiation of God&rsquo;s salvation. Thus, redemption as the initiation becomes the foundation of God&rsquo;s salvation. First, God redeemed the sinners, and this was done judicially. The word <em>judicial</em> means &ldquo;to make lawful.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s redemption is judicial because the very sinners He saved are all sinful. Every one is condemned by God&rsquo;s righteousness, and every one, in a sense, has been sentenced by God to death, to perish, according to His righteous law. Thus, all the descendants of Adam, according to God&rsquo;s righteous and holy law, are condemned and sentenced. Now God wants to redeem these condemned and sentenced sinners. If God would just forgive us without a righteous procedure, He would become a lawless God. For Him to remain in His righteous and holy position, He has to do something to redeem the sinners judicially.</p>
<p>All proper Christians admit that they were redeemed by Christ&rsquo;s paying the price for them. Christ died and shed His blood for us. He died on the cross as our replacement. The Bible tells us that God decided to crucify Christ (Isa. 53:10). If Christ had not died as our replacement, then God would have become unrighteous in crucifying Christ, because Christ is the only person who is absolutely righteous and just. One of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns says, &ldquo;Amazing love! how can it be / That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #296). The just God-man died for the unjust sinners (1 Pet. 3:18), so His death is called the vicarious death. One just God-man died for many unjust sinners. Such a vicarious death is judicial. God redeemed us judicially by the blood of Christ. To redeem, in a sense, is to purchase. When you purchase something, you have to pay the price. God&rsquo;s redemption is a kind of purchase. God purchased us sinners judicially by paying Christ&rsquo;s blood as the price on the cross.</p>
<p>By reading the Gospels, we can see that Christ was hanging on the cross for six hours, from nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning until three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon (Mark 15:25; Matt. 27:45-46). These six hours are divided into two sections. In the first section, the Jews associated with the Roman soldiers killed Christ. Jesus was persecuted to death on the cross by both the Jews and the Romans for three hours. Then suddenly at noon darkness fell over all the land. That was an indication that God came in to deal with the dying Christ. That was God&rsquo;s judgment on Christ, because it was at that juncture, as Isaiah 53 says, that God put all man&rsquo;s sin upon Christ, considering Him as the unique sinner (vv. 4-6). The Lord Jesus told us in the Gospels that the Father God was always with Him (John 8:16, 29), but when Christ was hanging on the cross in the last three hours, He cried out, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; (Matt. 27:46). At that very juncture on the cross, when God put all man&rsquo;s sin upon Him, in God&rsquo;s eyes He was the unique sinner in replacement of all the sinners. Thus, God left Him economically. Then Christ asked, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; We have to answer, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, because of my sin.&rdquo; He was dying for us, carrying out a vicarious death for all mankind on the cross.</p>
<p>God redeemed us judicially by the blood of Christ (Rom. 3:24-25) on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24a) from our sins (Rev. 1:5b). These are the outward sins in our conduct. God also redeemed us from His righteous judgment, wrath, and condemnation (Rom. 2:5-6, 16; 3:19b; John 3:18b) and from eternal perdition in the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8; 22:15). To perish in the lake of fire is God&rsquo;s sentence to us. We have also been redeemed from the accusation of Satan, God&rsquo;s enemy (cf. Rev. 12:10-11).</p>
<p>We were redeemed through the forgiveness of sins (Eph. 1:7) and the washing of the believing sinners&rsquo; sins (Rev. 1:5b; 1 Cor. 6:11). To forgive is one thing, but the stain of sin is still there. So following the forgiving, we need the washing to take away the stain.</p>
<p>We were also redeemed by the blood of Christ through the reconciliation of the believing sinners to God from their enmity toward God (Rom. 5:10a). We sinners were God&rsquo;s enemies, and there was enmity between God and us. Christ&rsquo;s death reconciled us to God. This is the reconciliation through which God redeemed us.</p>
<p>We were redeemed through the justification of the believing sinners by God (Rom. 3:20-24) and the making of peace between the believing sinners and God (Rom. 5:1). Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, we have been forgiven, washed, reconciled, and justified, so peace has been made between God and us.</p>
<p>Finally, our redemption was through the sanctification of the believing sinners unto God positionally (Heb. 10:10, 14, 29b; 13:12a). In our position we have been sanctified unto God. God has accepted us as saints. This is why 1 Corinthians 1:2 refers to us as the called saints. We are the called saints through so many steps, starting from forgiveness to sanctification positionally. Our redemption is all-inclusive. Such a redemption lays the foundation of God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation for the consummation of God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. To Save Them</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is not only to redeem us but also to save us. God&rsquo;s redemption is judicial. God&rsquo;s salvation is organic. We were redeemed judicially by the blood of Christ, but we are saved organically by the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10b). We should not say that God saved us by His blood. God redeemed us by His blood. Also, we cannot say that God has redeemed us from our temper. Instead, God saves us from our temper, not by His blood but by His life. We sinners need judicial redemption by the blood of Christ and also the organic salvation by the life of Christ. Redemption was accomplished on the cross, but God&rsquo;s salvation is always carried out in the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation saves us from the indwelling sin (Rom. 7:17; 8:2). When I was initially saved, I was happy, but I found out that something within was still bothering me. That was the indwelling sin. Not only are we sinful in the sins in our conduct, but also we are constituted to be sinners in the sin that is in our nature. Romans 7 says clearly that this was Paul&rsquo;s experience. Paul was saved, but he still found that there was something he wanted to do but could not do. Rather, something which he hated he did. So he said, &ldquo;It is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me&rdquo; (Rom. 7:20). Our redemption from our sins is by the blood of Christ. Our salvation from the sin in our nature, the indwelling sin, is by the life of Christ. Romans 8:2 indicates that the law of the Spirit of life releases us from the indwelling sin.</p>
<p>We are also saved by the life of Christ from the condemnation due to the sinful action of the indwelling sin (Rom. 7:17-20; 8:1). On the one hand, we have been forgiven and there is no more condemnation. In a hymn Charles Wesley said, &ldquo;No condemnation now I dread; / Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #296). Even though this is true, day after day we are still condemned. A young brother may lose his temper at his mother. He hates this, confesses his sin, and asks for the Lord&rsquo;s and his mother&rsquo;s forgiveness. Then he determines that from then on he will never lose his temper at his mother again. But within a short time, he loses his temper again, so he has no peace and is full of condemnation. Actually, if you are really redeemed by God, you always have this inner condemnation. You may realize that a Christian should not joke so much, but you are a person who always jokes with people. After you tell a joke, you repent, but later you still joke with someone once again. To be saved from joking you need the constant salvation by the life of Christ. This is why you need to fellowship with Him all the time.</p>
<p>We also need to be saved in life from the old man (Rom. 6:6) and the natural I (Gal. 2:20a). With us it is always I&mdash;I first, I second, I third, and I last. One brother quarrels with another brother, saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know this is my shirt? Why do you put it on?&rdquo; This is the natural I.</p>
<p>We also need to be saved by the life of Christ from the self (Matt. 16:24). All these negative things are like gophers, mosquitoes, fleas, scorpions, and snakes. We need to be saved from the flesh with its passions and its lusts (Gal. 5:24). Passions and lusts are two categories of things. Negative desires are passions, and lusts are something worse. Worldliness is another thing from which we need to be saved (1 John 2:15-16; Rom. 12:2a). You do not need to be taught to be worldly. When you contact the world, right away you become worldly.</p>
<p>We also need to be saved from tribulations and all kinds of environmental troubles (Rom. 5:3; 8:35-39). Romans 8 tells us that nearly everything in our human life is a tribulation. A young brother may desire to have a wife, and surely to have a wife is a good thing. But when he gets a wife, this wife becomes a source of tribulation to him. The young sisters are anxious to get married. But when they get married, their husbands become a source of their tribulation. In a wedding meeting a pastor may ask the husband to promise before God that he will love his wife for his whole life. Then he may ask the wife to promise to submit herself to her husband for her whole life. Soon after the wedding, when they are going to sleep, the husband opens the window in the bedroom, but the wife cannot take this because she has always slept in a room with the windows closed. But without the window being opened, the husband cannot sleep. As a result, they quarrel. Thus, we can see that the husband and wife can be a source of tribulation to each other.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is a blessing to have children, but on the other hand, the more children you have, the more troubles you have. All our possessions become troubles to us. We need to have a house and a car, but these are also troubles. We need to have money to exist, but money becomes a trouble to us. Whatever you have is a trouble. John Nelson Darby said, &ldquo;O the joy of having nothing and being nothing, seeing nothing but a living Christ in glory, and being careful for nothing but His interests down here.&rdquo; It is wonderful to have nothing, be nothing, see nothing, and care for nothing but Christ&rsquo;s interest here on earth. Then you are really saved. Trouble comes to us from every direction, so we need God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Surely the young brothers and sisters have to get married at the proper time. They may think that it is better not to be married. Then I would say, &ldquo;If you have no wife or husband, you will have even more trouble.&rdquo; It is hard to find out which way is a debit and which way is a credit. Then what shall we do? To have or not to have are both a trouble. The only way out is God&rsquo;s salvation. We need to live a life of dying to our self all the time to be conformed to His death all the time (Phil. 3:10). This is God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>We need to be saved from spiritual death and weakness (Rom. 8:5, 7, 24-26; Rev. 3:1-2). If you never function in the meetings, you are dead spiritually. You need to be saved from this kind of death and weakness. Also, because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, the entire universe has become a vanity under the slavery of corruption (Rom. 8:20-21). Everything is subject to corruption. If you buy some clothing, it will eventually become old and corrupted. Everything in the universe is a vanity, and day by day everything is corrupting. But God&rsquo;s salvation by Christ as the life-giving Spirit saves us from these two negative things in the universe: the vanity and the slavery of corruption.</p>
<p>The salvation by the life of Christ is through our regeneration, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Regeneration washes the believers from the oldness of their old man (Titus 3:5a) and makes them the many sons of God (1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:3, 5; 1:12-13; Heb. 2:10). After regeneration the Spirit of Christ continues to remain in us and to work to sanctify us, to make us holy, not just in position but in disposition (Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16b; 1 Thes. 5:23). The blood of Christ separates us to make us sanctified positionally (Heb. 13:12). That belongs to God&rsquo;s redemption. But in God&rsquo;s salvation, we need to be sanctified, not by the blood of Christ, but by the indwelling Spirit of life.</p>
<p>We are also saved in life through renewing (Titus 3:5b; Rom. 12:2b). Every day we should be renewed by the Spirit. Then there is transformation to change the believers&rsquo; constitution metabolically with the divine element of the life of Christ into His image, the image of the firstborn Son of God, from glory to glory (Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 3:18). This is a big step and a lifelong process. Transformation is the infusion into us of God&rsquo;s new element to replace and discharge our old element.</p>
<p>This makes the believers boast in their tribulations (Rom. 5:3) and makes them more than conquerors over the environmental troubles (8:35-39). In all the troubles, we become conquerors. We will never be subdued, because we have the life of Christ and transformation is going on within us. This also makes the believers kings to reign in the eternal life through the abounding grace (5:17, 21) in this age, and also the co-kings with Christ to rule over the nations in the next age, in the thousand-year kingdom (Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<p>Our salvation in life continues through our conformation, conforming us to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God to be the mass reproduction of Jesus the God-man as the prototype for the building up of His organic Body (8:29). The last step of our salvation in life is glorification, which is the redemption of the believers&rsquo; body, to glorify the believers in their entire being with the divine glory for their full enjoyment of their divine sonship (vv. 23, 30). Such a salvation consummates the building up of the church, the organic Body of Christ (fully covered by Romans 12&mdash;16, after the parenthetical section of chapters 9&mdash;11), which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the center of the eternal economy of God. The first eight chapters of Romans are on God&rsquo;s redemption and salvation. The next three chapters are on God&rsquo;s selection. The last five chapters are on the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE WAY TO PARTAKE OF<br />
THE DYNAMIC SALVATION OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Believing in Your Heart That God<br />
Has Raised Jesus the Lord from the Dead</h2>
<p>You must believe that God has raised up Jesus Christ from the dead. If you believe in this way, you will be saved (Rom. 10:9b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Confessing with Your Mouth Jesus as Lord<br />
and Calling upon the Name of the Lord</h2>
<p>After believing, you have to call on the name of the Lord every day. This is your confession (Rom. 10:9a, 13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. To Be Baptized into Christ Jesus</h2>
<p>Finally, we need to be baptized into Christ Jesus, the embodiment of the Triune God (the Father, the Son, and the Spirit), to get into the organic union with the Triune God embodied in Christ (Rom. 6:3; Matt. 28:19). This is the way to partake of the dynamic salvation of God: to believe, to call, and to be baptized. God&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s salvation, and our believing are the three main items in God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

	<li>The salvation of God in the Gospel of John is of God&rsquo;s love as its source (John 3:16) and in Ephesians is by God&rsquo;s grace as its element (Eph. 2:5, 8), but in Romans it is by God&rsquo;s righteousness as its base (Rom. 1:17).</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s righteousness is the way of His acts (Psa. 103:6-7):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is related to God&rsquo;s laws, regulations, and principles; hence, it is a judicial matter.</li>
		<li>It indicates that the gospel of God is judicial according to the way of God&rsquo;s righteousness.</li>
		<li>It fulfills the requirements for God to execute His salvation.</li>
		<li>Hence, it is the key of the gospel of God being powerful (dynamic)&mdash;Rom. 1:16-17.</li>
		<li>Thus, it is revealed in the gospel of God as its foundation, solid and steadfast as the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne&mdash;Rom. 1:17; Psa. 89:14.</li>
		<li>Romans 3:24 says that God&rsquo;s justification is also by His grace freely:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God&rsquo;s justification by His righteousness in the judicial way is the procedure to fulfill God&rsquo;s righteous requirement that God could justify the sinners righteously.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s justification by His grace freely is the means for God to fulfill His purpose that He may give His life to His chosen people to make them like Him in His life and nature. So the book of Romans stresses further that God&rsquo;s grace is given freely to the New Testament believers unto life in reigning as kings like God (Rom. 5:17-18, 21). John 1:14-17 says that God&rsquo;s incarnation is to bring grace to men that men may become Him.</li>

	<li>The lawkeepers attempt to keep the law for the building up of their own righteousness (Rom. 9:31). But &ldquo;out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him [God]&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 3:20.</li>
	<li>Christ is the end of the law by fulfilling all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory, and is made judicially the righteousness from God to the believers&mdash;Rom. 10:4; 1 Cor. 1:30; Phil. 3:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>There are two aspects of Christ being righteousness from God to the believers:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The first aspect&mdash;to be the believers&rsquo; righteousness for them to be justified before God objectively at the time of their repenting unto God and believing into Christ&mdash; Rom. 3:24-26; Acts 13:39; Gal. 3:24b, 27.</li>
			<li>The second aspect&mdash;to be the believers&rsquo; righteousness lived out of them as the manifestation of God, who is the righteousness in Christ given to the believers for them to be justified by God subjectively&mdash; Rom. 4:25; 1 Pet. 2:24a; James 2:24; Matt. 5:20; Rev. 19:8.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>These two aspects are typified by the best robe and the fattened calf in Luke 15:22-23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The best robe typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness given to the believers to cover them outwardly before God as their objective righteousness.</li>
			<li>The fattened calf typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness given to the believers as their life supply for them to live out God in Christ as their subjective righteousness.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>These two aspects are also typified by the two garments of the queen in Psalm 45:13-14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">

<p>Prayer: O Lord Jesus, You are so dear and precious to us. We surely like to tell You that we love You. We love You to the uttermost. Nothing is so sweet in our heart as You are. Lord, we love You. How we praise You that Your presence has given us this meeting. We are so happy and full of rejoicing. This meeting is a rejoicing to us. We rejoice in it. We are in the heavenlies, in Your resurrection, in the pneumatic Christ, even the pneumatized Christ. We are in the processed and consummated Triune God. We are in the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. Hallelujah! Lord, we like to listen to You. Speak to us. Speak Your word to us with revelation, with enlightening. Cover us and shame Your enemy, Lord. We accuse him. Rebuke him for us, bind him, and destroy him. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>The crystallization in this message is concerning the essence of the righteousness of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Key Word concerning the Gospel of God<br />
in the Book of Romans</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen the center and the content of God&rsquo;s gospel, we want to see the structure of the gospel of God. All the parts of this structure are mentioned in Romans 1:17. Actually, Romans 1:17 is a verse that covers the entire book of Romans. It says, &ldquo;The righteous shall have life and live by faith.&rdquo; This is the key word concerning the gospel of God in the book of Romans. In this verse there are <em>righteousness,life,</em> and <em>faith.</em> Righteousness is of God, life is of Christ, and faith is of the believers. Faith does not belong to any of us as long as we are unbelieving sinners. Faith belongs to the believers. The gospel of God is built up with these three parts. Romans first shows us the righteousness of God judicially. Then it shows us the life of Christ organically. Third, it shows us the faith of the believers practically. According to the divine revelation as presented to us in the book of Romans, the structure of the gospel of God is of the righteousness of God, the life of Christ, and the faith of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Salvation of God in John,<br />
Ephesians, and Romans</h2>
<p>The salvation of God in the Gospel of John is of God&rsquo;s love as its source. John 3:16 says, &ldquo;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&rdquo; In eternity past, no doubt, there was a time when in God&rsquo;s heart, in God&rsquo;s love, He considered how to exercise His salvation. Love is the source of His salvation.</p>
<p>In Ephesians the salvation of God is by God&rsquo;s grace as its element (2:5, 8). Love and grace are not two separate things. They are two ends of one thing. The end in God&rsquo;s heart is love. The end that reaches us is grace. When love comes out to us, it is grace. When grace goes back to God, it is love. The source of God&rsquo;s salvation is love, but this salvation should be substantial, with some substance, and this substance is the element. Everything that exists has an element. A wooden stand is made of wood, so the element of the stand is wood. The element of God&rsquo;s salvation is grace. The highest definition of grace is that God becomes our enjoyment. Grace is God given to us for our enjoyment. Grace is strongly stressed in Ephesians, but in Romans God&rsquo;s salvation is by God&rsquo;s righteousness as its base (Rom. 1:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. God&rsquo;s Righteousness Being the Way of His Acts</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s righteousness is the way of His acts (Psa. 103:6-7). Love is God&rsquo;s heart; grace is God&rsquo;s element; and righteousness is God&rsquo;s way to act, to do things.</p>
<p>The righteousness of God is related to God&rsquo;s laws, regulations, and principles; hence, it is a judicial matter. The job of the law courts is to decide who is righteous and who is unrighteous, who is right and who is wrong. Their job is to make things right. This is a judicial matter.</p>
<p>The righteousness of God being the base of God&rsquo;s salvation indicates that the gospel of God is judicial according to the way of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Recently, a brother among us visited a scholar and theologian who said that his view of salvation is more organic than judicial. The words <em>organic</em> and <em>judicial</em> are very meaningful, and I have been enlightened by them. The book of Romans is on God&rsquo;s salvation by righteousness. This is something judicial. But the structure of God&rsquo;s gospel is also of the life of Christ. This is organic. Redemption by the blood of Christ is judicial. Salvation by the life of Christ is organic. Organic salvation by life is much higher and much more profound than judicial redemption by the blood. First, the book of Romans touches the judicial part of God&rsquo;s gospel by the blood of Christ. Then it goes on to present us the organic part of His gospel by the life of Christ.</p>
<p>The righteousness of God fulfills the requirements for God to execute His salvation. God is so righteous, so right; He never makes a mistake. But all the sinners are unrighteous, unjust, always making mistakes, and wrong in everything. You are wrong with your mother. You are wrong with your father. You are wrong with your brothers and sisters. You are wrong with your cousins. You are wrong with your in-laws. You are wrong with your professors. You are wrong with your classmates and roommates. Your hair, your shoes, and your necktie are all wrong in some way. With us, everything is wrong. God is absolutely right, and we are absolutely not right.</p>
<p>God and we are two extremes because He is righteous and we are unrighteous. God is on the &ldquo;North Pole&rdquo; and we are on the &ldquo;South Pole.&rdquo; How can the North Pole contact the South Pole? How can the righteous God do something for the unrighteous sinners? The only thing this righteous God can do for the unrighteous sinners according to His law is to condemn them and put them into the lake of fire. Whatever He does must be done lawfully. Then how can God execute His salvation for us? He does it by the way of righteousness. In God&rsquo;s salvation He fulfills all the requirements for Himself so that He can pass on His salvation to us. He made this matter absolutely lawful. This was judicial according to His righteous requirements. Hence, it is the key of the gospel of God being powerful, dynamic (Rom. 1:16-17). The gospel of God is powerful to save every one who believes, because it is based upon God&rsquo;s righteousness.</p>
<p>Thus, righteousness is revealed in the gospel of God as its foundation, solid and steadfast as the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne (Rom. 1:17; Psa. 89:14). This can be compared to the strong foundation of a great building. A solid foundation makes the building very stable. Righteousness is the strong, solid, and steadfast foundation of God&rsquo;s gospel. God may neglect other things, but He cannot neglect His righteousness. If He did, He would become a God who is not lawful. Psalm 89:14 says that God&rsquo;s righteousness is the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne. Thus, the foundation of the gospel of God is as solid and steadfast as the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne. No one can overthrow God&rsquo;s throne, not even God Himself.</p>
<p>Romans 3:24 says that God&rsquo;s justification is by His grace freely. We have seen that according to Romans 1:17 God&rsquo;s justification is by His righteousness, but why does Romans 3:24 say that God&rsquo;s justification is also by His grace? How can we reconcile these two verses? On the one hand, God&rsquo;s justification by His righteousness in the judicial way is the procedure to fulfill God&rsquo;s righteous requirement that God could justify the sinners righteously. On the other hand, God&rsquo;s justification by His grace freely is the means for God to fulfill His purpose.</p>
<p>God justified us according to His righteousness. This is judicial. Suppose God would not do this. A man may say, &ldquo;God, I need Your salvation. You have to save me according to Your righteousness.&rdquo; God could say, &ldquo;Dear man, who are you? I don&rsquo;t want to do that. I would not do it.&rdquo; But with God it is not like this. God willingly carried out His salvation by His righteousness. This is grace. Grace is out of love. So the Bible says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. This giving of His only begotten Son to us is grace. But the source is God&rsquo;s love. The motivation is God&rsquo;s love. When God gives His Son, that is God&rsquo;s grace, and when God does it, He must do it righteously. This is the procedure.</p>
<p>Thus, God justifying us, on the one hand, is according to His righteousness, and on the other hand, is by His free grace. The preparing of Christ as our propitiation is God&rsquo;s grace. If God said, &ldquo;I will not do it,&rdquo; no grace would be given, so nothing would happen. But God is willing to do it, and this willingness to do it is God&rsquo;s grace. Also, when God comes to do it, He does it righteously.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s justification by His grace freely is the means for God to fulfill His purpose that He may give His life to His chosen people to make them like Him in His life and nature. So the book of Romans stresses further that God&rsquo;s grace is given freely to the New Testament believers unto life in reigning as kings like God (Rom. 5:17-18, 21). In Romans 1 Paul&rsquo;s tone is in God&rsquo;s righteousness. Then after the first four chapters, in chapter five, Paul&rsquo;s tone changes, going forth from God&rsquo;s righteousness to God&rsquo;s grace. Romans 5:17 says, &ldquo;For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Verse 21 says, &ldquo;In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; Grace through righteousness reigns unto eternal life. So grace is the means, the element, and righteousness is the procedure.</p>
<p>John 1:14-17 says that God&rsquo;s incarnation is to bring grace to men that men may become Him, and this grace brought by God to us is God Himself for our enjoyment. <em>Hymns,</em> #497 speaks of the highest definition of grace:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Grace in its highest definition is<br />
God in the Son to be enjoyed by us;<br />
It is not only something done or giv&rsquo;n,<br />
But God Himself, our portion glorious.<br /><br /></li>
<li>God is incarnate in the flesh that we<br />
Him may receive, experience ourself;<br />
This is the grace which we receive of God,<br />
Which comes thru Christ and which is Christ <br />
 Himself.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Paul the Apostle counted all as dung,<br />
&rsquo;Twas only God in Christ he counted grace;<br />
&rsquo;Tis by this grace&mdash;the Lord experienced&mdash;<br />
That he surpassed the others in the race.<br /><br /></li>
<li>It is this grace&mdash;Christ as our inward strength&mdash;<br />
Which with His all-sufficiency doth fill;<br />
It is this grace which in our spirit is,<br />
There energizing, working out God&rsquo;s will.<br /><br /></li>
<li>This grace, which is the living Christ Himself,<br />
Is what we need and must experience;<br />
Lord, may we know this grace and by it live,<br />
Thyself increasingly as grace to sense.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grace is God Himself given to us. God gives Himself to us according to His righteousness, by His righteousness. Without God&rsquo;s righteousness, even if God is willing to give Himself to us as grace, He cannot do it because that is illegal, unlawful. But God has done everything to fulfill His righteous requirements by His righteousness. Now He is free to give Himself to us as our grace, as our enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Lawkeepers Attempting to Keep the Law<br />
for the Building Up of Their Own Righteousness</h2>
<p>The lawkeepers attempt to keep the law for the building up of their own righteousness (Rom. 9:31). But &ldquo;out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified&rdquo; before God (Rom. 3:20). To keep the law does not avail.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Christ Being the End of the Law</h2>
<p>Christ came to be the end of the law unto righteousness to us. It is by fulfilling all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory that He may be made judicially the righteousness from God to the believers (Rom. 10:4; 1 Cor. 1:30; Phil. 3:9). Christ&rsquo;s completing work ended the law, so He is the end of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Two Aspects of Christ Being Righteousness<br />
from God to the Believers</h2>
<p>There are two aspects of Christ being righteousness from God to the believers. The first aspect is that He is the believers&rsquo; righteousness for them to be justified before God objectively at the time of their repenting unto God and believing into Christ (Rom. 3:24-26; Acts 13:39; Gal. 3:24b, 27). The first stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #295 says, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Christ, who is my righteousness, / My beauty is, my glorious dress.&rdquo; Christ is our beauty given by God to us to be put on us as our clothing, our glorious dress. This is outward, objective.</p>
<p>The second aspect is that Christ is the believers&rsquo; righteousness lived out of them as the manifestation of God, who is the righteousness in Christ given to the believers for them to be justified by God subjectively (Rom. 4:25; 1 Pet. 2:24a; James 2:24; Matt. 5:20; Rev. 19:8). We were sinners who repented to God and believed into the Lord Jesus. Right away God gave Christ to us as a glorious dress to cover us, so we are acceptable to God righteously, outwardly. This is objective righteousness. Also, when Christ was given to us to be put on us, He entered into us to be our life and life supply to live Himself out of us. This living out is the manifestation of God in Christ. This is pleasant in the eyes of God. Surely, God would justify us subjectively, not just objectively. Now we can see the two aspects&mdash;outward and inward. Christ is put on us, and Christ enters into us to live God out of us to be our subjective righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Two Aspects of Christ as Righteousness<br />
Typified by the Best Robe and the Fattened Calf</h2>
<p>These two aspects are typified by the best robe and the fattened calf in Luke 15:22-23. The best robe typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness given to the believers to cover them outwardly before God as their objective righteousness. The fattened calf typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness given to the believers as their life supply for them to live out God in Christ as their subjective righteousness.</p>
<p>In Luke 15 when the prodigal son came back to the father, the father told his slaves to bring out the best robe and put it on his son. This robe replaced the rags (Isa. 64:6) of the returned prodigal. Surely the rags would not be pleasant to the father. But the father told the slaves to take the best robe and put it on his son as a new dress to cover him. Thus, he became a new man, but just outwardly.</p>
<p>Immediately following this, the father said, &ldquo;And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry&rdquo; (Luke 15:23). Even though the robe was put upon the prodigal son, he was still hungry. He could have said, &ldquo;Father, I need something to eat. I was eating the pigs&rsquo; food. I am starved to death. Father, I don&rsquo;t need this robe; I need something to eat.&rdquo; But the father could say, &ldquo;Son, if you are so poor, in rags, I cannot serve you anything. I must beautify you first by dressing you up. Then you match me. Then I can serve you with a pleasant meal, the fattened calf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fattened calf is also a type of Christ, just like the best robe. The best robe is a type of Christ being righteousness to us outwardly. The fattened calf typifies the subjective Christ entering into us to be enjoyed, digested, and assimilated by us to become our tissue, to become us. By eating the fattened calf, the prodigal son&rsquo;s face would be transformed. He came back with a pale face. But after eating the fattened calf, his face would become shining, bright, and colorful. This is Christ given by God to us as righteousness in two aspects: as the outward righteousness to beautify us and as the inward righteousness to supply us to live Himself out of us to be God&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Two Aspects of Christ as Righteousness<br />
Typified by the Two Garments of the Queen</h2>
<p>These two aspects of Christ as righteousness are also typified by the two garments of the queen in Psalm 45:13-14. Solomon had a queen, and that queen had two garments. The first one corresponds with the objective righteousness, which is for our justification. The other garment corresponds with the subjective righteousnesses (Rev. 19:8), which are for our victory. This garment is equivalent to the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

	</ol></li>
</ol><p> I would like to point out the first verse of <em>Hymns,</em> #483, which says:</p>
<p class="indent1">Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too;<br />
What is there left for me to do?<br />
Simply to cease from struggling and strife,<br />
Simply to walk in newness of life.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory be to God!</p>
<p>I like this hymn. It is one of the highest hymns in all the hymnals of Christianity. How wonderful and excellent it is that we have been buried with Christ! But burial is not the end. Following burial, there is resurrection. If burial were the end, that would be the death of Adam. Christ&rsquo;s death is not like this. He was buried and raised up, and we are in Him. Thus we have been buried and raised up with Him. Now the only thing left for us to do is simply to walk in newness of life. This stanza comes from Romans 6:4, which says, &ldquo;We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were crucified with Christ, buried with Christ, and raised up with Christ to simply walk in newness of life. A husband should not try to love his wife. He needs only to walk in newness of life. If he tries to love his wife, his loving will not last. His loving of his wife must be his walking in newness of life. In the same way, a wife should not try to submit herself to her husband. She should simply walk in newness of life. The newness of life in verse 4 is in contrast with the old man in verse 6. We were the old man, but today we are something new. We are God&rsquo;s new creation, the new man. Now what is there left for us to do? Simply to walk in newness of life.</p>
<p>In this message we come to the second element of the structure of the gospel of God. We have seen that the gospel of God is constructed with three elements. The first one is the righteousness of God; the second, the life of Christ; and the third, the faith of the believers. The righteousness of God is judicial, the life of Christ is organic, and the faith of the believers is practical.</p>
<p>The judicial righteousness of God has taken care of all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteous law. God&rsquo;s judicial righteousness brings God Himself in Christ to us as our life, and this is organic. Then the faith of the believers is needed, and this faith is practical. If the righteousness of God plus the life of Christ were without the faith of the believers, nothing would happen. The righteousness of God and the life of Christ to us need not our own faith, but the faith of the believers to make them practical.</p>
<p>Romans 5:17 says, &ldquo;For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This verse tells us that death reigns through Adam. But we need to be those who receive the abundance of two things: the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness. We have seen that righteousness has two aspects: objective and subjective. Here the righteousness is objective. The objective righteousness has been given to us as a gift. Also, Romans 3:24 says that we are justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. We believers have received two things in abundance: the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness. We have received the grace and the gift.</p>
<p>I would like us to be impressed with note 2 on Romans 5:17 in the Recovery Version. This note is one of the many nuggets and diamonds buried in the Recovery Version. It says:</p>
<p>The gift of righteousness erases judgment. Judgment comes from sin, but righteousness comes from grace. Righteousness always accompanies grace and is its result. Subjective righteousness (4:25b) comes from grace (vv. 17, 19), and grace comes from objective righteousness (vv. 1-2).</p>
<p>When I wrote this note, I spent much time to get the word <em>erase</em>. Objective righteousness is Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness given to us to be our righteousness, and this righteousness erases God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on us, the sinners. Adam brought judgment to us through sin. Christ as righteousness erases this judgment. Judgment comes from sin, but righteousness comes from grace. Grace is also Christ. It is God in the Son to be enjoyed by us. Objective righteousness issues in grace, and grace issues in subjective righteousness. Eventually, all three&mdash;objective righteousness, grace, and subjective righteousness&mdash;are Christ Himself. Objective righteousness is Christ given to us, grace is Christ enjoyed by us, and subjective righteousness is Christ lived out of us.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE LIFE OF CHRIST</h2>

<p>Romans 5:10 says, &ldquo;For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.&rdquo; This is a key word of the book of Romans concerning God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation. Being reconciled to God through the death of His Son is by the judicial redemption of Christ. If we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, will we be edified, taught, or perfected? No&mdash;much more we will be saved, not saved in the knowledge of the Bible, but saved in His life. Two crucial things are mentioned in this verse: the death of Christ and His life. We were reconciled through the death of Christ judicially. Now we are to be saved in the life of Christ organically.</p>
<p>We should not say that the death of Christ saves us. If we say this, we have not gotten into the crystallization of Romans 5:10. Christ&rsquo;s death, at the most, redeems us, reconciles us to God. Reconciliation is a part of the complete, eternal redemption of God judicially. After that we need something organic in God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation, and this organic thing is the saving in the life of Christ. Saving is an organic matter.</p>
<p>Now I would like to point out eight major and crucial verses which use the word <em>life</em> in the book of Romans. Romans 5:10 tells us that we are to be saved in the life of Christ. Verse 17 says that those who receive the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness will reign in life. And verse 18 says, &ldquo;Through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.&rdquo; Then verse 21 says, &ldquo;In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; The righteousness here is objective righteousness. Objective righteousness is judicially given to us. But subjective righteousness is organically lived out of us. Here it says that the grace given to us will reign, not in, but unto eternal life. These are the four crucial usages of the word <em>life</em> in Romans 5.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy the infinite grace of God provides initially the believers in Christ with God&rsquo;s free justification (Rom. 3:24), and this free justification of God is of life for the believers to have life (5:18). Then the abounding grace of God in its fullness (John 1:16) further affords the believers the capacity:</p>
<p>1) To reign in this age over the tribulations (Rom. 5:2-3a), the law of the indwelling sin (8:2; 7:17, 20), the usurping Satan (16:20), the charming ages of Satan&rsquo;s world (12:2; John 12:21), and the environmental troubles with the opponents of the believers (Rom. 8:31-39).</p>
<p>2) To rule in the coming age with Christ as His co-kings over the nations for one thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<p>3) To reign over the restored nations (Rev. 21:24) in eternity (22:1-5) in the new heaven and new earth (21:1) unto the eternal life (Rom. 5:21) in the fullest enjoyment of the divine life in Christ in the divine administration as the top divine blessing in the entire universe.</p>
<p>There are three more crucial verses in chapter eight which speak of life. They are verses 2, 6, and 11. Verse 2 speaks of the law of the Spirit of life. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; The Spirit of life as a law releases us from the bondage of the law of sin and death, and if we set our mind on the spirit, we will receive life and peace. Then verse 11 says, &ldquo;And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; <em>Mortal</em> means dying. This means that we are dying ones. Christ as the indwelling Spirit will give life to us in our dying body.</p>
<p>Now we want to point out verse 4 of Romans 6: &ldquo;We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.&rdquo; If we walk in newness of life, the Spirit of life as a law will release us, set us free, from the law, the bondage, of sin and death. Then we will also enjoy this life with peace. Such a life will then be continually given to us by being dispensed into all the parts of our being through the indwelling Spirit. The eight verses mentioned above are so rich that each one needs a conference. I would encourage you to memorize them so that you are able to recite them.</p>
<p>Romans 5:10 unveils to us that the full salvation of God is of two sections.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Section of Foundation</h2>
<p>The first is the section of foundation by the redemption of Christ judicially as the initiation of God&rsquo;s salvation. Of course, any foundation of a building is an initiation, but a building does not stop with its foundation. The foundation is the base and indicates that more building work is required. When we built the meeting hall in Anaheim, we were happy when the foundation was laid, but this also caused us much anxiety because we were wondering how we would complete the rest of the building. We realized that there was much work left to consummate the building.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Section of Consummation</h2>
<p>The second section of God&rsquo;s full salvation is the section of consummation by the life of Christ organically as the completion of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Accomplishments by the Life of Christ<br />
in God&rsquo;s Dynamic Salvation</h2>
<p>Now we want to see what the life of Christ, as the continuation of God&rsquo;s building, has accomplished for us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Giving the Believing Sinners Life</h2>
<p>First, it gives the believing sinners life, who have been justified by God in Christ as the righteousness from God to them that they may live in this life before God (Rom. 1:17).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Making the God-justified Believers<br />
the Many Sons of God</h2>
<p>Also, this life makes the God-justified believers the many sons of God (Rom. 8:14; Heb. 2:10), who are the many brothers of Christ (Rom. 8:29) through regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3) by the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) with Christ&rsquo;s producing and multiplying life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Imparting Life to the Dying Believers</h2>
<p>This life is imparted into the dying believers that they may grow in Christ out of death unto maturity (Rom. 8:11). Our regeneration transpired in our spirit. But we have another part of our being which is dying, that is, our mortal body. We need the life of Christ to be dispensed into this dying part.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Moving in Us by the Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>The indwelling Christ moves in the believers by the Spirit of life that they may enjoy Christ&rsquo;s life with its peace (Rom. 8:5-6). People who gamble set their mind on gambling, but our mind is set on the spirit. We can set our mind on the spirit because the indwelling pneumatic Christ is moving in us. The result is that we have Christ&rsquo;s life with peace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Sanctifying Us</h2>
<p>Another accomplishment of the life of Christ in God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation is that it sanctifies us (Rom. 6:19-20) with the holy nature of God as the holy element.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Renewing Us</h2>
<p>This life renews us, by the Spirit of life, based upon the washing of regeneration, from the old element of our old man into the new constitution of our new man (Rom. 12:2b; Titus 3:5).</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Transforming Us</h2>
<p>It also transforms us metabolically by the Spirit of life with the element of Christ&rsquo;s divine life, from our old constitution to our new constitution, for the building up of Christ&rsquo;s organic Body (Rom. 12:2b, 5; 2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Conforming Us</h2>
<p>This life goes on to conform us to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God that we may be the full-grown God-men for the Triune God&rsquo;s expression (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. Glorifying Us</h2>
<p>Such a life glorifies us through the redemption of our body that we may enter into the freedom of glory and our full sonship (Rom. 8:21, 23, 30). Although we are sons of God, many times we are weak because of our mortal body. But one day our body will be glorified and redeemed. We will be the glorious sons of God, who can soar like an eagle. Isaiah 40:31 says, &ldquo;Yet those who wait on Jehovah will renew their strength; / They will mount up with wings like eagles.&rdquo; In the coming age, when our bodies are redeemed, we will be able to fly like the transcendent, soaring birds.</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. Making Us Reign as Kings</h2>
<p>The life of Christ in which we are saved also makes us reign as kings mainly over the negative things such as Satan, sin, the world, the flesh, etc.</p>
<h2 class="head3">11. The Above Ten Items Being<br />
for the Producing and Building Up<br />
of the Organic Body of Christ</h2>
<p>All the above ten items are for the producing and the building up of the organic Body of Christ expressed as the local churches; this is covered in the last five chapters of the book of Romans.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

<p>I treasure this gathering, because for years I have been expecting to have this kind of meeting so that I could release all the depths of the holy Word, the essence of every critical point in the holy Word. For many years the Lord has not prepared the environment with the proper people for this kind of gathering until today. I am so happy. This is after speaking to the saints in the United States for thirty-two years. Through all of these messages, the Lord has shown us the depths of the holy Word in all its critical points.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE FAITH OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Now we come to the third element of the structure of the gospel of God&mdash;the faith of the believers. I use the phrase <em>the faith of the believers</em> because the unbelieving sinners do not have faith. In ourselves and by ourselves, we do not have faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Word <em>Faith</em> Bearing Two Denotations</h2>
<p>The word <em>faith</em> bears two denotations. The first denotation refers to the things the believers believe in; it is the objective faith (Eph. 4:13; 1 Tim. 1:19b; 2 Tim. 4:7). The second denotation refers to the believing action of the believers; this is the subjective faith (Gal. 2:20). Christ is the object of our faith. Here the faith is objective. Then we believe in the Lord. This believing is a subjective action, our acting faith in the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Faith of the Believers Being<br />
Christ Entering into Them to Be Their Faith</h2>
<p>The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith (Rom. 3:22 and note 1; Gal. 2:16 and note 1). Now we need to consider how and when Christ entered into us to be our faith. When we repented unto God, the pneumatic Christ as the sanctifying Spirit of God (1 Pet. 1:2a) moved within us to be our faith by which we believed on the Lord Jesus (Acts 16:31). Romans 10:17 says, &ldquo;So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.&rdquo; As sinners we did not have faith. Faith came into us by our hearing the word. This word is just Christ Himself.</p>
<p>When we heard the gospel, the preacher described Christ to us. The more we heard, the more we saw Christ and were attracted to Christ. As an illustration of this, we can say that a male falls in love with a female by seeing her. The more he sees her, the more he loves her. Her being so charming produces his love for her. Actually, that is not his love but her attraction. The preachers preach Christ to present Christ&rsquo;s beauty. After hearing such a word about Christ, that is, after seeing such a Christ, within you there is an appreciation of Christ, and your appreciation of Him is the reaction to His attraction. We can believe in the Lord Jesus because we hear about Him, that is, we see Him. We read the Bible, and in the Bible we see something about Him.</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity, it would be very good to preach the gospel according to this crystallization of Romans. Tell people about Christ in His divinity and humanity, in His being the only begotten Son of God and the firstborn Son of God. Many logical and thoughtful people would be attracted to such a wonderful person in the universe. Try in your vital group to go out to touch people by presenting Christ in the way that you have heard in these messages. After seeing, that is, after knowing, such a Christ, who would not believe in Him? Faith comes from hearing, hearing equals seeing, and seeing equals knowing Christ. Faith comes from hearing, and hearing is from the word of Christ.</p>
<p>When the proper preaching of the gospel is going on, the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, accompanies that preaching. That preaching speaks Christ outside of you, but the pneumatic Christ right away accompanies that preaching and works within you. Then you repent and appreciate such a One. Spontaneously something within you rises up. This is your faith, your believing. Your believing comes from your knowing of Christ. Your believing actually is your appreciation of Christ as a reaction to His attraction. Only the believers, not the sinners, have this kind of reaction.</p>
<p>If you see this point, you will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, even my believing in You is You Yourself. You are so attractive and beauteous! Who can help but believe in You?&rdquo; Many young people have been attracted by the Savior&rsquo;s beauty. Even if their parents persecute them and threaten them to death, they will not give up their faith in Christ. This kind of faith is Christ Himself. By such a faith the believing ones believe that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead that they may be saved (Rom. 10:9b-10a; 5:1). They have access through faith into the grace in which they now stand (Rom. 5:2).</p>
<p>The end of Romans 9 tells us that the lawkeepers are trying to build up their own righteousness by their work to keep the law. Paul said that this is wrong because they do not do this by faith in Christ (vv. 30-33). Then the beginning of chapter ten says, &ldquo;For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes&rdquo; (v. 4). Not many people have ever heard a gospel telling them that Christ is the end of everything. Christ terminated the law. He is the end of the law that He may become your righteousness. The first four chapters of Romans cover justification judicially. Then chapters five to eight are on Christ as life organically. Then chapter ten is on the faith of the believers practically. This faith can be ours by Christ being the end of the law that we may be justified. This means that He is the end of the law unto, resulting in, righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Eventually, All Three, the Righteousness of<br />
God, the Life of Christ, and the Faith of<br />
the Believers, Becoming the All-inclusive Christ</h2>
<p>Eventually, all three, the righteousness of God, the life of Christ, and the faith of the believers, become the all-inclusive Christ. Hence, this all-inclusive Christ is not only the center but also the structure of the dynamic salvation of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Importance of Faith</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Without Faith It Being Impossible to Please God</h2>
<p>Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith it is impossible to please God. This is a very strong word in the whole universe. To please God is to make God happy. Without faith it is impossible for you and me to make God happy. God could not and would not be happy with anyone without faith. This shows us the importance of faith.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, we are the believers. The name <em>Christian</em> is used in the New Testament only three times (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Pet. 4:16). But we are referred to repeatedly as believers in the New Testament. Galatians 6:10 says that we are the household of the faith, that is, the household of believers. The name <em>Christian</em> in its original usage was actually a nickname, not a proper name. Acts 11:26 says, &ldquo;The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.&rdquo; The disciples were given such a nickname, a term of reproach, in Antioch. So in this sense, the name <em>Christian</em> is not a good name. If I come here to speak to you by addressing you as Christians, I would be like a Gentile professor giving you a lecture. But if I address you as believers, this makes a difference. <em>Believers</em> is a sweet title.</p>
<p>First Peter 4:16 uses the title <em>Christian,</em> saying, &ldquo;But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.&rdquo; Note 16<sup>1</sup> in the Recovery Version says:</p>
<p class="indent1">Gk. <em>Christianos,</em> a word formed from Latin. The ending <em>ianos,</em> denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire. One who worshipped the emperor, the Caesar, or <em>Kaisar</em> , was called <em>Kaisarianos,</em> which means <em>an adherent of Kaisar</em> , a person who belongs to Kaisar. When people believed in Christ and became His followers, some in the Empire came to consider Christ a rival of their <em>Kaisar</em>. Then, at Antioch (Acts 11:26) they began to call the followers of Christ <em>Christianoi</em> (Christians), adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach. Hence, this verse says, &ldquo;As a Christian, let him not be ashamed&rdquo;; that is, if any believer suffers at the hands of the persecutors who contemptuously call him a Christian, he should not feel ashamed but should glorify God in this name.</p>
<p>We should not prefer to call ourselves Christians. Instead, we are bonafide believers of Christ. The name <em>Christian</em> is not related to faith. But the title <em>the believers</em> is related to faith. Without this faith, we can never please God. The only thing that can make our God happy every day is to believe in Him, to have faith.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. He Who Comes Forward to God<br />
Must Believe That God Is</h2>
<p>He who comes forward to God must believe that God is (Heb. 11:6b). This is very simple. God requires you only to believe that He is. The verb <em>to be</em> is actually the divine title of our Triune God. In Exodus 3 Moses asked God what His name was. God answered that His name is I Am That I Am (vv. 13-14). Our God&rsquo;s name is the verb <em>to be.</em> He is &ldquo;I Am That I Am.&rdquo; He is the only One.</p>
<p>Thus, when Jesus came, He declared that He was the I Am three times in John 8. He told the unbelieving Pharisees, &ldquo;Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins&rdquo; (v. 24). He also said, &ldquo;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am&rdquo; (v. 28). At the end of the chapter, the Jews said to Him, &ldquo;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&rdquo; (v. 57). Jesus responded, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am&rdquo; (v. 58). According to grammar, this is the wrong tense. The Lord should have said, &ldquo;Before Abraham came into being, I was.&rdquo; But the Lord said that He is the I Am, indicating that He is the very Jehovah. This is why Paul said in Hebrews 11:6, &ldquo;He who comes forward to God must believe that He is.&rdquo; God is always, eternally, in the present tense.</p>
<p>Revelation 1:4 and 5 say, &ldquo;John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.&rdquo; In these verses we see the Three of the Divine Trinity. God the Father is called by John in Revelation 1:4 <em>Him who is and who was and who is coming.</em> The One who is coming is the One who will be. This means that in the whole universe, nothing else is. Only One is. He is, because He is real. All other things created by Him are not real. This is why Solomon, the wise king, said that all things are vanity (Eccl. 1:2). You think you are, but you are vanity. Everything is vanity. The sun, the moon, the living creatures, the heavens, and the earth are all vanities. Only One is. This &ldquo;Is,&rdquo; the verb <em>to be,</em> implies existing. He is the One who was existing, who is existing, and who is to be existing. No human language can adequately express what this title <em>I Am</em> means.</p>
<p>Paul said that he who comes forward to God must believe that God is. The Chinese version says that when you come forward to God, you must believe that there is God. This is too shallow. The English translation is very good because it is equivalent to the Greek&mdash;we must believe that God is. This implies everything. Do you need God? God is. Do you need food? God is. This is why we use the word <em>great</em> in saying that Jesus is the <em>great</em> I Am. He told us, &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo; (John 14:6a). &ldquo;I am the resurrection&rdquo; (11:25). &ldquo;I am the door&rdquo; (10:7, 9). &ldquo;I am the good Shepherd&rdquo; (10:11). &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (6:35). He is the real food. There is only one kind of food that is. This food is Jesus, the great I Am. He is the breath (20:22), the living water (4:10, 14), and the tree of life (15:1; 14:6a; Rev. 2:7). He is God (John 1:1; 20:28-29; Rom. 9:5), the Father (Isa. 9:6; John 14:9-10), the Son (Mark 1:1; John 20:31), and the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:45b). He is everything to us.</p>
<p>The Bible says that if you do not believe in Christ, you have no life (John 3:15-16, 36). When I was young, I could not understand this. I thought that as a strong boy, I did have life. Later, I realized that our life is a false one. It is not the life that is. This means that our life is not something that exists forever. We are today, but eventually we will not be tomorrow. So in the whole universe, we are nothing. I am nothing. Our hall is nothing. Anaheim is nothing. California is nothing. The United States is nothing. And the whole globe is nothing! This is because they do not exist forever. The day will come when they will not exist; they will be over. Actually, the things that are seen are not the things that exist; they are vanities (2 Cor. 4:18).</p>
<p>Then what is existing? Who exists? Only the great I Am&mdash;I Am That I Am. He who comes forward to God must believe that God is! Faith is so critical. Without this, you can never make God happy. You must believe that God is. Let me illustrate. If a husband realized that only God is and he is not, then he would not love his wife by himself and in himself. Sisters, when you go shopping, if you realized that in the whole universe only God is, would you buy anything you want? You would realize, &ldquo;I am not. I am nothing. I don&rsquo;t go shopping, but He is, so He goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is faith? Faith is to stop yourself from doing anything. You are nothing. Faith joins you with God to make God the only One who is. I am not, so I should not be the one who loves my wife. It should be Christ loving my wife. He is; I am not. I should not be the one to go shopping. He should be the One. When you pick up something on sale in the department store, you have to check, &ldquo;He is or I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith is to stop you from doing anything but to make God everything to you. This equals Paul&rsquo;s word in Galatians 2:20: &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Who lives? It is no longer I. I do not exist. I was terminated. I was crucified. I am finished. It is no more I, but Christ lives in me. Christ lives. Christ is. Christ exists. I do not exist. This is the very essence of the short word <em>believe that God is.</em> To believe that God is implies that you are not. He must be the only One, the unique One, in everything, and we must be nothing in everything.</p>
<p>The brothers need to ask themselves, &ldquo;Is it me or Christ who is the husband to my wife?&rdquo; If a sister has a husband who does not take Christ as the One who is, she will be miserable. But if her husband is Christ, she has the only Husband, the unique Husband. Only Christ is the Husband. No husbands are real husbands. They are all vanity. Do you come forward to God? If you say yes, then you have to believe that God is, implying that you are nothing. You are finished.</p>
<p>It would be good to speak a word like this at a wedding. The person marrying a couple could say to them, &ldquo;Are you the dear bride, and are you the dear bridegroom?&rdquo; The bridegroom should say, &ldquo;No. I am not. But Christ is.&rdquo; The bride should say, &ldquo;I am not the bride. I am so ugly and poor. I am not pretty. Christ is the beautiful One. I am not the bride, but He is.&rdquo; This is a believer.</p>
<p>When you say what Paul said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more I, but Christ,&rdquo; you believe that God is. To believe that God is, is so deep. It implies that you realize that you are not, but He is. <em>You are not</em> means that you do not exist. This is what the Bible means when it says to deny yourself. When a sister is about to be married, she needs to realize that she is nothing. She should not feel that she is the most beautiful and wonderful one. If she does, her marriage will be finished. That is not a believer&rsquo;s marriage. A believer who is about to be married should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am going to marry this man. Lord, You know I am nothing. I cannot be the proper wife. I am nothing, Lord.&rdquo; What a blessing this is! This is the blessing of denying yourself in everything.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself&rdquo; (Luke 9:23). This word is the same as what Paul said: &ldquo;He who comes forward to God must believe that He is.&rdquo; To deny yourself equals to believe that God is, and to believe that God is equals to deny yourself. This is because you believe that only He is. In the whole universe He is, and all of us are nothing. I should not be anything. I should not exist. Only He should be everything. Only He should exist. So Paul says, &ldquo;I have been crucified. It is no more I, but Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the apostle Paul was Saul, he was a very aggressive young man. Everything with him was &ldquo;I, me, my, and mine.&rdquo; With Saul it was &ldquo;I first, my and mine in the middle, and me last.&rdquo; Everything was Saul of Tarsus. But the Lord Jesus knocked him down on the road to Damascus, and Saul asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; (Acts 9:5). The Lord said, &ldquo;I am Jesus&rdquo; (v. 5). The Lord was saying, &ldquo;I am the great I Am. I am the One that is. You must believe that I am and you are not.&rdquo; Eventually, Saul changed his name. Saul was over, and Paul came up (Acts 13:9 and note 1). This Paul was the one who told us, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; This is to believe that God is.</p>
<p>Nothing can make the unique God happy except one thing. That is faith. Faith is to believe that God is. Then I would check with you, &ldquo;If only God is, where are you?&rdquo; The first stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #483 says, &ldquo;Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too; / What is there left for me to do? / Simply to cease from struggling and strife, / Simply to walk in newness of life. / Glory be to God!&rdquo; Where are you? You are in the tomb. Today who are you? You need to say, &ldquo;It is no more I, but Christ.&rdquo; I would like again to refer to what Darby said: &ldquo;O the joy of having nothing and being nothing, seeing nothing but a living Christ in glory, and being careful for nothing but His interests down here.&rdquo; This is faith. We care for nothing but His interest. We should always say, &ldquo;Not I, not me, not my, not mine; but He, Him, His. He is the first and the last and everything in between.&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ, only Christ&rdquo; (see <em>Hymns,</em> #591&mdash; stanza 5).</p>
<p>Why did John write the book of Revelation and declare, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming&rdquo; (1:4)? This was because the degraded church had become too much. The biggest religious society on this earth is the Catholic Church. They use the term <em>the Church,</em> which refers to the pope. They do not say, &ldquo;Christ says....&rdquo; Instead, they say, &ldquo;The pope says....&rdquo; Whatever the pope says is what they do. But it should be no more the Catholic Church, no more the pope, but Christ. This is to believe that God is, and this is the faith of the believers.</p>
<p>Only faith can make God happy, and faith is to believe that God is. It is not I, but Christ. To believe that God is, is the only way, the unique way, to make God happy, to please God. I would like to ask the sisters, &ldquo;When you are combing your hair, who is combing it?&rdquo; While you are combing your hair, you should say, &ldquo;No longer I, but Christ.&rdquo; But with many sisters it is not Christ, but them. If Christ were doing the combing, He would not comb your hair according to your way. You have to remember this. When you comb your hair, you should be able to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord. It is no more I, but Christ.&rdquo; You and I have to do everything in this way.</p>
<p>When brothers come to visit me, quite often I pray, &ldquo;Lord, the brothers are coming to see me. I am not the one that can meet their need. Lord, You are the One.&rdquo; This is faith&mdash;believing that I should be out and believing that He should be in. I must deny myself in everything and trust in Him in everything. To deny yourself and to trust in Him is faith. This is to believe that God is.</p>
<p>Even at the end of a ministry meeting, we may say, &ldquo;Saints, now it is your turn to share.&rdquo; But we have to say, &ldquo;It is not our turn, but Christ&rsquo;s turn.&rdquo; If we live in this way, the riches of Christ will come out of our mouth. Quite often before coming to a meeting, I pray to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I should not be the speaker, but You. I have been crucified, but You live in me. You should be the speaker.&rdquo; This makes a big difference&mdash;to deny the self, to trust in the Lord, that is, to believe that God is.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You have gathered us again into Your dear name. Lord, we want to be here in Your name. In this name we have Your presence. In this name we enjoy You as the life-giving, all-inclusive Spirit. Lord, even in this gathering we have Your word, Your living word. And we thank You that You cleanse us all the time with Your precious blood. We trust in this cleansing that we might be kept in the fellowship with You, dear Lord&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Lord, give us the utterance. We do not want to be anything in this speaking, but we want to let You be everything. You are the One speaking. We are not. Even, Lord, in the listening, we need You. You are our Listener, and we are not. You replace us. We come to You, Lord. We believe that You as God are, and we are not. Thank You, Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Definition of Faith</h2>
<p>Hebrews 11:1 says, &ldquo;Faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.&rdquo; This is the apostle Paul&rsquo;s definition of faith. In Greek the word for <em>substantiation</em> is the same as the word for <em>substance.</em> In Hebrews 1:3 Paul refers to Christ as the impress of God&rsquo;s substance. We could say that faith is the substance of things hoped for. Things hoped for and things unseen are not in the physical realm. We believers are not for physical things which are in our hands. We are always for things hoped for.</p>
<p>Also, all the things related to us are things not seen. Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:18, &ldquo;Because we do not regard the things which are seen but the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.&rdquo; We should not choose the things in this temporary time. Instead, we should regard the unseen, eternal things. The worldly people regard the things which are seen. They do not care for things not seen. But we are different because we are believers. We may have a car, a house, and other material possessions, but we are not for these things, because we care only for things not seen. We regard all the things not seen from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22.</p>
<p>All of the numerous blessings mentioned in this divine Book are not seen, yet hoped for. We have not seen them, yet we hope for them day by day. So there is the need of faith. Faith is the very substance of the things we hope for. The two biggest things we hope for are the Lord&rsquo;s second coming (1 Thes. 4:13-18; Col. 1:27) and our glorification with His glory (Rom. 8:23-25, 30; Phil. 3:21). Every day I am hoping for these two things. In a certain sense, I am tired of living in this ugly world. I want the Lord Jesus to come back today. I want to be glorified, redeemed in my body and transfigured into His glorious body. These are two big hopes. We know by faith that these things are coming, because faith is the conviction of things not seen and the substance of things hoped for.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Source of Faith</h2>
<p>Now we want to see the source of faith. Surely you and I are not the source. We do not have a bit of faith in ourselves. We have only unbelief. When we hear that the Lord Jesus will come again and that we will be raptured and glorified, there is a question mark within us. The first question mark was placed by the snake, the old serpent. When the serpent tempted Eve, probably he lifted up his head and was himself in the shape of a question mark as he asked, &ldquo;Has God said...?&rdquo; (Gen. 3:1). The question mark is really like a snake. When people read the promises in the Bible, the snake, the question mark, is within them to cause them to doubt God.</p>
<p>We need to exercise our faith to believe in the unseen things. Is the church something seen or something not seen? The church in its most basic definition is a gathering of the called ones. Whenever we, the called ones of God, come together, that is the church. It is seen. But the Bible says more. The church is also the house of God (Eph. 2:19; 1 Tim. 3:15). This is not seen. We may have a gathering, but not have the house of God. There are many kinds of gatherings. Worldly people gather together in nightclubs and social clubs, but our gathering should be the house of God. The assembly is seen, but the house of God is not seen. We have to realize the house of God, not by sight but by faith (2 Cor. 5:7). Everything that we regard is not seen, so we need to exercise our faith.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Faith Comes out of the Hearing of the Word</h2>
<p>According to Romans 10:17, faith comes out of the hearing of the word. Thus, the source of faith is the word, but we have to realize the crystallization of this point. There are three aspects of the word. First, there is the written word of God&mdash;the Bible (John 10:35). Then there is the living word of God&mdash;Christ (John 1:1). Finally, there is the applied word of God&mdash;the Spirit (Eph. 6:17; John 6:63).</p>
<p>The Bible is the written word, and Christ is the living word. Without the Spirit, however, the living word cannot be applied to us. The living word becomes the applied word through the Spirit. God has only one kind of word. First, He spoke, and what He spoke was written in a book. That is the Bible. There is only one book that is the word of God. The term <em>Bible</em> means &ldquo;the book.&rdquo; The Bible is the book of books. What a mercy and what a wonder that in human history such a book has been produced&mdash;the word of God! The world today is a mess. So many bad things are reported in today&rsquo;s newspapers. Suppose the Bible were taken away from mankind. I do not think that mankind could exist without the word of God.</p>
<p>We have such a word, but not many have really been benefited by this word. This is why we have to either read or hear the Bible. Every week we gather together a number of times just to read, speak, and hear the word. When the word of the Bible is spoken to us and heard by us, right away the written word becomes the living word. That is Christ. When the living word is applied to us and received by us, it becomes the word of the Spirit. Then this word of the Spirit heard by us is the source of our faith. Faith comes from the hearing of this applied word by the Spirit through the living Christ out of the written Bible.</p>
<p>Early in the morning you may read the Bible, but without prayer and without calling on the name of the Lord. Then the word of God is merely the written word to you. It has nothing to do with you subjectively. So you have to have some contact with the Lord by calling on Him and pray-reading the word. When you call on Him and pray-read the word, right away you have the deep sensation that Christ is living within you. Then you would say, &ldquo;Lord, I love You. I love this word here. How I love Hebrews 11:6: &lsquo;He who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.&rsquo;&rdquo; Right away this written word becomes a living word and then an applied word to you. Then you get into your car and drive to your office. While you are driving, you have something living applied to you. Then you have faith. Faith comes from this source. This is our crystallization-study of the source of faith.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. All Three Refer to God Himself<br />
Embodied in Christ and Realized in the Spirit</h2>
<p>All three&mdash;the written word, the living word, and the applied word&mdash;refer to God Himself. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). The Word here is a person. God&rsquo;s written word in the Bible becomes Christ as the living word, who is applied into us as the Spirit, the word of the Spirit. That is God Himself. The more that God is gained by you in this way, the more He becomes your faith.</p>
<p>Thus, the source of faith is God. He is the One who calls things not being as being and gives life to the dead (Rom. 4:17). In Genesis 1, there was no light, so God said, &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; and light was there (v. 3). We are related to God through these three aspects of His word: the written word, the living word, and the applied word. Then we enjoy God as the One who calls not being as being and who gives life to the dead. Nothing is impossible to faith (see <em>Hymns,</em> #535), because faith is actually God Himself.</p>
<p>The more of God you have, the more faith you have. We can gain God by coming to the Bible, the written word. But if we merely read the Bible, it could only be the dead letter to us. Before reading the Bible, it is good to call on the Lord at least two or three times, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Right away, the written word of the Bible becomes the living word. That is Christ. Then we react to Him, and He becomes the word as the Spirit, the word applied by the Spirit. Then we have God. God is added into our being, and this God is the source of faith.</p>
<p>The God who calls not being as being and who gives life to the dead is embodied in Christ. Whenever you have God, you have His embodiment, and His embodiment is Christ. This embodiment is realized in the Spirit. So the faith is the faith of God, the faith of Christ (Gal. 2:20, 16; 3:22, 26; Rom. 3:22), and the faith of the Spirit. Thus, the faith is the faith of the embodied and realized Triune God.</p>
<p>To study the Bible in this way is what I call the study of crystallization. For twenty years I have been having a life-study of the Bible. Now our study has been uplifted to another level, a higher level. We have gone on from the life-study to the crystallization-study.</p>
<p>The crystallization of faith is to believe that God is. The crystallization of the source of faith is God in His written word contacted as the living word and applied as the word of the Spirit so that we can gain the Triune God, who is able to call not being as being and give life to the dead. This One is embodied in Christ and realized in the Spirit. So faith is the Triune God embodied and realized. God in the written word becomes the living word applied as the word of the Spirit. Thus, God embodied in Christ and realized in the Spirit is faith.</p><h2 class="head2">G. The Effect of Faith&mdash;<br />
Nothing Being Impossible to Faith</h2>
<p>In Matthew 17:20b the Lord spoke concerning the effect of faith: &ldquo;If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.&rdquo; Nothing is impossible to faith. <em>Hymns,</em> #535, written by Charles Wesley, expresses this effect of faith:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>All things are possible to him<br />
That can in Jesus&rsquo; name believe;<br />
Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme,<br />
Thy truth I lovingly receive.<br />
I can, I do believe in Thee;<br />
All things are possible to me.<br /><br /></li>
<li>&rsquo;Twas most impossible of all<br />
That here sin&rsquo;s reign in me should cease;<br />
Yet shall it be, I know it shall;<br />
Jesus, I trust Thy faithfulness.<br />
If nothing is too hard for Thee,<br />
All things are possible to me.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Though earth and hell the Word gainsay,<br />
The Word of God shall never fail;<br />
The Lord can break sin&rsquo;s iron sway;<br />
&rsquo;Tis certain, though impossible.<br />
The thing impossible shall be,<br />
All things are possible to me.<br /><br />
<li>All things are possible to God;<br />
To Christ, the power of God in man;<br />
To me when I am all renewed,<br />
In Christ am fully formed again,<br />
And from the reign of sin set free,<br />
All things are possible to me.<br /><br /></li>
<li>All things are possible to God;<br />
To Christ, the power of God in me;<br />
Now shed Thy mighty Self abroad,<br />
Let me no longer live, but Thee;<br />
Give me this hour in Thee to prove<br />
The sweet omnipotence of love.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only God is all-able, omnipotent; nothing is impossible to Him (Matt. 19:26). But the Lord also indicates that nothing is impossible to faith. So this indicates faith and God, God and faith, are one. If you do not have God, God remains apart from you. If you have God in you, this God becomes faith. Faith is the subjective God applied to your being. Thus, just as nothing is impossible to God, nothing is impossible to faith.</p><h2 class="head2">H. The Household of Faith</h2>
<p>The believers are the believing ones in Christ, who are the household of faith (Gal. 6:10). In the universe there are many houses with many households. But there is one particular house with millions of members. That is the house of faith. We belong to this house. This is a big family, and the family name is <em>faith.</em> This is the home of faith. We may say that a certain home is the Smith home or the Lee home. Now we are all members of the &ldquo;faith home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are believers, who do not believe nonsensical things. We believe in the word, and the word has three stages: the written word, the living word, and the applied word. Over two thousand years ago, there was only the written word, not the living word, because Christ was not here yet. Today we have the living word. Without Christ as the living word, it was very hard for God&rsquo;s word to become the applied word as the Spirit. This is because before Christ came, the Spirit was mostly objective; He was not yet within God&rsquo;s people. Before Christ, the Spirit of God was upon God&rsquo;s people. But today we have the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit indwelling us all the time. Thus, when we touch the Bible, right away the Bible can become living and applied.</p>
<p>We are the members of the family, the household, of faith. This faith house is a house that believes in God through His word. Hebrews 1 says that God has spoken (v. 2). This word becomes the living word, Christ, and this living word is applied by the Spirit. Then we have the Triune God as the word in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. The Believers&rsquo; Faith in Christ Bringing Them<br />
into the Life Union with Christ</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; faith in Christ brings them into the life union with Christ (John 3:15, 36). This is my point in this message.</p>
<p>In just thirty-three and a half years, from Christ&rsquo;s incarnation to His resurrection, great things were accomplished in the universe. The worldly people do not see these things, but thank God for His mercy to mankind. Whatever took place in these thirty-three and a half years as great things has been written in the New Testament. Today when we read the New Testament, we have to see all these great things.</p>
<p>The New Testament begins with a genealogy. Matthew 1:1 says, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&rdquo; This is Christ&rsquo;s incarnation. The first great thing that was accomplished in the whole universe was God&rsquo;s incarnation, God&rsquo;s becoming a man. Then there was His living for thirty-three and a half years, recorded in the four Gospels. How great this was! Then He entered into death, passed through death, came out of death, and entered into resurrection. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have published thousands of messages on these things.</p>
<p>Three results came out of His resurrection. First, He, the only begotten Son of God, became the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29), indicating many sons of God are following. So the second thing is that millions of us, the believers, were born with Him (1 Pet. 1:3). He was born as the firstborn Son of God, and we were born as the many sons of God. We are His &ldquo;twins.&rdquo; Third, this One, who was the Only Begotten becoming the Firstborn with many twins, became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and this life-giving Spirit is the consummation and aggregate of the processed Triune God. Out of this consummation of the Triune God, the church came into being, and the church as the house of God is the Body of Christ. This Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God which consummates in the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will remain in the new heaven and new earth as a city expressing God for eternity in divinity mingled with humanity. This is our New Testament.</p>
<p>When we read the New Testament, we read these things. The more we read, the more we contact the written word of the New Testament. Then we have Christ as the living word and the Spirit as the applied word. The word of God is embodied in Christ and realized in the Spirit to be our faith. This faith brings us into the life union with Christ, who is the embodiment of God realized as the all-inclusive Spirit. Faith links us with the Triune God.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

<p>Prayer: Dear Lord, we are happy to give You thanks for bringing us into such a high level. Lord, here we can see something marvelous, something excellent, something that will surprise us to the uttermost. Lord, release Yourself. This is all that we need. We need only You as the great I Am. Amen.</p>
<p>In the previous message we pointed out <em>Hymns,</em> #535 by Charles Wesley. I like his hymns very much, but I had never paid much attention to this hymn until recently. There is a wonderful line in stanza 5 which says, &ldquo;Let me no longer live, but Thee.&rdquo; It is marvelous that such a line is in this hymn on faith. Faith is to believe that God is, and I am not. I do believe that Charles Wesley must have noticed this point. Otherwise, how could he have said in his hymn: &ldquo;Let me no longer live, but Thee.&rdquo; This is faith. Faith always annuls us and reveals Christ to us.</p>
<p>In this message we are still on the structure of the gospel of God. We all have seen clearly that this divine structure is of three parts: the righteousness of God, the life of Christ, and the faith of the believers. The structure of God&rsquo;s gospel is first the judicial part. The righteousness of God is a matter of judicial standing related to the law. Then the life of Christ, which is organic, is a matter of life. The third part, the faith of the believers, is practical. This is a matter of practice. Regardless of how much the righteousness of God and the life of Christ are in this universe, without the faith of the believers, nothing can happen.</p>
<p>The righteousness of God is wonderful. It is judicial, fulfilling all the requirements of God&rsquo;s law. The righteousness of God as a part of God&rsquo;s salvation makes God happy. He is satisfied and joyful because His righteousness has judicially fulfilled all the legal requirements of the divine law. Then the life of Christ organically is the completion of God&rsquo;s salvation for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ expressed as the local churches. But if there is no faith of the believers, nothing will happen. So it is the faith of the believers that links God&rsquo;s righteousness and Christ&rsquo;s life with us. At one time we were unbelieving sinners. When we heard the gospel and repented, we spontaneously called on the name of the Lord: &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; By calling on the Lord, the &ldquo;linking&rdquo; faith got into us that linked us, the great sinners, with the righteousness of God and with the life of Christ. Then we became altogether another person.</p>
<p>I still remember my conversion when I was at the end of my nineteenth year of age. I was born into, raised up, and educated in Christianity. I had heard much preaching and teaching about the Bible, though I was not saved. But one afternoon I heard the gospel, and within a few hours I was a changed person. Actually, it was the linking faith that changed me. At that time from my sincere heart, from the depths of my being, I cried to God. That was the faith which had been imparted into me as my believing element, which linked me with the marvelous God. Faith is the linking of our salvation that links God with us and links us to God. This linking makes us the God-men. I was a sinner, an enemy of God, but I became a God-man. This is because something linked into me, linked with me, and linked me to God. That was faith.</p><h2 class="head2">J. The Believers Living Christ by This Faith</h2>
<p>The believers live Christ by this faith (as defined in the preceding items), the faith of Christ, the Son of God (Gal. 2:20b). We cannot live Christ by and in ourselves. We live Christ by a linking organ. This linking organ is faith. So Paul said in Galatians 2:20 that the life that he lived, he lived by faith, the faith of Jesus the Son of God. It was as if Paul were saying, &ldquo;I live Christ not by my faith, but by the faith of Jesus the Son of God; that is not my faith, but His faith.&rdquo; This implies a lot. Here we need another kind of crystallization.</p>
<p>How could you live Christ? You need to call upon Him by saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I love You.&rdquo; Call on Him and say just this much to Him. Then right away He &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; within you, and this &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; Jesus becomes your faith. This &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; Jesus as the faith imparted into you links you with Him. Then you cannot help but live Him during the day. When you call on Him in this way, He becomes the faith imparted into you so that you spontaneously live Him by this faith.</p>
<p>You should call on Him in such a way when you arise in the morning. Then at nine o&rsquo;clock, at your work, you can look at the ceiling and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are so good.&rdquo; There is no need to say much. To speak to the Lord a little bit is good enough. When you say this to the Lord, you receive another infilling. Christ right away is imparted into you as your faith. Actually, He Himself as the faith becomes your faith, and this is the linking organ that links you to the unlimited, infinite Christ.</p>
<p>Later, at noontime at the lunch table, you can say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I don&rsquo;t know what to say to You. I am so happy.&rdquo; This brief word is good enough for you to receive another refilling. In the afternoon you may go to the rest room. Before you go in, you may say another brief word to Him by calling on His name. &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I don&rsquo;t know where I am or where I am going. Lord, You have made me beside myself toward You.&rdquo; Just talk this much to Him and you will have another refilling.</p>
<p>When I tell people to call on the name of the Lord, they think that they need to call on Him loudly and repeatedly. There is nothing wrong with this. Whatever way we call upon the Lord is right. But it is not necessary for us to call in that way in order to be filled. We can just say a simple word: &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You know I am too busy. I have to rush to go to the office. Thank You, Lord.&rdquo; With just this little bit of calling, you are infused. The infusing of Christ in you causes you to have Him in you as your faith, which is the linking organ that links you with Him. This is the way to live Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. The Believers Walking and Suffering<br />
Persecution by This Faith</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:7 says that we believers do not walk by sight, by appearance, but by faith. Sight brings you a lot of things, but faith annuls all things. When sight is here, you see all the material things. When faith comes in, all these physical things disappear. We walk by faith; we walk not by what we see, but by what we do not see.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:7 is a clear word concerning walking by faith and not by that which is seen. But for many years I did not understand this word. Now that I have been following the Lord by faith for nearly seventy years, I can tell you what it is to walk by faith. Because it is hard to find the utterance to tell you, I feel it would be best to share a brief testimony of my experience.</p>
<p>At the same time that I was saved, I was called by God. So I told Him, &ldquo;God, from today, I do not want anything that people would give me. Even the world I don&rsquo;t want. I just want You, and I will bring the Bible to the villages to preach You.&rdquo; I did not realize much of what I was saying, but spontaneously, I talked to God by faith. Eventually, He brought me out of my job to serve Him with my full time. But the Lord did not send me to the villages. Instead, He started His ministry with me from the city of Chefoo to the greatest city in China, Shanghai. I was there serving Him with joy.</p>
<p>Later I returned to Chefoo. Once I returned, I did not have the liberty to move anymore because war between Japan and China broke out. During that time I had a thought to develop northwest China, close to Mongolia, for the Lord&rsquo;s interests. I thought we had both the people and the finances from the churches in north and northeast China to carry this out. Close to the end of the war, I was arrested by the Japanese invading army&rsquo;s political police, and they kept me in prison for one month. I suffered a lot. After being released, I became seriously ill with tuberculosis of the lungs. The doctor told me that I needed to have total rest in bed for six months. Eventually, it took two and a half years for me to come out of that illness. After I came out of my illness, the war was over. My plan to develop northwest China never materialized because the political situation had changed, and in 1946 I was invited to Shanghai again.</p>
<p>At that time the church in Shanghai became revived and was flourishing. As a result, there was the need to build a big hall. In 1948 we were able to purchase about one-fourth of an acre of land in Shanghai. When we were going to sign the agreement, I asked the elders, &ldquo;Do you feel we should buy it?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. We just look to you. If you say buy, we will buy. If not, we will not buy.&rdquo; Shanghai was the central commercial port in China and the land was very expensive. This quarter of an acre of land cost one hundred five thousand dollars. That was forty-six years ago in China. The terms of the agreement were that we had to pay one-third of this amount immediately. Then we had to make another payment the next month, and another payment the third month. What the church had, however, was sufficient only to make the first payment. Furthermore, the seller of the land would accept payment only in gold bars.</p>
<p>When the day was approaching for us to pay for the land, a brother came to me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you know that I am here representing my family from Manchuria [northeast China]. We have purchased many gold bars. I would like to advance the money for the church. Then whatever the church will receive as giving from the saints can go to our account.&rdquo; I was very happy with this arrangement. That was the way the Lord took care of this need in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In 1949 I was sent by Brother Nee in the work out of mainland China to Taiwan. I had ten family members under my care at that time, but all I had when I arrived in Taiwan was three hundred U.S. dollars. That money was sufficient to feed my family for only three months. I also wondered how I was going to start the Lord&rsquo;s work there.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Lord sent me to the Philippines, where I stayed for five and a half months. A brother who was a businessman came to me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, tell me how much you need for the work of the Lord in Taiwan, including purchasing and building the halls and support for the co-workers and their families.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brother, we do not let people know what we need.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, this is not you telling me what you need. This is me coming to you to ask you because I have a heart for the Lord. You tell me.&rdquo; Then I told him about our need.</p>
<p>From 1951 to 1961, this brother passed on a large sum of money each year to cover all the needs of the work in Taiwan. When I first went to Taiwan, I was the unique one who served full-time. No others dared to go this way because of the question of who would support them. When I got such a promise from the brother in the Philippines, I started the work in Taiwan by training. Through this training in one year, over eighty saints became full-timers to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>After ten years in Taiwan, I had a small thought within me that the Lord&rsquo;s work may need to turn to the United States from Taiwan. The work in Taiwan had been greatly blessed by the Lord. Within five years we increased from five hundred saints to fifty thousand. But there was the need for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to turn to the Western world. When I came to the United States, I was warmly welcomed and received by many saints who were prepared by God to receive this ministry. I came to the United States with only a few hundred dollars and no promise of support. I just spoke the word by faith.</p>
<p>Within ten years&rsquo; time in the United States, our work became flourishing. Then the Lord led us to come to Anaheim, and He supplied us with a big meeting hall for the work. The land for this hall was bought at a very cheap price. It was two and a half acres, but the seller wanted only about $220,000. He wanted us to put in $20,000, and the rest he would bear as a kind of loan. Each year we paid only $20,000. This was just like a gift. When the churches in the United States heard about this, they sent eighty young students to Anaheim for half a year to help in the building of the meeting hall. So today we have this very useful facility. These are examples of walking by faith.</p>
<p>To walk by faith is to walk by something you do not know. Some of the young people may be burdened to serve the Lord full-time, but they may wonder how they can be supported. If you think in this way, you are walking by sight, not by faith. Throughout the years I have walked by faith, but eventually all things came to me. I was saved by the Lord from the Japanese army&rsquo;s hand. Otherwise, they would have killed me. The Lord also saved me from death due to tuberculosis of the lungs. This is to walk by faith. The worldly people do not have God. They have only the things they can see. But because we have God, we do not walk by anything we see. We walk by our unseen God. Eventually, all the things we need come to us. This faith links us all the time to God.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1991 President Bush made the decision to bomb Iraq. This took place for one hundred hours. One day, after that bombing, a thought arose within me concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery being brought to Russia. When I talked to the co-workers about this, they all agreed. In May 1991 during a Memorial Day conference, we made the announcement that we would go to Russia. At that time over eighty saints, most of them young people, consecrated themselves to go to Russia. Also, within a short time, millions of dollars of offerings came in from different churches for the support of the Lord&rsquo;s move to Russia.</p>
<p>Today, three years later, we have about 120 co-workers there, with about thirty family members. One-fourth of them are Chinese from Taiwan; three-fourths are Americans from the United States. They are being supported by faith. We did not have any kind of fundraising, nor did we put out an advertisement. We simply let the churches know that the Lord is leading us this way. Then the manpower and the money came in. Also, in the past few years, we have distributed more than six million copies of our publications, which have reached over three thousand cities in Russia and the Ukraine. We have baptized over thirteen thousand Russians and have big churches in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Today there are over one thousand saints in each of these churches. The Lord did this by our walking by faith.</p>
<p>At that time I did not consider where we could get the money. Recently a friend asked me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, what is your plan, your schedule?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;We have no plan, no schedule.&rdquo; After the thought came to us to go to Russia, we simply walked by faith, and the Lord met all the needs. To walk by faith means that our walking is linked with God, and He is altogether rich. We walk by faith, and faith links us to Him.</p>
<p>In Luke 18 the Lord indicates that we also suffer persecution by this faith. We have to learn to pray for our suffering. In verse 8 the Lord said, &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?&rdquo; This means we have to suffer all the persecutions by faith. I have been in the United States for thirty-four years. In the first twelve years, I was very warmly welcomed and received. Then the opposers paid their attention to this ministry. They raised up resistance, opposition, and defamation to damage us. Thus, in the last twenty-two years I have been bitterly defamed. The opposers surely have tried to devastate our work and damage our reputation. I am under persecution every day by faith. If you are going to follow the Lord, you have to walk by faith, not being threatened by any kind of opposition.</p><h2 class="head2">L. The Believers Needing to Look Away unto<br />
Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of Their Faith</h2>
<p>Hebrews 12:2 says that we need to look away to Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith. We need to look away from everything other than Jesus. Many things are distracting us. When some of the young people came to the full-time training, they may have had their own thought about how wonderful the training was. Then after coming, they may have been disappointed. It is the same with the church life. You may look at the saints and the situation in your locality and be very disappointed. But I would ask, &ldquo;Where is a church that can satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the record of the New Testament, no church is that good. All the churches established by the apostle Paul became degraded. When Paul wrote 2 Timothy, he told his young co-worker, Timothy, that all the churches in Asia had abandoned his ministry (1:15). In the same way, we are still suffering from a rebellion among us which began in September 1987. When Paul wrote 2 Timothy, he was ready to be martyred (4:6). At that time he declared, &ldquo;I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith&rdquo; (v. 7). By reading 2 Timothy, we can see that nothing in Paul&rsquo;s outward environment and situation was encouraging. Everything was disappointing. This shows that we need to learn how to walk and suffer by faith.</p>
<p>To learn to walk by faith, to suffer by faith, you have to look away from all things. Do not look at your roommate. Do not look at the elders. Do not look at the old sisters. Do not look at me. Look away unto Jesus. This is because only Jesus is. All the others are not. Anyone other than Jesus is nothing, so do not look to anyone except Him. We trust in the Lord. We do not trust in anyone else. Only He is. So look away from all things which are not, unto Jesus who is. This is faith. Jesus is the Author and Perfecter of our faith, so our faith is just Jesus. He is the origin and the completion of our faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">M. The Eternal Economy of God<br />
Being in Such a Faith</h2>
<p>First Timothy 1:4 speaks of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s economy, which is in faith.&rdquo; Anyone who has a plan to do something would not tell you that his plan is in faith. But the Bible tells us that God&rsquo;s economy is in faith. Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen (Heb. 11:1). God&rsquo;s economy is a kind of plan concerning things not seen by us. I have been in the center of the work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for over sixty years. I saw many people come into the recovery with a big dream. After they came in, they looked around and saw nothing. There is nothing here but Jesus! We need to look away from everything that is nothing, unto Jesus.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3:17 tells us that Christ is making His home in our hearts &ldquo;through faith.&rdquo; Christ is making His home, His building, in our hearts with Himself as the material. If you were to tell an unbeliever this, he might say, &ldquo;Who is Christ and where is Christ? How can He make His home in you?&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s indwelling is mysterious and abstract. We apprehend it not by our physical senses but by the sense of faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">N. The Righteousness of God<br />
Being Revealed out of Such a Faith and<br />
to Such a Faith in the Gospel of God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s righteousness is revealed in the gospel out of faith and to faith (Rom. 1:17a). The righteousness of God is a great thing, and the New Testament stresses it. In Matthew 5:20 the Lord said, &ldquo;For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul charged Timothy to pursue after righteousness first, with the ones who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Then 2 Peter 3:13 tells us that righteousness will dwell in the coming new heaven and new earth. Righteousness is very crucial, but it is revealed to us only out of faith and to faith. This means that if you are going to enjoy the righteousness of God in the gospel, you must be a person of faith. We can be such a person through contacting the Lord by calling on Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">O. Such a Faith Being the Initial Righteousness of<br />
the Believers before God and God Rewarding<br />
Those Who Seek Him in Such a Faith</h2>
<p>Genesis 15:6 says concerning Abraham, &ldquo;And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.&rdquo; Such a faith is the top righteousness. God is righteous, and He is for righteousness. He wants us to practice righteousness, and our initial righteousness is faith. You must have faith as a start of your righteousness before God.</p>
<p>Also, Hebrews 11:6 says that if you are seeking God in such a faith, God will give you a reward, a prize. This shows how important faith is. We must have this faith exercised within us. Then we have God&rsquo;s righteousness revealed to us, and we have the initial righteousness before God. If we have this exercise of faith, God will reward us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">P. The Believers Speak for the Lord,<br />
Speak the Lord Forth, and Speak the Lord<br />
into People by Such a Faith</h2>
<p>Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4 that he spoke by the spirit of faith. He said, &ldquo;We...believe, therefore we also speak&rdquo; (v. 13). If you do not believe that Christ is making His home in your heart, how can you go to tell others? You have to believe that Christ lives in you and that if you die with Him through the cross, He is now as the resurrection working Himself into you. This is all by faith. If you do not believe in these things, how can you speak to others? The reason that you do not prophesy, that you do not speak for the Lord, speak the Lord forth, and speak the Lord into others, is mainly because your exercise of faith is short.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Q. The Way to Receive Such a Faith</h2>
<p>The way to receive such a faith is to contact its source, the Lord, the processed and consummated God, by calling on Him, praying to Him, and pray-reading His word (Heb. 4:16; Rom. 10:12; 2 Tim. 2:22; Eph. 6:17-18). We have to come forward to God&rsquo;s throne of grace to receive mercy and grace. This means that we have to contact God to receive faith. This is the only way. It is not necessary to have a separate time to contact God. At any time, anywhere, you can contact Him. Just call on Him and say a little word to Him. Then you will receive faith. This faith links you with God and imparts, transfuses, God into you. In this way you will have the living faith. Actually, that is God Himself moving within you. Then you will become a man of faith.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

</ol>
<p>In this message we want to see six more crucial points related to the crystallization of <em>the faith of the believers</em>.</p>
<h2 class="head2">R. The Linking Faith</h2>
<p>The first crucial point is the linking faith. We have spoken about this to a certain extent, but we want to go into more depth here. Actually, faith has different stages. In the first section of our crystallization-study on faith, we saw that faith comes from the hearing of the word (Rom. 10:17). That is the initial stage of faith. When we were sinners, one day under God&rsquo;s sovereignty we heard the preaching of the gospel, that is, the word of Christ. Through that hearing of the word, faith came into us. This faith brought us into a life union with Christ. This union is a kind of linking.</p>
<p>The electricity in a building is a very good illustration of linking. The installment of the electricity into the building is the first stage. Then from that day, this installed electricity continues in this building. In like manner, when we heard the gospel, we repented, and something happened to us. That was the installation of the Spirit. We had the Spirit installed into us through the hearing of the word. We all received the Spirit in this way. Now this Spirit, or this faith, which has been installed into us, stays within us and grows.</p>
<p>After electricity has been installed into a certain building, there is a current going on. You can either stop it or use it all the time. Also, when we were saved, the linking faith entered into us, and it remains in us. The faith through which we were saved became a linking faith within us. This is not just in the initial stage, but also in the progressing stage. In a building in which electricity has been installed in the initial stage, there is a current of electricity going on in the progressing stage. We are like the building. We have the faith, the initial faith, produced in us. It remains in us and goes on all the time, unless we stop it.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Having Life and Living by Faith</h2>
<p>Romans 1:17 says, &#8220;The righteous shall have life and live by faith.&#8221; We not only have life but also live by faith. To live is a matter of continuation. Romans 1:17 is Paul&#8217;s quotation of Habakkuk 2:4, which is also referred to by Paul in Galatians 3:11 and Hebrews 10:38. The Christian life is not just a matter of having life by faith. You have to live by faith for your whole life. We are not believers for just a small amount of time. We are believers for eternity. We not only have life but also live by what we have. We live by faith. This is the linking faith which continues with us in our living.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Living in Faith, the Faith of the Son of God</h2>
<p>Galatians 2:20 says, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God....&#8221; Many among us know this verse, but actually Galatians 2:20 is difficult to understand. If I am crucified without Christ, that is pitiful, but we have been crucified with Christ. He takes care of the matter. He bears the responsibility. Christ does not live by Himself alone. Christ lives &#8220;in me.&#8221; We should circle the words <em>in me</em> in our Bible. If we saw that Christ lives in us, we would be excited.</p>
<p>You were crucified. It is no longer you, yet Christ still lives in you. You say &#8220;no longer,&#8221; but something is still going on. So Galatians 2:20 continues by saying, &#8220;...and the life which I now live in the flesh.&#8221; Christ lives in me, and I now live a life in the flesh. I live this life in faith. It is no longer I who live, but still I live. The &#8220;I&#8221; who no longer lives is the old creation. The &#8220;I&#8221; who now lives is the new creation. We all have two statuses: the old creation and the new creation, the old man and the new man. As to the old creation, the old man, it is no longer I who live. But I have another status-the new creation, the new man. As to the new creation, the new man, I still live. I live this life in faith. This means faith is going on. In Romans 1:17 to have life by faith is the initiation. But here Paul says, &#8220;I live in faith.&#8221; Faith is going on.</p>
<p>I live by faith, and this faith is not my faith. This faith is the faith of the Son of God. These three items-God, the Son of God, and faith-are one. When you heard the gospel, you heard the word, and faith came into you. That faith is God Himself. Now you live by that faith, and this faith is the faith of the Son of God. Initially, you received the faith which is God coming into you. But now you still live by this faith, yet in the second stage. In the second stage, it is the faith of the Son of God. So when you live this life by faith, you do not live by anything of yourself. You live this life by faith, which is the faith of the Son of God. Thus, you have life by the faith of God, and you live this life by the faith of the Son of God. Faith, God, and the Son of God are one. Faith links God and the Son of God with us. If you have faith, faith links you to God. If you have faith, faith links you to the Son of God.</p>
<p>The initial faith in the initial stage came to you through the hearing of the word of God. But faith in the second stage, the stage to live Christ, comes mostly not by hearing the word. Faith in this stage comes into you by your contacting God in Christ. So you have to contact the Triune God all the time. All the time you should contact the Son. Then you will also touch the Father and the Spirit. Faith in the second stage comes to us through our contacting the Triune God. It is not just to hear the word. In the second stage of faith, hearing the word does not work much.</p>
<p>In this stage, faith comes into you increasingly like the electrical current in a building. You can tell that a &#8220;current&#8221; in you is going on. The more you say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; the more the current is going on. The more you pray, the more the current is going on. This is why we are told to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). This current should not be stopped. This is the linking stage of faith. This faith within us is God Himself in Christ.</p>
<p>The electricity in a building links the building with the power plant, even though the power plant may be a hundred miles away. The electricity in a building also links all the lamps together. There are many lamps but only one electricity, and this one electricity is the linking factor which links all the lamps and the entire building with the power plant. Check with your experience. If you do not pray for one day, you feel you are cut off from the divine power plant. If you do not pray for two days, you feel you are not only cut off from God but also cut off from all the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. We Live Because He Lives in Us</h2>
<p>In John 14:19 the Lord said, &#8220;Because I live, you also shall live.&#8221; It may seem that He lives alone, and we also live alone. But the following verse says, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (v. 20). The Lord does not live alone. He lives in us, and we live in Him. This is co-inhering. Here we can also see the linking. Faith links us to the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head2">S. The God-allotted Faith</h2>
<p>According to 2 Peter 1:1, such a linking faith is the God-allotted faith. No doubt, Peter said this in light of the Old Testament type of the good land. In the Old Testament, when the children of Israel entered into the good land, Joshua allotted the good land under God&rsquo;s leading (Josh. 13:6). One lot was designated to one person, and another lot was designated to another person. God allotted the good land to each of the Israelites. That was a type. Now in the New Testament God has allotted faith to us. The good land in the Old Testament typifies Christ. Christ is our good land. But here in 2 Peter 1:1 it says that God allotted faith to us. This is because faith, God, and Christ are one. God&rsquo;s allotting faith to us means that He allotted Himself to us. It also means He allotted Christ to us. Colossians 1:12 says that Christ is the God-allotted portion, the lot, allotted to us by God. Christ is our lot, and faith is also our lot. It seems God has allotted to us two things: faith and Christ. But faith and Christ are one thing.</p>
<p>To say God has allotted Christ to you is somewhat shallow. Even the new beginners can know this. But to say God has allotted faith to us is deeper. To say that God has allotted Christ to us is a kind of objective teaching, without experience. But God&rsquo;s allotting faith to us is not just an objective teaching, but a subjective experience. This God-allotted faith links us with Christ. So when you have faith, you have Christ. This is why such a faith is the faith of Jesus Christ the Son of God. Jesus the Son of God becomes the Author and the Perfecter of this faith (Heb. 12:2).</p>
<p>To say that faith is Christ Himself may be an objective doctrine. No experience is needed. But to say that faith is allotted by God to us implies that this faith right now links you to the allotted Christ. So these two things are one. In 2 Peter 1:1 we are told that God has allotted to us such a faith. Then verse 3 says that the divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness. Faith as God&rsquo;s lot to us is all the things which relate to life and godliness.</p>
<p>We realize that we need to grow in life, but how can we grow in life? We grow by faith linking us to Christ. We can have the linking faith not just by hearing the word but by contacting the very Triune God who is faith to us. This faith is not the faith in the initial stage but the faith in the second, linking stage. Today&rsquo;s revival and the new revival is just to stir people up to contact the Triune God so that this faith in the second stage may work in the linking way. When you contact the living God, right away you are revived. This is the effectiveness of the linking faith.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. &ldquo;Equally Precious&rdquo; (in Quality,<br />
Not in Quantity) to All the Believers</h2>
<p>God has allotted to us equally precious faith. It is equally precious to all the believers. Let us again use the illustration of electricity. Electricity is allotted to this building, and it links all the lamps together. This electricity in all the lamps is the same in quality and in quantity because the size of the lamps is the same. But the very faith in us, while being the same in quality, is not the same in quantity. We cannot compare with the apostle Paul. His linking faith may be like a big mountain, while ours may be like a small stone. But you have to realize that the stone grows! In the Bible the stones are living (1 Pet. 2:5). If you contact God, faith grows in you. This means that God increases in you. When God increases in you, faith in the second stage grows in you to get bigger and bigger. We all have the same faith in quality, but the quantity of faith we have depends upon how much we contact the living God so that we may have Him increased in us. When God increases in you, this faith in the second stage also grows in you.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. &ldquo;In the Righteousness of Our<br />
God and Savior, Jesus Christ&rdquo;</h2>
<p>God has allotted to us such a faith &ldquo;in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:1). God allotted this equal faith to us according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, in a judicial way. Suppose God had not become our Savior, and we did not have a Redeemer. How could God have allotted faith to us? Because God became a man and died on the cross to be our Savior judicially, He can allot Himself into our being as the linking faith.</p><h2 class="head2">T. God Apportioning to Each a Measure of Faith</h2>
<p>Romans 12:3 says, &ldquo;Not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith.&rdquo; If you think you are bigger than Paul in the quantity of faith, you are crazy. You are not sober-minded. If you are really sober-minded, you will say, &ldquo;Brother Paul was a big mountain. I am just a small stone.&rdquo; Some of the saints may think that they are bigger than the elders. This is not sober-minded. At least the elders are &ldquo;two inches&rdquo; bigger than you. They are at least a little bigger, a little older spiritually, than you. To think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think without a sober mind is to annul the proper order of the Body life.</p>
<p>In Romans 12 Paul dealt with the practice of the Body life. In the crystallization of <em>the Body</em> there is one crucial point, that is, not to think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith. God has not only allotted but also apportioned faith to us. He gave us the same faith in quality but not in quantity. The matter of quantity depends upon how you grow. If you grow today as the apostle Paul grew, the portion of faith you receive will be greatly enlarged. God first allotted faith to us in quality, and then He apportioned it in quantity. What kind of faith you have depends upon God&rsquo;s allotment. How much faith you have depends upon God&rsquo;s apportioning. God&rsquo;s apportioning depends upon your attitude. If you are not sober-minded, God would not increase His apportioning of faith to you, and He probably would even decrease it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">U. Both Salvation and Faith Being the Gift of God</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:8 says, &ldquo;By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.&rdquo; Both salvation and faith are the gift of God. God gave us salvation freely. He also gives us faith freely to receive His free salvation. Both are God&rsquo;s gift.</p>
<h2 class="head2">V. Being Encouraged through the Faith<br />
Which Is in One Another</h2>
<p>In Romans 1:12 Paul said, &ldquo;I with you may be encouraged among you through the faith which is in one another, both yours and mine.&rdquo; This is the mutual faith in one another. When you meet an unbeliever, right away you can realize you have something which he does not have. This is like the lamps in a building all being bright except one that is dark. The electricity is not in that one. Sometimes you may meet some brothers who really respond to your fellowship concerning Christ. This is because they are in the apportioning of faith as you are, so you can react to one another. But you may meet some other brothers who are dull or who do not care much for Christ. They have faith, but they are short of the apportioning of faith. The only way to have this apportioning is by contacting the Lord.</p>
<p>Christianity has made itself in every way and in every thing a religion without the real contact with the Lord. They say they worship God, but actually they do not have the real worship. Their worship is only a kind of formality. In the Catholic Church they perform many rituals, but what the Bible shows us is a living Spirit. God is Spirit (John 4:24), and the last Person of the Godhead is Spirit (Matt. 28:19). The second Person of the Godhead became a man (John 1:14). Eventually, He was also pneumatized to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Thus, God is Spirit, the third Person is Spirit, and the second Person is pneumatized. So the Triune God is totally experienced and enjoyed through the Spirit. We must contact the Spirit day by day.</p>
<p>In these days the Lord has shown us the high peak of His revelation. But if we only see this high peak and do not touch the very God, the Triune, as the consummated Spirit, we are in doctrine. So day and night, every day, we have to contact the consummated Triune God as the compound, all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit. We must contact Him. When we contact Him, He is overflowing within us, and there is a mutuality of faith among us. Sometimes when we are enjoying the Lord in a meeting, we sing crazily in a living way. We sing this way because we have tasted and touched the living Lord. The religious people like to maintain their formality with everything in good order, but everyone who meets God becomes &ldquo;crazy.&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus entered into Jerusalem for the last time, the people became crazy in their praising, saying, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!&rdquo; (Matt. 21:9). When the chief priests and scribes heard this, they were indignant. &ldquo;They said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read, &lsquo;Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise&rsquo;?&rdquo; (v. 16). This shows that when we contact God, we will be excited and joyful in the Spirit in a living way. About thirty years ago, I saw an electrical toy boy who jumped when the electricity was turned on. Without the current of electricity, this toy was still, but when it was turned on, it became active. We should be such &ldquo;jumping toys,&rdquo; who are enjoying the divine electricity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">W. Faith, Hope, and Love</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 13:13 says, &ldquo;Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three.&rdquo; The top spiritual virtues are faith, hope, and love. Paul says the greatest one is love, but the first one is faith.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

Thank You that all the days You have been with us moment by moment. So we trust in You for the speaking and for the listening. Be our speaking and be our listening. We are not, but You are. Grant us the utterance, the up-to-date utterance, the new utterance, the instant and the constant utterance. Amen.</p>
<p>In this message we would like to fellowship three more points in our crystallization-study of the essence of the faith of the believers. This makes twenty-six points which we will have covered concerning faith.</p><h2 class="head2">X. Faith Being the First Issue<br />
of the Lord&rsquo;s Superabounding Grace</h2>
<p>First Timothy 1:14 says, &ldquo;And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Faith is the first issue of the Lord&rsquo;s superabounding grace. Now we need to see what this grace is.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Superabounding Grace of the Lord Being<br />
the Processed and Consummated Triune God<br />
to Be within Us Our Enjoyment of the Divine<br />
Unsearchable Riches in Christ</h2>
<p>We need to use a number of adjectives to describe grace. This grace is not only super but also abounding. Grace is superabounding. Romans 5:17 speaks of receiving the abundance of grace, and verse 21 speaks of grace reigning. John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace. Then verses 16 and 17 say, &ldquo;For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace...came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This superabounding grace is not some thing or matter but the Triune God Himself, the processed and consummated Triune God.</p>
<p>The Triune God&rsquo;s being processed and consummated is in the divine revelation of the Scriptures, but it is not in the theology of today&rsquo;s Christianity. God today is no more &ldquo;raw.&rdquo; God has been processed and consummated. To be processed means He has gone through, step by step, one process after another. His being consummated implies His attainment. After all the processes, He has been consummated, that is, He has attained to His completion. Before the Triune God was incarnated, He was only God, without humanity. But just about two thousand years ago, God became a man. Two thousand years in God&rsquo;s eyes is like two days (2 Pet. 3:8). Just about two days ago, the Triune God suddenly came into the womb of a virgin, and eventually God was born of her to be a man. This indicates strongly that our Triune God has been processed to become a man.</p>
<p>Furthermore, He passed through a long process of human living for thirty-three and a half years on this earth. What a wonder that God lived on this earth! He lived most of His life in the small town of Nazareth. I went there twice purposely to see where God lived, to see the streets where God walked. When I walked through Nazareth, I said, &ldquo;Lord, You are a Nazarene; I am too. I follow You.&rdquo; This was part of the process through which the Lord passed. He also passed through an all-inclusive death and an all-surpassing resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This processed Triune God is now within us to be the enjoyment in us of the divine unsearchable riches in Christ. Paul said he was a minister to minister the unsearchable riches of Christ to people (Eph. 3:8). These unsearchable riches today are the riches of the processed, consummated Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s<br />
Superabounding Grace Issues in<br />
All the Matters Related to the Divine Life</h2>
<p>When we enjoy the processed and consummated Triune God, this enjoyment issues in something. Even today, when you enjoy food, this enjoyment issues in something. Every day we eat three meals. After eating, we are full of strength, and this is the issue of our eating. The enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s superabounding grace issues in all the matters related to the divine life (Rom. 5:17, 21). It even issues in the kingship, so that we can be made kings. The overcomers will be in the thousand-year kingdom to be co-kings with Christ (Rev. 20:4, 6). Today we also are kings. The brothers are the real kings and the sisters are the real queens. We can say this based upon Romans 5:17 and 21. These verses tell us that those who receive the abundance of grace will reign in life and that grace can reign. Our being kings and queens is the superabounding, top issue of the enjoyment of the superabounding grace.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The First Issue Being Faith</h2>
<p>The first issue of the Lord&rsquo;s superabounding grace is faith that links us to the unsearchable riches of the Divine Trinity and which is the source of all the virtues of a believer (Eph. 3:17a). This is revealed in 2 Peter 1:5-8. Faith is the initial virtue. Then following faith come other virtues, until the issue reaches love. Faith is the first issue, and love is the last one.</p>
<p>At one time, we were sinners having no faith at all. But one day we heard the gospel. The sanctifying Spirit, the seeking Spirit, worked within us to show us Christ. He showed us how good and how gracious Christ is. That stirred up something within us to appreciate Christ. When we appreciated Christ a little bit, He entered into us as the superabounding grace. Then right away this Christ, the superabounding grace, issued first in faith. We wanted to believe in Him, making Him everything and putting ourselves away as nothing.</p>
<p>Soon after Christ came into me, I said, &ldquo;Lord, from today You are everything to me. I am nothing.&rdquo; This was our experience when we received Christ. From that day faith as the first issue of the superabounding grace became something so living in us in order to link us with the rich Triune God. The more we are linked, the more faith we have, and the more faith we have, the more enjoyment we have. This is the way for us to enjoy the processed and consummated Triune God&rsquo;s unsearchable riches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Y. Faith Being the Indicator of the Believers&rsquo; Life<br />
in the Enjoyment of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<p>We may say that we enjoy Christ and enjoy the Divine Trinity, but what kind of indication can people see in us of this enjoyment? Faith is the indicator of the believers&rsquo; life in the enjoyment of the Divine Trinity (1 Thes. 1:3, 5, 7-8; Rom. 1:8). Paul wrote a letter to the saints in Thessalonica, and he said that he remembered their work of faith. Their work of faith became such a strong factor in their lives that people everywhere were talking about their faith. This means that faith became a strong indicator of the Thessalonians&rsquo; enjoyment of the Divine Trinity. Paul said that they became a pattern to all the ones who believe in Christ. Their faith became such an indicator of their life in the enjoyment of Christ that they became a pattern to all the believing ones.</p>
<p><em>Those who believe</em> are <em>the believing ones.</em> We should try our best not to use the nickname <em>Christian</em> (see 1 Peter 4:16, note 1). Instead, we should use the name <em>believer</em>. I am a believer. There is a big difference between being a believer and being a mere Christian. There are millions of Christians today, but how many of these are believing ones? Quite often we may ask someone, &ldquo;Are you a Christian?&rdquo; The person may say that he is a Christian from a Christian family but that he is not like a Christian because he does not have faith. In his daily life, he is everything and he does everything. This is not faith. Faith is to believe that God is and I am not.</p>
<p>If you came to me to ask me if I am a Christian, I would say instead that I am a believer in Christ. There is a big difference between saying that you are a Christian and saying that you are a believer. There are many Christians who do not believe. But by God&rsquo;s mercy today, I believe. When we believe, this means that we believe God is everything and we are nothing. Today God does everything. I am doing nothing. Today my God, my Christ, is everything to me, and I become nothing. I work, but it is not I but Christ who works in me. Faith is the indicator of the believing ones who have God in Christ and nothing else.</p>
<p>In Christianity faith is for performing big careers. This is not only absolutely wrong but also absolutely devilish. Faith is not for performing any career. Faith is to live God and to annul yourself. You have to be annulled. How could you carry out some career for yourself? Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 said, &ldquo;If I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing&rdquo; (v. 2). Strictly speaking, with us, the believing ones, faith is not for us to accomplish careers, to accomplish a big work.</p>
<p>In the early days of my ministry, I heard quite often, &ldquo;You have so many people, but you don&rsquo;t do anything. You don&rsquo;t have a school, a hospital, or a university. What are you doing here?&rdquo; Actually, in a sense, we are doing nothing. Recently, someone asked me, &ldquo;Do you have some kind of plan?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brother, we never have any plan.&rdquo; Dear saints, especially the young ones, do not think that faith is for us to accomplish big things. Faith is for us to live God, to express God, and to minister God to people.</p>
<p>Many of the missions and denominations that came to China set up universities and hospitals. They did many works, but not many ministered Christ to others. Those in the Pentecostal movement say that if you have the faith, you can do great works. The Pentecostal movement began from the middle of the last century. But you cannot find a group of Pentecostal people who minister Christ as life to people. They promote the performance of miracles, but the apostle Paul did not do this. Paul said that he was sent to minister Christ in His unsearchable riches to people.</p>
<p>Right after I was saved, I was seeking to know the Bible. I met a Brethren group who knew the Bible, and I heard many of their teachings. Later, I met Brother Watchman Nee. I realized that Brother Nee&rsquo;s teaching was to minister Christ as life. He was not like the Brethren who ministered teachings, types, and prophecies. I learned a lot from them because they are good Bible teachers. But I never heard them give one message on Christ as life. Then when I met Brother Nee, I found out the difference. I am sharing this to impress us that faith is not for us to perform something. That is wrong.</p>
<p>After we moved to Anaheim, we began to be opposed, and I met with one of the leading opposers. He asked me how many people we had among us with doctor&rsquo;s degrees. I told him that we did not have many. He said that he had one hundred people with doctor&rsquo;s degrees working with him. His boast meant nothing. If it took a doctor&rsquo;s degree to serve the Lord in His ministry of life, then Peter, Paul, and even Jesus Himself would have been disqualified. None of them had any formal degree. Watchman Nee and I finished only the second year of a university. He studied at a school established by the British, and I studied at a school established by the American Presbyterians from Southern California. Neither of us had a degree.</p>
<p>Faith is not for us to perform something. Of course, in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, there is an amount of work. But we should not pay more attention to the work and less attention to life. If we do this, we are through. At Stanford all of the professors have a doctor&rsquo;s degree, but that is not the church. The church is composed of groups of &ldquo;fishermen.&rdquo; In 1 Corinthians 1:26-28 Paul said that in the church at Corinth there were &ldquo;not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many wellborn. But God has chosen the foolish things [men&mdash;the same in the following] of the world that He might shame those who are wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world that He might shame the things that are strong, and the lowborn things of the world and the despised things God has chosen, things which are not, that He might bring to nought the things which are.&rdquo; In 1943 we had a migration of seventy saints with their families from Chefoo to Inner Mongolia. Not one had even finished high school. Some of them were shoemakers. Eventually, within one winter, they turned more than forty Swedish China Inland Mission churches to the recovery. This is the operation of life.</p>
<p>Do not think you can do something, so you are somebody. You should say, &ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t want to be anybody, to be anything; You be my everything. You are, but I am not.&rdquo; This is faith. Within you there must be the indicator of this linking faith. When people contact you, they should see that there is a strong factor indicating that you are linked with God. Your faith must be an indicator to make you a pattern. Do not learn from anyone how to do things. That means nothing. But you have to learn of someone how to live God, how to live Christ, how to magnify Christ, and how to minister Christ to others. Dear saints, this is what we should have. Wherever we go and wherever we are, we should bear an indication that we are nothing, but God in Christ is everything to us. We should live such a life.</p>
<p>Faith is the indicator of the believers&rsquo; life in the enjoyment of the Divine Trinity. The faith of the Thessalonians was highly appraised by the apostle (1 Thes. 1:3). Their faith in its much assurance became an indicator of their abundant enjoyment of life in Christ (v. 5). You may perform big miracles, yet people cannot see in you any indication that you are an enjoyer of God. Both the Thessalonians&rsquo; and the Romans&rsquo; faith made them a pattern to the believing ones in Christ and became a part of the preaching of the believing ones in Christ (vv. 7-8; Rom. 1:8). In ancient times, they not only preached Christ but also preached the faith of the believing ones.</p><h2 class="head2">Z. The Linking Faith Being the Divine<br />
Requirement for the Overcomers to<br />
Meet Christ in His Triumphant Return</h2>
<p>The linking faith is the divine requirement for the overcomers to meet Christ in His triumphant return. This is based upon Luke 18:8, where the Lord said, &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?&rdquo; Today the entire world is unbelieving. Where is faith today among not only the Gentiles, the pagans, but also among the Jews, the Catholics, the Protestants, and the Pentecostal people? If the Lord came today, where could He find faith? Nearly no one on this earth is believing. But by His mercy, in the past years, through Brother Nee&rsquo;s leadership, we have been brought into a situation of learning not to trust in ourselves for anything, but to believe that our God is everything.</p>
<p>I hope that when the Lord comes back He can find you and me as the believing ones, who always trust in Him, not in ourselves, and who always have no assurance in ourselves. Our full assurance is in Him. This is the linking faith. This faith qualifies the overcomers. It is the divine requirement for you and me as the overcomers to meet Christ in His triumphant return.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Lord will find some, a small number of overcomers, who are living by the linking faith when He returns. In the ancient times, Elijah pleaded with God against Israel by saying, &ldquo;Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars; and I am left alone, and they are seeking my life&rdquo; (Rom. 11:3). Then the Lord told Elijah, &ldquo;I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal&rdquo; (v. 4). Look at today&rsquo;s world. It is hard to see any believing ones. But here and there some believing ones are hidden.</p>
<p>I believe that in comparison, there are more believing ones hidden in the recovery than in other places. People may say concerning us, &ldquo;They can do nothing. They only say, &lsquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah.&rsquo; When they come together they say, &lsquo;Lord Jesus, I love You. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Amen.&rsquo; This is all that they can do.&rdquo; This is because we are only for Christ Himself. We are not for big miracles, big works, or big careers. When the Lord comes back, He is expecting to find such people. Christ expects to find, at His coming back, the ones who live by the linking faith. Christ expects to find us as His hidden overcomers.</p>
<p>The believers who live an overcoming and exulting life by the linking faith will be found by Christ at His return as the treasures ready to receive the salvation of their souls as the end (result) of their faith (1 Pet. 1:8-9). In a sense, we do not know anything or do anything. We only know how to overcome and how to exult by the linking faith. Those who live by faith today will eventually receive the end of their faith, that is, the salvation of their souls. We have received a salvation, but this is just the initial salvation. The progressing stage of salvation is the stage of transformation. The completing stage of salvation is the stage of glorification. If we live by the linking faith in the progressing stage to be transformed, we will be kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>We are now making ourselves ready for that day. To make ourselves ready is to become an overcomer, who is always linked by the living faith with the Triune God. Every day, morning and evening, you have to say, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You that from morning to evening, I am linked to You. There is a living faith that links me with You so that I live You, walk with You, and live with You. I am one with You, just as You are one with me.&rdquo; This is the qualification for you to be an overcomer, to meet Christ at His coming back.</p>
<p>The overcomers will be rewarded by Christ with the co-kingship and the top enjoyment of the divine life with Him in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6). The Lord will then say to His overcomers, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave....Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (Matt. 25:21, 23). This is just like what J. N. Darby once said: &ldquo;O the joy of having nothing and being nothing, seeing nothing but a living Christ in glory, and being careful for nothing but His interests down here.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>The three points covered in this message are essentially crucial to a believer who lives the life of a Christ-pursuing God-man that he may be one of the overcomers whom the Lord desires to have for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy in the last days as the consummation of this age. Right after we have received Christ into us as our Savior and life by being attracted by Him, the divine grace, which is the consummated Triune God, begins to abound in us. The first issue of the abounding of the divine grace is the linking faith, which is the living God moving in us to link us to all His unsearchable riches. This linking faith is the measure according to which God dispenses into us His superabounding grace to meet our need (Rom. 12:3). Such a faith is the indicator of the living of the Christ-pursuing God-man, which is the real expression of the consummated God in Christ as His embodiment for the building up of the organic Body of Christ to be the organism of the consummated Triune God. So, such a faith constitutes the overcomers for the satisfaction of Christ&rsquo;s desire. Thus, this overcoming faith qualifies the Lord&rsquo;s overcomers, who are waiting for and eagerly expecting the coming back of the Lord, who will find them at His coming as men of His linking faith (Luke 18:8), as treasures for His kingdom in the thousand years of His reign.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate fulfillment of Romans 1:17, that &ldquo;the righteous shall have life and live by faith.&rdquo; The <em>righteous</em> shall have <em>life</em> and live by <em>faith!</em> This word should be the banner of God&rsquo;s eternal economy, which is altogether a matter in faith (1 Tim. 1:4)!</p>
<p>The righteous, those who are absolutely right before God and before man, shall have life, the divine life. Then, how can we, the vile sinners, have the divine life of the righteous God according to His righteousness? By faith! It is by faith, which is the moving and working God in Christ who puts us into Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30), that we, the sinners, have the divine life according to God&rsquo;s righteousness judicially. By this linking faith we are linked to God in Christ to participate in all that the all-inclusive Christ is, has, and has attained to, for the producing of the organic members of Christ to constitute and build up His organic Body, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the enlargement and expression of the eternal Triune God in His unlimited glory in the mysterious mingling of divinity with humanity for eternity (Rev. 21:2&mdash;22:5). This is the eternal fulfillment of the gospel in Romans 1:17, that &ldquo;the righteous shall have life and live by faith&rdquo;!</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

</ol>
<p>In this message we want to see the divine transfer of the believers from Adam to Christ. Praise the Lord that in the whole universe there is such a divine transfer of the believers. This is not like a transfer of furniture or office material from one place to another. This is a transfer of God&rsquo;s chosen people, who were chosen by God in eternity to be holy and who were predestinated in eternity unto His sonship (Eph. 1:4-5). These elect of God need a transfer because they became fallen from the proper position to another position. They need a transfer that will bring them out of their fallen position back to God&rsquo;s ordained position.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE BELIEVERS OF CHRIST BEING BORN IN ADAM</h2>
<p>We, the believers of Christ, were born in Adam in our natural birth with all his involvements. Adam fell before he begot any children. No child of Adam was born before Adam&rsquo;s fall, so everyone who is a descendant of Adam is in the fallen man. This is why all of us need a transfer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. IN ADAM</h2>
<p>In Adam, we were of the old creation and were fallen. We also became sinners before God with sin in our nature (Rom. 3:23; 7:17). Romans 7 deals with this matter strongly, telling us that in our flesh, nothing good dwells (v. 18).</p>
<p>We became dead in our spirit because of sin in our flesh (Eph. 2:1, 5; Col. 2:13). We became God&rsquo;s enemies by following God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan (Rom. 5:10a; 8:7; Eph. 2:2). We were in the kingdom of Satan under his authority of darkness (Matt. 12:26; Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18a). We were loving the world, which lies wholly in the evil one and of which Satan, the evil one, the enemy of God, is the ruler (1 John 2:15-16; 5:19b; John 12:31). Whatever you love outside of and apart from Christ&mdash;whether good or bad, high or low, moral or immoral&mdash; belongs to the world. If you love your spouse outside of Christ, your spouse becomes a part of the world. If you love your education or your car, these are also parts of the world. The world lies wholly in the evil one, Satan.</p>
<p>We were also condemned by God under His wrath (John 3:18b, 36b). In these recent years there have been terrible natural calamities in the United States. There have been a number of great floods. Do you have the assurance the flood will not come to your place or to your home? People ask, &ldquo;If God is love, why are there so many calamities on this earth?&rdquo; Today the newspapers are filled with reports of stealing, killing, and calamities. This is because the entire world is under God&rsquo;s wrath. Only God&rsquo;s mercy holds God back to give a margin of time for man on this earth to repent. We are still here in this margin of time, but we do not know how much longer it will last.</p>
<p>In Adam we were sentenced by God to die, to perish in the lake of fire forever (Heb. 9:27; John 3:16b; Rev. 21:8). This is man&rsquo;s destiny. This is why we need to give up the world and spend our time to preach the gospel to rescue fallen man from the lake of fire. Fanny Crosby, a sister who lived in the last century, wrote many hymns. One of these hymns (<em>Hymns,</em> #921) is concerning rescuing the perishing sinners. The first stanza and chorus of this hymn say:</p>
<p class="hbody">Rescue the perishing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care for the dying,<br />
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep o&rsquo;er the erring one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift up the fallen,<br />
Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.</p>
<p class="hbody">Rescue the perishing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care for the dying;<br />
Jesus is merciful,<br />
Jesus will save.</p>
<p>We should be inspired by this matter. All the people on this earth are busy doing many things, but eventually they will perish. We need to have a heart to rescue the perishing, to care for the dying.</p>
<p>Due to our fall in Adam, we became flesh, not being subject to the law of God, unable to please God, and having no possibility of being justified by God (Gen. 6:3a; Rom. 8:7-8; Gal. 2:16b). We were walking according to the age of this world and according to the ruler of the authority of the air in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh, being the children of wrath by nature (Eph. 2:2-3).</p>
<p>The modern course of the world is an age. In the United States, it seems that nearly every decade is an age. The size and style of men&rsquo;s ties have varied over the years. About thirty years ago, the ties were very wide. Then they gradually became narrower. All the modern styles match a particular modern age, the course of the world. We were walking according to the age of this world. This was the position we were in before we got saved. Thus, we needed a great transfer. This divine transfer is the totality of all the items of God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation. God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation is the transfer. This dynamic salvation rescues us from everything in Adam.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE DIVINE TRANSFER IN REGENERATION</h2>
<p>We are regenerated in Christ in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3); in this rebirth the divine transfer takes place and transfers us out of Adam into Christ. Through regeneration God transferred us. Once we were in Adam, but today we are in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. IN CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Chosen to Be Holy and<br />
Predestinated unto Sonship</h2>
<p>We were chosen by God the Father to be holy to partake of His holy nature and predestinated unto sonship to possess His divine life (Eph. 1:4-5). We participate in the holy nature of God and the divine life of God. We need to realize that our position is crucial. If we are in Adam, we are finished. If we are in Christ, we have God&rsquo;s nature and possess God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Judicially Redeemed, Forgiven, Justified,<br />
and Reconciled to God</h2>
<p>We are judicially redeemed, forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God (Eph. 1:7; Rom. 3:24; 5:10a). All of this took place according to God&rsquo;s righteous, legal requirements, so it is judicial.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Organically Regenerated</h2>
<p>We are organically regenerated to be the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ, for the constitution of the church, the Body of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:14, 29; Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 12:5). We are the sons of God and the brothers of Christ for an organism to satisfy the Triune God. This organism is the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Sanctified by the Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>We are sanctified by the Spirit of life with the element of the divine nature (Rom. 15:16), renewed from the oldness of our old man by the Spirit of life (Rom. 12:2b; Titus 3:5), transformed by the Lord Spirit with the life element of Christ (Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 3:18), conformed through transformation in life to the image of the firstborn Son of God, making us the many God-men, the mass reproduction of Christ the God-man, the prototype (Rom. 8:29), and glorified to be completely redeemed in our body, the framework of our entire being, for the full enjoyment of our divine sonship (Rom. 8:30, 23). We have received the divine nature, but the divine nature has to work within us by the Spirit of life to sanctify us into God&rsquo;s holiness. Being holy is connected to God&rsquo;s nature. If we do not have the divine nature of God, we can never be holy. God&rsquo;s divine nature is the element of sanctification, and this element is wrought into our being by the Spirit. Then gradually we become holy as God is in His nature. Thus, we become God in His nature and in His life, but not in His Godhead. Regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification are the steps which accomplish the very great career on this earth of making man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. This is for the full enjoyment of our divine sonship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Delivered out of the Evil Kingdom of Satan</h2>
<p>We are delivered out of the evil kingdom of Satan, that is, the authority of darkness (Col. 1:13a), freed from the warring, subduing, and killing power of sin (Rom. 6:7; 7:11, 17-23), freed from the yoke of slavery of the law (Gal. 5:1), and freed from the vanity of the old creation and the slavery of corruption (Rom. 8:20-21). We are fighting with sin, so there is a war going on, raging all the time. Sin is warring against us, subduing us, and killing us. But in Christ, we are freed from this sin. We are also freed from the yoke of slavery of the law. The law decreed by God through Moses enslaves us. Only in Christ can we be freed from that slavery.</p>
<p>We are freed from the vanity of the old creation. This is Paul&rsquo;s expression in Romans 8. The old creation is vanity. Eventually, the entire old creation will pass away. This is why Solomon said that everything under the sun on this earth is vanity of vanities (Eccl. 1:2). Whatever we have is a part of the world, the world is the old creation, and the old creation is vanity. But in Christ we have been freed from this vanity. Today we are no longer in vanity. The world, the old creation, is vanity, and Christ is the reality. We are also freed in Christ from the slavery of corruption. Everything in the world is under corruption. Every new thing eventually decays. That is the slavery of corruption. To become old is a part of the slavery of corruption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Made a Royal Priesthood and a Holy Nation</h2>
<p>We are made a royal priesthood and a holy nation (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9), the overcomers over Satan (Rev. 12:11), the overcomers over the world (1 John 5:5), more than conquerors over the environmental troubles (Rom. 8:35-39), and the kings to reign in the eternal life forever (Rom. 5:17, 21). This is all in Christ.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

<li>The Spirit of God, as the Third of the Divine Trinity, was the Spirit of God in God&rsquo;s creation (Gen. 1:2), the Spirit of Jehovah in God&rsquo;s contact with man (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29), and the Holy Spirit in the preparation for the incarnation of Christ as the embodiment of God (Luke 1:15, 35; Matt. 1:18).</li>
<p>Note: In the New Testament <em>the Holy Spirit</em> is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God. Such a title is not used in the Old Testament. In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11, <em>Holy Spirit</em> should be translated &ldquo;Spirit of holiness.&rdquo;</p>
<li>Before the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit of God had only divinity, without humanity.</li>
<li>John 7:39 says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified&rdquo;:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word here unveils to us a very strange aspect concerning the Spirit of God; that is, before His glorification, before His resurrection (Luke 24:26), &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; was not yet, even though the Third of the Divine Trinity as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit was there already. This indicates that, after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Holy Spirit has become &ldquo;the Spirit,&rdquo; who is different from what He was before the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection.</li>
	<li>Through and in the resurrection of Christ, the Holy Spirit has become &ldquo;the Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:19b). Jesus Christ is the God-man; He is both divine and human; hence, the Spirit of Jesus Christ must possess both the element of divinity and the element of humanity. Andrew Murray saw this divine revelation. In chapter five, on the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, of his masterpiece entitled <em>The Spirit of Christ,</em> Andrew Murray says:</li>
	<li>&ldquo;...The Son, who had from eternity been with the Father, entered upon a new stage of existence when He became flesh. When He returned to Heaven, He was still the same only-begotten Son of God, and yet not altogether the same. For He was now also, as Son of Man, the first-begotten from the dead, clothed with that glorified humanity which He had perfected and sanctified for Himself. And just so the Spirit of God as poured out at Pentecost was indeed something new....When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the Incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus....</li>
	<li>&ldquo;This thought opens up to us further the reason why it is not the Spirit of God as such, but the Spirit of Jesus, that could be sent to dwell in us....Christ came...to bring human nature itself again into the fellowship of the Divine life, to make us partakers of the Divine nature....In His own person, having become flesh, He had to sanctify the flesh, and make it a meet and willing receptacle for the indwelling of the Spirit of God....From His nature, as it was glorified in the resurrection and ascension, His Spirit came forth as the Spirit of His human life, glorified into the union with the Divine, to make us partakers of all that He had personally wrought out and acquired, of Himself and His glorified life....And in virtue of His having perfected in Himself a new holy human nature on our behalf, He could now communicate what previously had no existence&mdash;a life at once human and Divine....</li>
	<li>&ldquo;...In our place, and on our behalf, as man and the Head of man, He was admitted into the full glory of the Divine, and His human nature constituted the receptacle and the dispenser of the Divine Spirit. And the Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man&mdash;most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man....He can now come down to witness of the perfect union of the Divine and the human, and in becoming our life, to make us partakers of it....</li>
	<li>&ldquo;...The Holy Spirit descends as a Person to dwell in believers, and to make the glorified Jesus a Present Reality within them....&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Now the Spirit of Jesus Christ is not only the Spirit of divinity but also the Spirit of humanity. He, as the Spirit of God, has been compounded with divinity and humanity. Hence, He is the compounded Spirit.</li>
	<li>In typology, the type of the holy anointing ointment, as unveiled in Exodus 30:23-28, confirms this divine revelation concerning the Spirit of God. That type shows us that the Spirit of God is compounded not only with the divinity of God (typified by a hin of olive oil) and the humanity of man (typified by the four kinds of spices) but also with the sweet death of Christ (typified by myrrh), the sweet effectiveness of the death of Christ (typified by cinnamon), the surpassing resurrection of Christ (typified by calamus), and the repelling power of the resurrection of Christ (typified by cassia). Such a compound was called the holy anointing ointment with which all the tabernacle and its utensils were anointed for their sanctification unto God, and such a compounded Spirit is the anointing Spirit as the sealing Spirit (2 Cor. 1:21-22), whose anointing within the believers is the reality of His indwelling within the believers (1 John 2:20, 27).</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>In this message we want to speak concerning the wonderful Spirit in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. According to our study of the New Testament, the most important thing is this wonderful Spirit. Nothing in the entire Bible is so important, yet this wonderful Spirit has nearly been put aside by today&rsquo;s Christians.</p>
<p>The Spirit is first mentioned in Genesis 1:2. In God&rsquo;s creation, the Spirit of God was brooding over the death waters. The more the Bible goes on, the more the Spirit is mentioned. When we come to the last section of the biblical books, the Epistles, the Spirit is mentioned frequently. Revelation is also an Epistle, which is compounded with seven single epistles (chs. 2&mdash;3). Only five books of the New Testament are not Epistles: the four Gospels and Acts. Afterward, the first Epistle is Romans and the last one is Revelation, with the epistles to the seven churches. Nearly every page of the Epistles speaks of the Spirit. In the first part of Romans 8 the Spirit is mentioned in nearly every verse.</p>
<p>In Genesis 1 the Spirit of God is mentioned in a very simple way. He was brooding over the death waters. The last time the Spirit is mentioned is in the last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22. There the Spirit is mentioned in such a marvelous way: &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say...&rdquo; (v. 17a). At the beginning of the Bible, the Spirit was with the dark, deep waters. At the end of the Bible, the Spirit is with a bride!</p>
<p>The Spirit is the most important matter unveiled in the Bible. The whole Bible is a revelation of God, and God is Spirit (John 4:24). Not only so, God is triune (Matt. 28:19). The Third of the Divine Trinity, the Spirit, is neither the ending nor the commencement, but the consummation. The consummation, the totality, the aggregate, of the Divine Trinity is the Spirit. God is Spirit, and the consummation, the aggregate, of the Divine Trinity is also the Spirit. Furthermore, the Triune God is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9), and the Son becomes eventually the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Thus, God is Spirit; the consummation of the Divine Trinity is the Spirit; and the Second of the Divine Trinity, who is the embodiment of the Divine Trinity, also became a Spirit. Eventually, this Spirit becomes the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).</p>
<p>In Genesis 1, at the very beginning of the Bible, the Spirit of God was there. Later, the Spirit of Jehovah was there (Judg. 3:10). Then, the New Testament begins with the Holy Spirit for the incarnation of Christ (Matt. 1:18). Yet John 7 says that the Spirit was not yet (v. 39). The Spirit of God was there in Genesis 1. The Spirit of God as the Spirit of Jehovah was there throughout the entire Old Testament. Then the Spirit of God as the Holy Spirit was there to accomplish the wonderful incarnation through which God became man. Such an important thing transpired through the Spirit of God. Yet when we come to John 7, during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</p>
<p>This short phrase&mdash;&ldquo;the Spirit was not yet&rdquo;&mdash;has bothered all the proper translators of the New Testament and the careful students and teachers of the theology of the Bible. Jesus as a man was born of the Spirit. He was conceived of the Spirit. But after thirty years, when Jesus was speaking in His ministry, John 7 says that the Spirit was not yet. It is difficult for people to explain this. Many have been bound, frustrated, limited, covered, and blinded by their kind of traditional, fundamental teaching. For many years we were puzzled about this matter. But we were desperate to dive into the depths of the truth in our study of the Bible. Thank God that He gave us the answer.</p>
<p>John 7:39 says that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified. The glorification of Jesus was the uplifting of Jesus&rsquo; humanity into divinity in His resurrection. The Spirit was not yet because Jesus&rsquo; humanity had not yet been uplifted into divinity in His resurrection. In the first part of the Bible, the Spirit of God had only divinity without humanity. But in the last part of the Bible, the Spirit is unveiled as the Spirit of life who has both divinity and humanity. Thus, to say that the Spirit was not yet means that the Spirit of both divinity and humanity was not yet. But after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, when Christ had uplifted His humanity into His divinity, the Spirit became something more. After Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the Spirit was not merely the Spirit of God possessing divinity only, but the Spirit of both God and man, possessing both divinity and humanity.</p>
<p>Many in traditional theology say that the Holy Spirit of God possesses only divinity. They say that the Spirit of God is not the Spirit of man. They do not see how He could possess humanity. But the Bible eventually unveils to us that the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the God-man. This God-man is Jesus. <em>Hymns,</em> #242 says that the Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Jesus. Jesus is a God-man. So the Spirit of Jesus is now possessing not only divinity, but both divinity and humanity. The Spirit of God today is the Spirit of the man Jesus.</p>
<p>Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. What kind of Spirit has the bountiful supply? Not the Spirit of God only, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the God-man. Many Christians today are poor because they are short of this supply. The Bible says that the Spirit of Jesus Christ has a bountiful supply because He is the Spirit of both God and of the man Jesus. Thus, He becomes the compound Spirit. The Spirit of God is now compounded with man. At one time, He had only one element, the divine element, without the human element. But in His resurrection, Christ has uplifted His humanity into His divinity. Now the Spirit of God has become the Spirit of a God-man, possessing the divine nature and human nature. So He is no longer a simple Spirit, but a compounded Spirit, a Spirit compounded with God and with man. This is our crystallization-study of the Spirit. In the New Testament, the main title of the Spirit of God is <em>the Spirit of life.</em> This is referred to in Romans 8:2.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THE SPIRIT OF JEHOVAH,<br />
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Spirit of God, as the Third of the Divine Trinity, was the Spirit of God in God&rsquo;s creation (Gen. 1:2), the Spirit of Jehovah in God&rsquo;s contact with man (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29), and the Holy Spirit in the preparation for the incarnation of Christ as the embodiment of God (Luke 1:15, 35; Matt. 1:18). In the New Testament the Holy Spirit is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God. Such a title is not used in the Old Testament. In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11, <em>Holy Spirit</em> should be translated &ldquo;Spirit of holiness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BEFORE THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST,<br />
THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAVING ONLY DIVINITY,<br />
WITHOUT HUMANITY</h2>
<p>Before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the Spirit of God possessed only divinity, not humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. &ldquo;THE SPIRIT WAS NOT YET, BECAUSE<br />
JESUS HAD NOT YET BEEN GLORIFIED&rdquo;</h2>
<p>John 7:39 says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Very Strange Aspect<br />
concerning the Spirit of God</h2>
<p>The word in John 7:39 unveils to us a very strange aspect concerning the Spirit of God; that is, before His glorification, before His resurrection (Luke 24:26), &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; was not yet, even though the Third of the Divine Trinity as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit was there already. This indicates that, after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Holy Spirit has become &ldquo;the Spirit,&rdquo; who is different from what He was before the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. In this point our understanding of the Holy Spirit according to the divine revelation differs from the understanding of Christianity according to their traditional fundamental teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Spirit of Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Through and in the resurrection of Christ, the Holy Spirit has become &ldquo;the Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:19b). Jesus Christ is the God-man; He is both divine and human; hence, the Spirit of Jesus Christ must possess both the element of divinity and the element of humanity. Andrew Murray saw this divine revelation. We would like to quote from chapter five, concerning the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, of his masterpiece entitled <em>The Spirit of Christ.</em> Please note that our own commentary on what Andrew Murray has said is enclosed in brackets.</p>
<p>...The Son, who had from eternity been with the Father, entered upon a new stage of existence when He became flesh. When He returned to Heaven, He was still the same only-begotten Son of God, and yet not altogether the same. For He was now also, as Son of Man, the first-begotten from the dead, clothed with that glorified humanity which He had perfected and sanctified for Himself. [This is what I call the uplifted humanity. His humanity was not only glorified, perfected, and sanctified, but also uplifted from the human level to the divine level.] And just so the Spirit of God as poured out at Pentecost was indeed something new....[After Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, on the day of Pentecost the Spirit became something new.] When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the Incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus....</p>
<p>[Andrew Murray used the word <em>interwoven.</em> I use the word <em>mingled</em> (Lev. 2:4-5). The truth concerning mingling was taught by the church fathers in the second century. But later theologians condemned this term because of some who heretically said that Christ&rsquo;s humanity and divinity were mingled together to produce a third nature. But the proper definition of <em>mingling</em> according to <em>Webster&rsquo;s Third New International Dictionary</em> is, &ldquo;To bring or combine together or with something else so that the components remain distinguishable in the combination.&rdquo; In other words, two things are mingled together as one entity, but their separate natures remain the same, without the producing of a third nature. Andrew Murray saw the same thing, but he used the word <em>interwoven,</em> as in a textile, instead of the word <em>mingled</em> as used in the type of the meal offering in Leviticus 2:4-5.]</p>
<p class="indent1">This thought opens up to us further the reason why it is not the Spirit of God as such, but the Spirit of Jesus, that could be sent to dwell in us....Christ came...to bring human nature itself again into the fellowship of the Divine life, to make us partakers of the Divine nature....[This is spoken of in 2 Peter 1:4, which says that we are partakers of the divine nature.] In His own person, having become flesh, He had to sanctify the flesh, and make it a meet and willing receptacle for the indwelling of the Spirit of God....From His nature, as it was glorified in the resurrection and ascension, His Spirit came forth as the Spirit of His human life, glorified into the union with the Divine, to make us partakers of all that He had personally wrought out and acquired, of Himself and His glorified life....And in virtue of His having perfected in Himself a new holy human nature [the uplifted humanity] on our behalf, He could now communicate what previously had no existence&mdash;a life at once human and Divine....</p>
<p class="indent1">[Thus, we see that Jesus is God mingled with man, the God-man, and His Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who possesses both the human nature and the divine nature.]</p>
<p class="indent1">...In our place, and on our behalf, as man and the Head of man, He was admitted into the full glory of the Divine, and His human nature constituted the receptacle and the dispenser of the Divine Spirit. And the Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man&mdash;most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man....He can now come down to witness of the perfect union of the Divine and the human, and in becoming our life, to make us partakers of it....</p>
<p class="indent1">...The Holy Spirit descends as a Person to dwell in believers, and to make the glorified Jesus a Present Reality within them.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Spirit of Divinity<br />
and the Spirit of Humanity</h2>
<p>Now the Spirit of Jesus Christ is not only the Spirit of divinity but also the Spirit of humanity. He, as the Spirit of God, has been compounded with divinity and humanity. Hence, He is the compounded Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Type of the Holy Anointing Ointment</h2>
<p>In typology, the type of the holy anointing ointment, as unveiled in Exodus 30:23-28, confirms this divine revelation concerning the Spirit of God. Some of the Brethren teachers saw that this anointing ointment typified the Spirit of God, but they did not see the significance of the type of the compounded Spirit in Exodus 30. That type shows us that the Spirit of God is compounded not only with the divinity of God (typified by a hin of olive oil) and the humanity of man (typified by the four kinds of spices), but also with the sweet death of Christ (typified by myrrh), the sweet effectiveness of the death of Christ (typified by cinnamon), the surpassing resurrection of Christ (typified by calamus), and the repelling power of the resurrection of Christ (typified by cassia). Such a compound was called the holy anointing ointment with which all the tabernacle and its utensils were anointed for their sanctification unto God, and such a compounded Spirit is the anointing Spirit as the sealing Spirit (2 Cor. 1:21-22), whose anointing within the believers is the reality of His indwelling within the believers (1 John 2:20, 27). The one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God and the four spices signify man as the head of the creatures. Here we see the mingling of God and man. (For more details concerning the type of the compound ointment, see <em>Life-study of Exodus,</em> Messages 157-166, pp. 1679-1776.)</p>
<p>This is a very significant point missed by today&rsquo;s Christianity concerning the Holy Spirit. Those in today&rsquo;s Christianity have never seen that the Spirit of God through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection was compounded with divinity and humanity. Through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Man compounded with four things: Christ&rsquo;s death, the sweet effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and the repelling power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Thus, in the Spirit there is the killing element that puts everything of the old creation to death (Rom. 8:11). Also, in the Spirit there is a repelling power. In ancient times, people used cassia as a snake and insect repellent. After the olive oil was compounded with the four kinds of spices, it became an ointment. An ointment is a compound. Therefore, the Spirit of God today is a compound! <em>Consummation</em> equals <em>compound</em>. This is why we say that the Spirit today is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</p>
<p>Now we would like to list the different functions of the anointing of the compound Spirit as God&rsquo;s anointing ointment (Exo. 30:25; 1 John 2:27; 2 Cor. 1:21):</p>

<p>The Bible is a book that unveils God to us, and this God is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This Triune God came into time to pass through a long process of four major steps: incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. Through this process He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and this life-giving Spirit, according to the type in Exodus 30, is a compound Spirit, a Spirit compounded with God and man and with four items concerning Christ: His death, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection. He is now the compound Spirit, so He is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Triune God who has passed through a long process of four steps has become a compound, and this compound is a living person, the Spirit of life. Within Him are these six things&mdash;God and man, Christ&rsquo;s death and its effectiveness, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and its power. All these are compounded into one entity, which is called the anointing ointment.</p>
<p>This compound, the anointing ointment, the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, has become a medicine to us. It has the supplying element. It also has the killing, repelling element. So eventually the entire Bible presents us an all-inclusive dose which we need. If we receive this dose, we receive God, and we become God-men. This dose supplies us, nourishes us, and kills all the germs within us to make us a healthy, heavenly God-man, and this God-man is altogether in resurrection. Resurrection is the equivalent of the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Bible presents us a dose, and this dose is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

	<li>This compound Spirit, as the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), carries out the dynamic salvation of God organically in regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation, as we have seen in the past messages.

</ol>
<p>In this message we want to see more concerning the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). <em>The Spirit of life</em> is a particular, extraordinary title given to the Spirit of God in the New Testament economy. In the Old Testament economy, the Spirit of God was just the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah. But in the New Testament economy, the Spirit of God has become much more.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Compound Spirit Carrying Out<br />
the Dynamic Salvation of God</h2>
<p>The compound Spirit, as the Spirit of life, carries out the dynamic salvation of God organically in regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation, as we have seen in the past messages. Regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation are the five major steps of God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation. In all these aspects the all-inclusive Spirit, as the life-giving Spirit, gives, imparts, dispenses, and distributes the divine life into the believers. This becomes the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ for the believers to live Christ and magnify Christ (Phil. 1:19-21) and to practice the church life as unveiled in the last five chapters of Romans concerning the Body of Christ and the local churches. This is evidenced by Romans 14:17, which says that the righteousness, peace, and joy of such an all-inclusive Spirit are the reality of the kingdom of God in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Seven Spirits of God</h2>
<p>Such an all-inclusive Spirit, as the Spirit of life, becomes the seven Spirits of God in the dark age of the church in its degradation (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). The compound Spirit was consummated to produce the Body of Christ, the church. But when the church becomes degraded in this dark age, this compound Spirit becomes seven Spirits. The seven Spirits of God are the one Spirit in His sevenfold intensification. This is like the Triune God. He is not three Gods, but one God who is threefold. In the same way, the one Spirit is now sevenfold. The sevenfold Spirit is to make the faithful followers of Jesus Christ the overcomers.</p>
<p>We may have the boldness to admit that we are the faithful followers of Jesus, but whether or not we can be counted as overcomers in God&rsquo;s eyes, we dare not say. The One who can make us the overcomers is the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Both the sevenfold Spirit and the overcomers are unveiled by the Lord in Revelation. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is for the overcomers. We can never be overcomers by our own strength or effort.</p>
<p>The faithful followers of Jesus have to declare that they overcome their accuser, Satan, not by their own overcoming but by the blood of the Lamb (Rev. 12:11). Every morning I have the strong intention to overcome. But every day before going to bed I have to confess, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I cannot stand before You by my overcoming. Neither can I overcome my adversary, my accuser, by my own merit. Lord, I can stand before You only by the blood of the Lamb. And I can stand against Your enemy and my accuser only by the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo; When we try to overcome, we still make mistakes. Quite often we are not overcomers, but defeated ones. Then we may ask, &ldquo;How can we be overcomers?&rdquo; The Lord says we overcome because of the blood of the Lamb. Do not believe that by doing your best you can succeed in overcoming. Paul said that although he could not find anything wrong with himself, he could not justify himself until the Lord comes (1 Cor. 4:4-5). We have to realize that we always need the blood of Christ and that it is by the sevenfold intensified Spirit that we become overcomers.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation shows that we are to overcome the legality of Judaism, the apostasy of Catholicism, the deadness of Protestantism, and the lukewarmness of the Brethren that we may close the present age of the church. This is clearly unveiled in Revelation 2&mdash;3.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Processed Spirit</h2>
<p>This processed Spirit, who has been processed through the incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection of Christ, eventually becomes the realization of Christ, the application of the pneumatized Christ, the pneumatic Christ in the believers&rsquo; experience of Him, and the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God as the reality of the divine resurrection of Christ in God&rsquo;s new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Processed All-inclusive Spirit<br />
Marrying the Redeemed, Regenerated,<br />
Transformed, and Glorified Tripartite Man</h2>
<p>The processed all-inclusive Spirit, as the processed and consummated Triune God, marries the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man, and they send a proclamation, as the proclamation of the consummated Triune God with His bride, the church, to the ones who are thirsty for the water of life (Rev. 22:17). The two become a universal couple to be the union of God and man, a mutual habitation of God and man, and the expression of the mingling of God and man in its expansion as the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">I. The Nicene Creed Being Fundamental,<br />
but Not Complete</h2>
<p>Today many Christians appreciate the Nicene Creed, put forth at the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325. This creed is still recited weekly on Sunday morning in many places. The Nicene Creed is fundamental and scriptural, but it is not complete. This is because it does not cover the five following major points.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. &ldquo;The Spirit Was Not Yet&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Nicene Creed does not mention John 7:39, which says that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. &ldquo;The Last Adam Became a Life-giving Spirit&rdquo;</h2>
<p>After I came to the United States thirty-two years ago, I was filled with the burden to speak concerning Christ as the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In 1963 I wrote some hymns in our hymnal which declare this truth (<em>Hymns,</em> #493, #539, #745).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. &ldquo;The Lord Is the Spirit,&rdquo;<br />
the Transforming Spirit</h2>
<p>The Nicene Creed does not point out that &ldquo;the Lord is the Spirit,&rdquo; the transforming Spirit, as mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:17-18.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Compound Spirit</h2>
<p>Another great item missed by the Nicene Creed is the compound Spirit, compounded with Christ&rsquo;s divinity and His humanity and with His sweet death, the sweet effectiveness of His death, and His all-conquering resurrection with its repelling power (Exo. 30:23-28). No one can deny that there is such a type in the book of Exodus, accompanying the type of the tabernacle, with the altar, the laver, the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark. In Christianity there are interpretations of these things, but none of the writers of Christianity has ever fully touched the type of the holy anointing ointment. They have missed the truth concerning the compound Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Sevenfold Intensified Spirit</h2>
<p>The fifth major point missed by the Nicene Creed is the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).</p>
<p>Now we can see that in the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, the Spirit of God is unveiled in stage after stage. The first mention of the Spirit of God is in Genesis 1:2, which says that the Spirit was brooding over the dark waters. The Spirit of God is God Himself. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;God is Spirit&rdquo; (John 4:24). The Spirit is the very essence of God, the very reality of God. So when the Bible unveils the Spirit of God, that means the Bible unveils God to us.</p>
<p>The first stage of the revelation of the Spirit is the Spirit of God. Then the last stage is in Revelation 22:17, which speaks of &ldquo;the Spirit.&rdquo; In the Old Testament, there are the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah. In the New Testament, there are the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Eventually, at the end of the Bible there is only &ldquo;the Spirit.&rdquo; The title <em>the Spirit</em> is mentioned the first time in John 7:39, which says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified [resurrected].&rdquo; But at the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit was consummated to be the life-giving Spirit. Thus, at the end of the Bible there is &ldquo;the Spirit.&rdquo; Concerning the Spirit of God as revealed in the holy Scripture, &ldquo;the Spirit of God&rdquo; is at the beginning, and &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; is at the end.</p>
<p>When the Bible speaks of the resurrection of Christ, it says that in resurrection this very Christ who was the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became the Spirit who gives life to us (2 Cor. 3:6b) and transforms us (vv. 17-18), the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This life-giving Spirit is the issue of a man in the flesh who was called the last Adam. The last Adam is Jesus Christ, so the life-giving Spirit is the equivalent of Christ. Christ is God&rsquo;s embodiment in man (Col. 2:9), and this Christ became the life-giving Spirit. Christ is the equivalent of God plus man, and the life-giving Spirit is the equivalent of Christ. Thus, no doubt, this life-giving Spirit is a compound Spirit&mdash;a Spirit of both God and man.</p>
<p>The compound Spirit is compounded not only with God and man, but also with Christ&rsquo;s death, the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. So this compound Spirit is a compound of six elements: the divine element, the human element, the death element, the effectiveness element, the resurrection element, and the power element. Eventually, this compound Spirit becomes the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</p>
<p>This Spirit is the very Triune God who has been processed and consummated! He is the realization of Christ, who is God embodied in man. He is also the reality of Christ, the application of the pneumatized Christ, and the very pneumatic Christ in our experience of Christ. Thus, this life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, the sevenfold Spirit, is altogether the Triune God Himself in many aspects. The Bible unveils all this. The Bible unveils who God is. Our God is the Triune God becoming a man to be Christ; Christ in His resurrection became the life-giving Spirit; and the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God embodied in a man. Today the life-giving Spirit is everything to us.</p>
<p>God, man, Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, and the sevenfold intensified Spirit are one thing. They are all resurrection. The reality of resurrection is the life-giving Spirit, the life-giving Spirit is the realization of Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God in man. Today we are in resurrection. When we are in resurrection, we are in the life-giving, compound, sevenfold intensified Spirit. When we are in resurrection, we are in the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ, Christ Himself. When we are in resurrection, we are in the processed and consummated Triune God.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

<p>In this message we want to fellowship concerning the human spirit of the believers. In the previous two messages we saw the truth concerning the Spirit of life. God&rsquo;s move in His eternal economy is altogether wrapped up with the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. Not only so, such a life-giving Spirit is the completion of God&rsquo;s economy. Without such a Spirit, God&rsquo;s economy has no way to be completed. So we must pay our full attention to the Spirit of life, who is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy is to gain man and make man the same as He is for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ. This is the goal: the organic Body of Christ. What God wants, what God desires, is only the organic Body of Christ in which God has constituted Himself with humanity. Do not care for today&rsquo;s Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. All these religions are counterfeit. They not only confiscate what God wants but also have become and still are veils upon people. Thus, people cannot see that the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy is the organic Body of Christ. It is fully unveiled in the holy Scriptures with sixty-six books, but Satan uses Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism to veil the teachers of the Bible.</p>
<p>For example, the term <em>economy of God</em> is clearly unveiled by Paul&rsquo;s writing. In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to do one thing. This was to charge certain teachers not to teach things different from the economy of God. Timothy was to charge them not to teach things about the law, genealogies, or myths fabricated by the rabbis. We are to teach just one thing: the economy of God. Whoever reads 1 Timothy 1:3-4 should ask what the economy of God is, because this is the top thing concerning which Paul exhorted Timothy. Thank the Lord that over the past thirty years, the merciful Lord has opened our eyes to see God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 speaks of the economy of the fullness of the times. Then in Ephesians 3 Paul said that he received grace, as one who was less than the least among the saints, to minister the unsearchable riches of Christ to people for the church to come into existence and to enlighten all that they might see what the economy of the mystery is (vv. 8-11). What a great light this is! The Lord&rsquo;s servants should not be just teachers, teaching people the Bible, or pastors, pastoring a flock. But every one should be a minister, ministering not doctrines but the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.</p>
<p>We need to realize that Satan hates the high peak of the divine revelation concerning the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s economy. He hates this one main point&mdash;that God became a man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead to produce the organic Body of Christ for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy to close this age and to bring Christ back to set up His kingdom. This is why we need prayer for fighting the spiritual warfare for the release of these messages. Today where is the Body of Christ on this earth? Today who understands and ministers and practices the Body of Christ? This is altogether something new. God purposely in His incarnation became a man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead for the producing of the organic Body of Christ to fulfill God&rsquo;s economy to close this age and to bring Christ back with His kingdom. All these crystallization messages are for this purpose. They are for the producing of the church life, the Body life.</p>
<p>Today we have to know our mingled spirit and to exercise our spirit. This mingled spirit is the unique organ for God to bring forth and build up the Body of Christ. The center of God&rsquo;s creation was His forming a spirit within man. Zechariah 12:1 and Isaiah 42:5 indicate that the spirit of man should be ranked with the heavens and the earth. According to the concept of the prophets, there are only three big things in the universe besides God. God, of course, is the biggest. Besides God there are the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</p>
<p>The heavens are for the earth. The rain, sunshine, and fresh air from the heavens are for the earth to grow things. Then the earth is for man. The vegetable life, animal life, and minerals of the earth are for man&rsquo;s existence. Man&rsquo;s physical body is constituted with these things. Our body is made of the dust of the earth and is constituted with minerals such as copper, iron, and sulphur. For such a dusty body to live, the earth is needed. Thus, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and finally, man is for God. In order for man to be for God, man needs a spirit. Man is physical, dusty, but God is not. God is Spirit, so man needs a spirit to contact God. This is why God created man in a very particular way by making a spirit for man. For God&rsquo;s fulfillment of His eternal economy, three things are the greatest: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</p><h2 class="head1">I. MAN BEING CREATED BY GOD IN THREE PARTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Body Made of Dust as Man&rsquo;s Outward Shell,<br />
the Framework of Man</h2>
<p>Man was created by God in three parts (Gen. 1:26; 1 Thes. 5:23). Man&rsquo;s body made of dust is his outward shell, his framework (Gen. 2:7a). Medical doctors tell us that the study of the human body is endless.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Spirit Produced of the Breath of the Life<br />
of God Breathed into the Nostrils of Man</h2>
<p>Second, man was created with a spirit, not made but produced of the breath of the life of God breathed into the nostrils of man (Gen. 2:7b; Prov. 20:27). This is not the life of God but only the breath of the life of God. This is proven by Proverbs 20:27, which says, &ldquo;The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah&rdquo; (lit.). The word <em>spirit</em> here is the same Hebrew word for <em>breath</em> in Genesis 2:7. Thus, the breath of life breathed into man in Genesis 2:7 became man&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. A Soul, the Issue of the Combination<br />
of the Breath of God with the Body of Dust</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s body was formed of the dust of the ground; then God breathed into man&rsquo;s nostrils the breath of life. Outwardly, man has a body of dust, and inwardly, his spirit was produced of the breath of God. When these two were put together, the soul was produced. The soul was the issue of the combination of the breath of God with the body of dust (Gen. 2:7c). The soul is neither dusty nor spiritual. The Greek word for <em>soul</em> is <em>psuche,</em> from which comes the word <em>psychology.</em> Our soul is the psychological part of our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE THREE PARTS OF MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Spirit of Man Being the Innermost Part<br />
of Man as the Reality of Man</h2>
<p>The spirit of man is the innermost part of man as the reality of man, highly ranked with the heavens and the earth in God&rsquo;s creation (Zech. 12:1). If you do not live by the spirit, but live by the soul or by the body, you are not a real man. Man&rsquo;s reality is his spirit.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s spirit is the inner organ of man for him to contact God, to receive God, and to contain God for God&rsquo;s expression in man (John 4:24). To do anything, we need the proper organ. To see, we need eyes. To smell, we need a nose. We also have a particular organ to contact God. That organ is our human spirit. If we deny our mind and turn to our inner being, we can sense God. But if we remain in our mind and try to figure out where God is, we will not be able to sense Him. There is God, but we must use the proper organ to sense Him. The spirit of man is not only for contacting and receiving God but also for containing God that God may be expressed through man.</p>
<p>The spirit of man is the lamp of God to contact, receive, and contain God as the light for God to shine through man (Prov. 20:27). A lamp needs oil. Then it gives light. The lamp itself has no light. The light comes from the oil burning in the lamp. The oil is God the Spirit, and our spirit is a lamp. God the Spirit is the oil that burns into light to shine within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Soul of Man Being the Inner Part of Man<br />
as the Person of Man</h2>
<p>The soul of man is the inner part of man as the person of man in between man&rsquo;s spirit and man&rsquo;s body. The soul was meant to be under man&rsquo;s spirit as its subordinate to carry out the desires and purposes of the spirit of man. Furthermore, the soul was meant to be above man&rsquo;s body as its master to direct the move and activity of the body of man. Thus, according to the order of God&rsquo;s creation, the spirit is the &ldquo;boss,&rdquo; whereas the soul is the body&rsquo;s direct &ldquo;boss.&rdquo; The body should be the servant. The soul as a person has two organs. The inner organ is the spirit; the outer organ is the body. Yet the spirit is the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; of the soul.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE SPIRIT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS<br />
IN RELATION TO THEIR EXPERIENCE OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Elihu</h2>
<p>Elihu realized that there is a spirit in man which is the reality of man before God (Job 32:8, 18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. David</h2>
<p>David asked God for a willing spirit in the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation (Psa. 51:12). In the Old Testament, David realized that in order to enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation, we need a willing spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Mary</h2>
<p>Mary was in the New Testament, but she was an Old Testament saint. The spirit of Mary had exulted in God her Savior, so that her soul magnified the Lord (Luke 1:46-47).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS IN<br />
RELATION TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. In Their Experience of Christ as Life<br />
in the Dynamic Salvation of God</h2>
<p>For us to experience Christ as life in the dynamic salvation of God, we must know our spirit. Our first experience of Christ as life is our regeneration by the Spirit in our spirit (John 3:3, 6). Then our spirit witnesses with the Spirit that we are the children of God (Rom. 8:16; cf. 9:1). Now that we are saved, something within always helps us to realize that we are the children of God. That is our human spirit.</p>
<p>We have the spirit of the sonship of God in which we cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo; (Rom. 8:15). After we were regenerated, it became sweet to cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father,&rdquo; because our spirit has become a spirit of sonship. We have the Lord within us in our spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; The dwelling place of God is in our spirit (Eph. 2:22).</p>
<p>God is Spirit and we need to exercise our spirit to worship Him (John 4:24). Only spirit can worship Spirit. Furthermore, we must serve God in the newness of our spirit (Rom. 7:6b). In the church, if you serve God by your body or by your soul, you are old. People can sense this oldness. The newness in God&rsquo;s service is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:17 shows that we receive wisdom and revelation with our spirit. Paul prayed that God would give us a &ldquo;spirit of wisdom and revelation.&rdquo; In 3:5 he said that the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church was revealed to the apostles and prophets in their spirit. He also prayed in 3:16 that we would be strengthened into our spirit, our inner man. Then he said in 4:23 that we are to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. The mind needs to be filled with our spirit. Also, 5:18 indicates that we need to be filled with God in our spirit. Paul said that the believers should not be drunk with wine but should be filled in their spirit with God. To be drunk is to fill up our body with wine, but to be filled in our spirit is to be filled with God.</p>
<p>We need to set our mind on our spirit so that we may enjoy the indwelling Christ, the pneumatic Christ, as the indwelling Spirit to be our life and peace (Rom. 8:6b, 9-11). We have the Spirit of God as the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, but not in our mind, so we must set our mind on the spirit. Then the Spirit of God within our spirit will come to fill up our mind, and we will enjoy the indwelling Christ as our life and our peace.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:18 says that we need to pray at every time in our spirit. Ephesians has six chapters. Every chapter has a verse concerning our human spirit:</p>
<p class="indent1">1:17&mdash;a spirit of wisdom and revelation<br />
2:22&mdash;God dwells in our spirit<br />
3:5&mdash;revelation in our spirit<br />
3:16&mdash;strengthened into our spirit<br />
4:23&mdash;renewed in the spirit of our mind<br />
5:18&mdash;being filled in our spirit with God<br />
6:18&mdash;praying always in our spirit</p>
<p>If you take these verses away from Ephesians, it becomes an empty book. This shows that we need to live and walk with God in and according to our spirit (Rom. 8:4b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In Our Work to Minister Christ<br />
for the Producing and Building Up of His Body<br />
to Carry Out God&rsquo;s Eternal Economy</h2>
<p>In our work to minister Christ for the producing and building up of His Body to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy, we need to be burning in our spirit (Rom. 12:11) by fanning into flame the gift of God in our spirit, which is of power, love, and sobermindedness (2 Tim. 1:6-7).</p>
<p>We can see this by the examples of the apostles. They worked by exercising their spirit. Paul served God in his spirit (Rom. 1:9). He was provoked in his spirit by the worship of idols in Athens (Acts 17:16). He also purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem (19:21). He made this decision not in his mind but in his spirit. He was going bound in his spirit to Jerusalem (20:22). Apollos was fervent in his spirit in speaking Christ (18:25). John was in his spirit to see the four great visions concerning the church (Rev. 1:10&mdash;3:22), the destiny of the world (4:2&mdash;16:21), Babylon the great (the Roman Catholic Church) and her termination by Christ&rsquo;s second coming to establish His kingdom of one thousand years (17:3&mdash;20:15), and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (21:1&mdash;22:5). This is the entire book of Revelation. Revelation covers these four big visions. We too need to be in our spirit to see the visions in this book. It is a matter not merely of mental understanding in our mind but of spiritual realization in our spirit.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

		<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy the believers should live, walk, and have their being according to their spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:4b, 2) and only use their soul as their inner organ for them to live as a human being, as they use their body as their outer organ for them to do things outwardly, but they should deny and reject their soul as their person (Matt. 16:24-25; Luke 9:23-24).</li>

	<li>The believers needing to discern their spirit from their soul by the living, operative, and sharp word of God&mdash;Heb. 4:12:

		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The concluding word&mdash;the book of Romans, as a book on the organic and dynamic salvation of God in Christ, not only presents us a full and detailed definition of God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation but also gives us the way God takes to execute His dynamic salvation and apply it to the fallen sinners and the way the sinners should take for them to receive, experience, and enjoy God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation. These two ways are the divine Spirit of life and the human spirit of the believers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine Spirit of life is the Spirit of God processed and consummated to be the life-giving, compounded, and indwelling Spirit, who indwells the believers as the reality of the pneumatic, pneumatized Christ, as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, and as the reality of the divine resurrection. It is through such a Spirit of life that the eternal, only wise God, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden through the ages (Rom. 16:25), dispenses Himself in His processed and consummated Trinity into the believers to be their dynamic salvation as their life and everything.</li>
	<li>The human spirit of the believers is the believers&rsquo; spirit regenerated and indwelt by the divine Spirit of life and mingled with the divine Spirit of life as one spirit. It is through such a human spirit that the people chosen by God participate in the dynamic salvation of God as their living in this age and their destiny in eternity. Hence, &ldquo;the Spirit...with our spirit&rdquo; in verse 16 of Romans 8 (the key chapter of the book of Romans concerning the Spirit of life and the spirit of the believers) is the most crucial secret in the whole book of Romans for God to execute His dynamic salvation and for the believers to participate in it. We all have to know these two spirits in the divine enlightenment that we may enter, by the Spirit of life in our regenerated spirit which is mingled with the Spirit of life, into the intrinsic essence of the dynamic salvation of God in Christ, which is the Triune God processed and consummated to be our eternal inheritance for our enjoyment.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>In this message we want to continue our fellowship on the human spirit of the believers.</p>
<p>The New Testament unveils to us only three great, excellent persons. The first person is the all-inclusive, mysterious Christ. The first four books of the New Testament, the four Gospels, are on Christ the all-inclusive One, who was God becoming a man, the God-man. God is a mystery, and man is also a mystery. Christ is the One who combines these two together as one. Christ is neither merely God nor merely man. He is the God-man. Second, there is the mysterious, organic church, which was formed in the book of Acts. Following the all-inclusive Christ, the church came to be the second great person in the universe. The church begins in Acts and then occupies twenty-one books of the New Testament, twenty-one Epistles, from Romans to Jude. Third, the last great person in the New Testament is the New Jerusalem, which is seen in the last book of the Bible, Revelation.</p>
<p>These three great persons all need man to be in one part of his being, his human spirit. In the first four books, the human spirit is not mentioned often. Then in Acts, for the church, the human spirit, the spirit of the believers, is very crucial. The church is constituted with Christ and the believers. Christ is divine becoming human, possessing a human nature with a human spirit, and the church is the aggregate of all the believers as the Body of Christ. The church needs to be altogether in the human spirit. In the book of Acts and in the Epistles, the human spirit is unveiled again and again. Eventually, the New Jerusalem as the consummation is brought in.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE SPIRIT OF JOHN THE APOSTLE IN SEEING<br />
THE FOUR GREAT VISIONS, AS THE CONTENTS<br />
OF THE LAST BOOK OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>In Revelation, John saw four great visions. The first one is concerning the church (Rev. 1:10&mdash;3:22). The second one is concerning the world situation (4:2&mdash;16:21). The third one is concerning Babylon the great and her termination by Christ&rsquo;s coming back to set up His kingdom for one thousand years and to destroy Antichrist and Satan (17:3&mdash;20:15). The fourth vision is of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (21:1&mdash;22:5). In order to see these four great visions, the human spirit is needed. Every time John saw one of these visions he told us he was in spirit. The four verses in Revelation that show that John was in spirit to see these visions are 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; and 21:10.</p>
<p>We all have to realize that to be a genuine believer as a God-man, to live a life for the church as the Body of Christ so that Christ can come back to consummate the New Jerusalem, our human spirit is needed. Most Christians speak only of the Holy Spirit, but nearly no one talks about the human spirit. The story of God becoming a man that man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead to produce a Body which consummates in the New Jerusalem is altogether a story of two spirits. First, there is the divine Spirit as the Spirit of God, and then as the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, and the consummated Spirit. Then the divine Spirit needs the human spirit to match Him, to be His counterpart, that they could be mingled together as one entity (1 Cor. 6:17). In the whole universe, that mingling is consummated in the New Jerusalem. Today if we do not see our human spirit, we have no way to be a believer up to the standard of God&rsquo;s calling. The spirit of John the apostle in seeing the four great visions, as the contents of the last book of the Bible, concludes the holy Scripture in the consummation of the New Jerusalem for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. This shows that in order for us to be a God-chosen believer, a God-man, for the producing of the church, we need to be absolutely in the spirit, our human regenerated spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE DISCERNMENT OF THE SPIRIT FROM THE SOUL</h2>
<p>There is the need of the discernment of the human spirit from the human soul. God created man with a body and with a spirit to produce a soul (Gen. 2:7). But this man fell, and his spirit became deadened. So the fallen man pays attention mainly to his soul plus his body to take care of his physical and psychological needs. Nearly no one would pay attention to his spirit; even nearly no one knows that he has a spirit. The people in the world know only that they are a psychological person with a physical part as their body. They do not know the spirit.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened because of the fall. But the believers have been resurrected from that deadened situation to become regenerated persons. Regeneration transpires mainly in the believer&rsquo;s spirit (John 3:6). Today we have to discern our spirit from our soul. Regretfully, very few Christians know that they have a spirit, so for them there is no need to have any discernment. But for those of us who have been enlightened, we realize that in order to be a God-man, we must know our spirit. If we do not know our spirit, there is no way to be a Christian up to the standard of God&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Spirit and the Soul of Man<br />
Not Being Synonyms of the Same One Thing</h2>
<p>The spirit and the soul of man are not synonyms of the same one thing; they are two distinct parts of man&rsquo;s composition and can be distinctly divided from each other. First Thessalonians 5:23 confirms this fact, and Luke 1:46-47 strengthens such a teaching. In Luke 1:46-47 Mary said that her spirit had exulted in God her Savior and her soul magnified the Lord. Her word shows clearly that her two parts, the spirit and the soul, performed two different actions, her exulting in God and her magnifying the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament Believers Needing<br />
to Discern Their Spirit from Their Soul<br />
for Experiencing Christ</h2>
<p>For the New Testament believers to experience Christ for the producing and building up of His organic Body in the consummation of the New Jerusalem for the accomplishment of the eternal economy of God, they need to discern their spirit from their soul (Heb. 4:12).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s old creation, the spirit of man was the reality of man, and the soul of man was the person of man. In God&rsquo;s new creation, the spirit of the believers becomes their person, and their soul becomes their inner organ, as their body is their outer organ; they are a spiritual man according to their regenerated spirit with their soul as their inner organ, which is considered as the psychological part of man, and with their body as their outer organ, which is considered as the physical part of man. This is a believer in God&rsquo;s new creation. Our person today is the spirit, and this person has two organs, the soul as the inward organ and the body as the outward organ.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the believers should live, walk, and have their being according to their spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:4b, 2) and only use their soul as their inner organ for them to live as a human being, as they use their body as their outer organ for them to do things outwardly, but they should deny and reject their soul as their person (Matt. 16:24-25; Luke 9:23-24). Today all the fallen people still consider their soul as their person. Even many Christians do not know this point. Our soul is no longer our person. Our regenerated spirit has become our person. The soul should remain only as an organ.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Believers Needing to Discern<br />
Their Spirit from Their Soul by the Living,<br />
Operative, and Sharp Word of God</h2>
<p>The believers need to discern their spirit from their soul by the living, operative, and sharp word of God (Heb. 4:12). God&rsquo;s word always puts down our soul and uplifts our spirit. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ.&rdquo; This is to put down &ldquo;I,&rdquo; to put down the soul, the natural man. Galatians 2:20 goes on to say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; This is to uplift our spirit. The &ldquo;I&rdquo; is of the old creation. The &ldquo;me&rdquo; in whom Christ lives is a new creation. &ldquo;I&rdquo; was the soul, &ldquo;me&rdquo; is the spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 16:24-25, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.&rdquo; In Luke 9:24-25 <em>soul-life</em> is replaced with <em>himself,</em> indicating that our soul-life is our self. The Lord tells us to put down the soul and follow Him. The One we follow is the divine Spirit indwelling our human regenerated spirit. This shows that the words of the Bible always uplift the spirit and put down the soul.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s living word pierces to the dividing of the believers&rsquo; soul and spirit, as their joints and marrow are divided. God&rsquo;s operative and sharp word is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of their heart. They should pray-read the Word of God until it pierces into their spirit that they may be able to discern their spirit from their soul.</p>
<p>Let us apply this truth to our daily life. When we go shopping, do we buy things which the soul wants or which the spirit wants? We may wonder how we can discern the difference between what our soul wants and what our spirit wants. This is why we need to prayerfully read the Bible, the living Word. Day by day, the more we read the Bible, the more discerning ability we have. The people in the world may decide to buy something according to whether or not they need it. But this should not be the case with us. We have to say, &ldquo;What I should buy should be okayed by my spirit.&rdquo; Within us there is an ability to discern that our spirit is not for certain things. If our spirit does not give us the okay to buy something, we should not buy it. Such a teaching is very practical and very deep.</p>
<p>The way that we cut and style our hair must be okayed by our spirit, not by our soul. We must check ourselves by this principle. We may wonder how we can know the difference between the spirit&rsquo;s &ldquo;okay&rdquo; and the soul&rsquo;s &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; We should never forget that the spirit of our being is the deepest part of our being. Our soul is always on the surface. What comes from the surface must be something of the soul. What comes from &ldquo;underneath&rdquo; must be something from our spirit.</p>
<p>When we go shopping, we may see many things that we would like to buy, but we do not buy them, because we do not have the money. If we had the money, however, we would buy them. This is not to be checked by our spirit but to be checked by our checkbook. Many of us are not checked by our spirit according to the Word but by our checkbook.</p>
<p>In order to discern our spirit from our soul, we need to pray-read the Bible until it pierces into our being. For example, 1 John 2:15 says, &ldquo;Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him.&rdquo; If we pray-read such a verse, we will see that there are many things of the world which we still have. We may have some neckties which we did not buy according to the spirit. If so, those neckties are worldly. We must do everything according to our spirit. If a young brother is choosing a university to go to for his further education, he should choose it by exercising his spirit. We must live, walk, and have our being absolutely according to our spirit.</p>
<p>In the old creation, your spirit was only the reality, but your soul was the person. Since the day you were transferred from the old creation to the new creation through regeneration, your spirit became your person. Now you must be a person in the spirit, not a person in the soul. The soul is now the organ. The Bible tells us that we need to deny our soul. To deny the self is to deny the soul.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;How can we live if we deny our soul? If the soul is denied, how can we think?&rdquo; We must remember that the soul as the person, not as the organ, should be denied. We deny the person, not the organ. A spiritual person must be very strong in the mind, that is, in knowing and discerning things. But in God&rsquo;s new creation, the spirit of the believers becomes their person because the spirit becomes the inner man (Eph. 3:17), and their soul becomes only an organ. You would not ask your finger whether or not it agreed with you if you wanted to buy something. In the same way, you should not consult your soul, because your soul is an inner organ. Do not regard your soul as your person. The person is your spirit. What you do is not up to your soul&rsquo;s &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; If the spirit does not give you the okay, you should not do it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>The book of Romans, as a book on the organic and dynamic salvation of God in Christ, not only presents us a full and detailed definition of God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation but also gives us the way God takes to execute His dynamic salvation and apply it to the fallen sinners and the way the sinners should take for them to receive, experience, and enjoy God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation. These two ways are the divine Spirit of life and the human spirit of the believers.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the way God takes to execute His dynamic salvation and apply this salvation to fallen sinners. At one time the Spirit was not yet (John 7:39), but today the Spirit as the Spirit of life is here. Thus, the Spirit of life is God&rsquo;s way to execute His salvation and apply His salvation to us, and our human spirit is the way to receive, experience, and enjoy God&rsquo;s dynamic salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Divine Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>The divine Spirit of life is the Spirit of God processed and consummated to be the life-giving, compounded, and indwelling Spirit, who indwells the believers as the reality of the pneumatic, pneumatized Christ, as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, and as the reality of the divine resurrection. It is through such a Spirit of life that the eternal, only wise God, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden through the ages (Rom. 16:25), dispenses Himself in His processed and consummated Trinity into the believers to be their dynamic salvation as their life and everything.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Human Spirit of the Believers</h2>
<p>The human spirit of the believers is the believers&rsquo; spirit regenerated and indwelt by the divine Spirit of life and mingled with the divine Spirit of life as one spirit. It is through such a human spirit that the people chosen by God participate in the dynamic salvation of God as their living in this age and their destiny in eternity. Hence, &ldquo;the Spirit...with our spirit&rdquo; in verse 16 of Romans 8 (the key chapter of the book of Romans concerning the Spirit of life and the spirit of the believers) is the most crucial secret in the whole book of Romans for God to execute His dynamic salvation and for the believers to participate in it. We all have to know these two spirits in the divine enlightenment that we may enter, by the Spirit of life in our regenerated spirit which is mingled with the Spirit of life, into the intrinsic essence of the dynamic salvation of God in Christ, which is the Triune God processed and consummated to be our eternal inheritance for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>What the Lord has burdened me to release here is an up-to-date vision. These intrinsic things are in the New Testament, but they are not seen by many. So to release such a word, there is the need of a struggling, a battle, a spiritual fighting.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

</ol>
<p>I am looking to the Lord that this outline with this short fellowship can be a controlling vision to us for our direction and goal until He comes back. We want to see the most marvelous, excellent, mysterious, and all-inclusive transformations of the eternal and Triune God in His becoming a man. God is complete, perfect, and unchanging, but He has had many transformations. In my youth I was taught that the Lord Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Heb. 13:8). But after I got into the intrinsic depths of the Scriptures, I found out that merely to say this is not adequate in the interpretation of the deep mysteries concerning Christ, because the Bible shows us that God has been transformed. God became a man. Is this not a transformation? All of His transformations are marvelous, excellent, mysterious, and all-inclusive.</p><h2 class="head1">I. IN HIS BECOMING THE FLESH</h2>
<p>The Triune God became a God-man, bringing divinity into humanity and mingling divinity with humanity as a prototype for the mass reproduction of many God-men. He became the embodiment of the Triune God (John 1:14), bringing God to man and making God contactable, touchable, receivable, experienceable, enterable, and enjoyable. The very God who was in eternity became, through transformation, the very embodiment of the Triune God which is typified by the tabernacle, a solid entity for people to contact, to touch, to receive, to experience, to enter into, and to enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. IN HIS HUMAN LIVING</h2>
<p>He could not have lived a human life unless He had been transformed into a man. He lived a human life, yet He lived not by His human life but by His divine life to express the divine attributes in His human virtues. Such a living is the model of the human living of His mass reproduction of the many God-men (1 Pet. 2:21). He was not only the prototype for the mass reproduction of Himself; He was also a model, an example, for His mass reproduction of the many God-men to repeat His living, to be &ldquo;Xerox copies&rdquo; of His human living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. IN HIS ALL-PROBLEMS-SOLVING DEATH</h2>
<p>His death was not merely the all-inclusive death. It is more definite to say that His death was the all-problems-solving death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Becoming the Flesh of Sin<br />
(Only in Its Likeness)</h2>
<p>To accomplish such a death, He became the flesh of sin (but only in its likeness&mdash;Rom. 8:3). He had the likeness of the flesh of sin, but within Him there is no sin (1 John 3:5). It was by this that He was made sin (2 Cor. 5:21) and condemned sin in the flesh (Rom. 8:3). The flesh, with sin in it, was condemned, judged, by God. He was the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world (John 1:29). We need to pay our full attention to this. He was God. First, He became a man. Second, He became the embodiment of God, which was the real tabernacle. Then He became the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Becoming a Serpent<br />
(Only in Its Likeness as the Bronze Serpent)</h2>
<p>In His becoming a man, He also became a serpent (only in its likeness as the bronze serpent&mdash;Num. 21:4-9; John 3:14). It is difficult to imagine that one day God in His incarnation became a serpent, as typified by the bronze serpent. By becoming a serpent, He destroyed the devil, the ancient serpent (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14), and He judged the world, which is the system (invented by the satanic systematization), the cosmos, of the devil, its ruler (John 12:31).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Becoming the End of the Old Man</h2>
<p>He also became the end of the old man. As the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45b), He ended the old man. As the end of the old man, He crucified the old man (Rom. 6:6) and terminated the old creation. The old man is the representative, the center, of the old creation, so by destroying the old man He terminated the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Becoming the Peacemaker</h2>
<p>In His all-problems-solving death, He also became the Peacemaker (Eph. 2:14-16). It is not accurate to say that God has never changed. In eternity past He was only God; He was not the Peacemaker. He became the Peacemaker on the cross. He made peace by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances which separate men from one another. Ordinances separate the Jews from the Gentiles. These separating ordinances include the customs and the ways of man&rsquo;s living and worshipping. All the different tribes, races, and peoples have their different customs and ways of living and worshipping God. The entire world is divided, separated, by these different ways of living and worship. The Chinese have their way of eating with chopsticks, and the Indonesians have their way of eating with their fingers. These different ways are dividers, separators. But on the cross Christ abolished all the ordinances, the different ways of living and worship, that men may have peace with one another, and He reconciled man to God, thus making peace. As a result, we are here as the one new man. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there are people from every inhabited continent. Christ as the Peacemaker accomplished this through His all-problems-solving death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Becoming the Grain of Wheat</h2>
<p>He also became a grain of wheat (John 12:24). He fell into the earth and died to break the shell of His humanity and to release His divine life for the producing of many grains to constitute His organic Body. Christ as the one grain became the many grains, and the many grains are the many sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. IN HIS ALL-CONQUERING RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>In His all-conquering resurrection, He accomplished three main things. First, He uplifted His humanity for Him to be begotten of God as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29). Second, He became, by God the Father&rsquo;s regeneration, the many sons of God as His many brothers (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:29). He was born to be the firstborn Son, and He became the many sons of God. The many sons of God are the many brothers of Christ, and the many brothers are the members of Christ. Colossians 3 reveals that every member of the new man is Christ (vv. 10b-11). In the new man, Christ is all the members and in all the members. We became Christ in His resurrection. Thus, we can declare that we are Christ. Third, Christ, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, the all-inclusive compounded Spirit, as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God (1 Cor. 15:45b; Exo. 30:23-25). These are His transformations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. IN HIS ALL-TRANSCENDING ASCENSION</h2>
<p>In His all-transcending ascension, He became the Head of all things to be the Head of the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23; Col. 1:18). He was made the Head of all things that He might be the Head of the Body. He also became the Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), the Leader (of all the kings) and Savior (5:31), our High Priest in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (Heb. 4:14; 7:26; 9:11), the Mediator of the new covenant (9:15), the surety of the better covenant (7:22), the Paraclete (Advocate, Comforter) of the New Testament believers (1 John 2:1; John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7), the New Testament believers&rsquo; Intercessor at the right hand of God and within them as well (Rom. 8:34, 26), and the heavenly Minister (Heb. 8:2). In eternity past He was not all of these items. He became all of these items in His all-transcending ascension.</p>
<p>The transformations of the eternal and Triune God in His becoming a man are for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. Such a vision should control, direct, and be our goal for our whole life until we see Him. When Brother Watchman Nee and I were young people, we were caught by the Lord. We decided to spend our whole life to study the Bible, to find out what is in this book. What we have seen in the Bible is absolutely different from deformed Christianity. This short message with the accompanying outline is the crystallization of my lifelong study of the Bible. Every point is documented by the Bible.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol><h2 class="head2">Romans 1:4, note 4 (revised)</h2>
<p>The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast to the flesh in v. 3. As the flesh in v. 3 refers to the human nature of Christ in the flesh, so the Spirit in this verse does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God but to the divine essence of Christ. This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself (John 4:24), the divinity of Christ, is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1 Peter 3:18, note 3 (revised)</h2>
<p>Not the Holy Spirit but the Spirit as Christ&rsquo;s divine essence (Rom. 1:4; cf. John 4:24a). The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh&mdash;which He received through His incarnation (John 1:14)&mdash;not in His Spirit as His divinity. His Spirit as His divinity did not die at the cross when His flesh died; rather, His Spirit as His divinity was made alive, enlivened, with new power of life, so that in this empowered Spirit as His divinity He made a proclamation to the fallen angels after His death in the flesh and before His resurrection.</p>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You as the Son of God. Especially we worship You as the God-man. You are the real God and the perfect man. Lord, You are even the consummated God and the uplifted man. We are looking unto You. Lord, You are everything, and we are nothing. You are the center of God&rsquo;s economy and also the goal of our pursuit. Lord, we want to know You, to comprehend You, and to gain You. You are the reality of all the revelations. We do not just want the vain revelations without the reality. Lord, in these days while we are seeking You, grant us to experience You every day as the reality of all the revelations You have shown us. Lord, cover us. We surely need Your covering. You know how the enemy is struggling to fight against the release of Your word in a deeper way. Lord, show us how You became man in Your divinity to bring Your divinity into man and how You became the life-giving Spirit and the firstborn Son of God bringing humanity into divinity. We worship You as such a One. Amen.</p>
<p>In this message we want to see the designation of Christ&rsquo;s humanity. Christ is the very God, the triune, eternal, self-existing, and ever-existing God. According to His heart&rsquo;s desire, one day He became a man. By becoming a man, He brought divinity into humanity. Then He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. He lived a human life but by the divine life. Then He went to the cross, was crucified there, and entered into resurrection.</p>
<p>The first marvelous and excellent thing which transpired in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was the designation of His humanity. <em>Designated</em> means &ldquo;resurrected.&rdquo; <em>Designated</em> in Romans 1:4 refers to His resurrection. In resurrection Christ&rsquo;s humanity was uplifted into His divinity. In His incarnation He brought divinity into humanity, and in His resurrection He brought His humanity into divinity. This divine traffic mingles God and man as one. Thus, He became the God-man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. CHRIST&rsquo;S TWO NATURES, DIVINE AND HUMAN</h2>
<p>In order to help us get into such a deep word, I want to present the designation of Christ&rsquo;s humanity in the following way. First, we have to see Christ&rsquo;s two natures&mdash;divine and human. The Bible is a divine revelation. Quite often, some revelations in the Bible are too deep, far beyond our human understanding. Apparently, all the Christians who read the Bible have come to know that Christ has two natures. Because He is both God and man, He possesses the divine nature and the human nature. In order to enter into the depths of the divine revelation concerning the designation of Christ&rsquo;s humanity, we need to see the two natures of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ&rsquo;s Human Nature&mdash;His Humanity</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. According to the Flesh, Christ<br />
Being out of the Seed of David<br />
to Be the Son of Man</h2>
<p>According to the flesh, Christ was a human being that came out of the seed of David (Rom. 1:3). The seed of David is a descendant of David. Christ, according to the flesh as a human being, was one of the descendants of David. He was out of the seed of David, not to be the Son of God, because David was not God. David was a man. Therefore, Christ, according to His flesh, came out of the seed of David to be the Son of Man (John 3:14). In the four Gospels, the Lord referred to Himself as the Son of Man seventy-eight times.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Typified by the Bronze Serpent</h2>
<p>This was typified by the bronze serpent spoken of in Numbers 21:4-9. In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus Himself said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; The Lord as the Son of Man was a serpent, but only a serpent in form, in likeness, not a serpent in poison.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Bearing the Likeness of the Serpent<br />
(the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin),<br />
without the Poison of the Serpent</h2>
<p>Romans 8:3 says that Christ bore the likeness of the flesh of sin. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; Because <em>flesh</em> is a negative term, the Chinese translators dared not translate this literally. Their translation of the word <em>flesh</em> in this verse is the word for <em>body</em>. But the Bible tells us definitely that Christ as the Word of God became flesh. Then Paul in Romans 8:3 gave us a definition of what this means. Christ as the Word of God became flesh in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Related to Sin, Satan, and the World</h2>
<p>By reading the Bible carefully, we can see that there are three big, ugly things involved with the flesh. These three things are sin, Satan, and the world, the cosmos, the satanic system. The flesh, sin, Satan, and the world are four-in-one. God is triune, three-in-one. Now Satan has become four-in-one. Sin and the world came from Satan, and Satan today is in our flesh. We have pointed out that Christ became a man in the likeness of the flesh of sin. This fact indicates that He was indirectly involved with sin, Satan, and the world, yet not in reality, just in the likeness.</p>
<p>Paul, who was very strong in the deeper truths, said in 2 Corinthians 5:21, &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&rdquo; John said that Christ as God became flesh, and Paul had the boldness to say that God made Christ sin. Christ is the One who knows no sin. He had nothing to do with sin, but God made this One, who had nothing to do with sin, sin.</p>
<p>We can see a picture of this in Numbers 21:4-9 with the children of Israel in the wilderness. They offended God and He sent serpents among them to bite them. When they cried out to God, He told Moses to make a bronze serpent and lift it up on a pole. Everyone who looked upon this bronze serpent would live. This bronze serpent was in the form of the biting serpent but without the poison. Such a serpent in the form of a serpent but without the poison became their savior, their deliverer. This bronze serpent delivered them from the poison by imparting life to them.</p>
<p>In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus revealed that He was the reality of that bronze serpent in the wilderness, indicating that when He was in the flesh, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, which likeness is equal to the form of the bronze serpent, which did not have the poison of the serpent. Verse 15 goes on to say that whoever believes into Him will receive eternal life.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s making Christ sin is a very deep and bothering point in the entire Bible. His being made sin includes all sins. During the last three hours of His death on the cross, in the eyes of God Christ was made sin, so He was judged by God and even forsaken by God (Matt. 27:45-46 and note 45<sup>1</sup>). God made Him sin to die for us sinners in the form, the likeness, of the serpent, without the poison of the serpent. If He had had the poison, He could not have been our Redeemer. Also, if He had not been in the likeness of the serpent, He could not have been our Redeemer. He had to be a serpent in the likeness of a serpent but without the poison; then He could be our Redeemer.</p>
<p>I hope that by this simple explanation we can realize that Christ became flesh to be indirectly involved with sin only in the likeness of the flesh of sin but not in the reality. He bore the likeness of the serpent (the likeness of the flesh of sin), without the poison of the serpent (Rom. 8:3b). In this sense, His becoming flesh caused Him to be indirectly related to sin, Satan, and the world. His becoming related to sin is seen in 2 Corinthians 5:21. His being related to Satan is seen in Hebrews 2:14. This verse shows that Christ destroyed Satan by partaking of blood and flesh. By becoming the flesh, Christ crucified, destroyed, Satan on the cross. When God judged Christ on the cross, Satan was destroyed in the flesh. Then John 12:31 tells us that when Christ was judged by God on the cross, the world was also judged. By that one death, that one crucifixion on the cross, four things were cleared up: the flesh (the fallen man), sin, Satan, and the world. When we speak of Christ&rsquo;s human nature, we have to understand all of these points.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Christ&rsquo;s Divine Nature&mdash;His Divinity</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. According to the Spirit of Holiness,<br />
Christ Being Designated the Son of God</h2>
<p>Romans 1:4 says that Christ&rsquo;s humanity &ldquo;was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.&rdquo; Here the Spirit of holiness is different from the Holy Spirit. In the Divine Trinity there are three Persons, and the third One is the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit in Romans 1:4 is the same as that mentioned in John 4:24, where the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; This does not mean that God is the Holy Spirit. To say that God is the Holy Spirit is right, but John 4:24 does not refer to the Holy Spirit of the Divine Trinity. It refers to the Spirit as God&rsquo;s essence, God&rsquo;s nature. To say that God is Spirit is like saying that a stand made of steel is steel. Steel is the very essence of the stand. In the same way, Spirit is the essence of God. When Christ became a man, picking up humanity, He did not give up His divinity. He came to be a man in His divinity, and that divinity is the Spirit, as mentioned in Romans 1:4 and John 4:24.</p>
<p>Christ, while He was on the earth, was both God and man. According to His being a man, He was the flesh. According to His being God, He was the Spirit. Christ is one person of two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. The human nature is the flesh, and the divine nature is the Spirit.</p>
<p>First Peter 3:18 says that when Christ was being put to death on the cross, His flesh was being put to death, not His Spirit. His Spirit, at the same time, was very active, was made alive. One person was crucified on the cross. According to His flesh, He was crucified, but according to His Spirit, He was very active, made strong.</p>
<p>According to the Spirit of holiness, Christ was designated the Son of God. According to the flesh, He was the Son of David. But according to the Spirit, He was the Son of God. According to His humanity, He was the Son of Man, but how could His humanity become the Son of God? This is one of the hardest points in the Bible for us to understand.</p>
<p>We are human beings, so we are all sons of man. How can God make us His children? God does this by regeneration. Human beings are the sons of man. God&rsquo;s children are the children of God. We human beings have been made children of God by regeneration. Regeneration is God coming into us, into our spirit, to be an element added into our human spirit. In regeneration our human spirit was made divine. When we were regenerated by God, we were made divine.</p>
<p>In the same principle, while Christ was on this earth before His resurrection, a part of Him, His humanity, was not divine. That human part was the Son of Man, not the Son of God. In His death His human part was crucified. Then in His resurrection God the Spirit as Christ&rsquo;s divinity was made strong, very active, to put divinity into the humanity of Christ to make it divine. This is the same principle of our regeneration. Before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, Christ&rsquo;s humanity was just human. But in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, His divinity as the Spirit was made strong to impart Himself into His humanity to make it divine. Thus, Christ became the Son of God in His humanity.</p>
<p>The Son of God in resurrection is different from the only begotten Son of God. The only begotten Son of God was only divine, without humanity. But the Son of God in resurrection is both divine and human, so this Son of God is not the Only Begotten but the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). Thus, we may say that Christ in His humanity was the first one regenerated, so He became our firstborn Brother, and we became His many brothers. He and we all were regenerated in His resurrection.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2 reveals that in our spirit we were dead in offenses, but when Christ in His resurrection was made alive, we were made alive together with Him (v. 5). His humanity was crucified, but in resurrection His humanity was made alive by the Spirit. Ephesians 2 says we were made alive and resurrected with Christ (vv. 5-6). This confirms Romans 1. We were regenerated by being made alive with Christ, by being raised up with Christ. First Peter 1:3 tells us that in the resurrection of Christ, God has regenerated all the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. In Power</h2>
<p><em>Power</em> in Romans 1:4 is the power of life. The phrase <em>inpower</em> corresponds with 1 Peter 3:18, which says that Christ&rsquo;s flesh was put to death, but His Spirit was made alive. To be made alive means to be empowered.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Out of Resurrection</h2>
<p>Christ came to be a man. He came out of the seed of David, so the seed of David is the source of Christ&rsquo;s flesh. Then Christ&rsquo;s humanity through resurrection became the Son of God out of resurrection. As the Son of Man, He came out of the seed of David. As the Son of God, He came out of resurrection. The resurrection is the Triune God embodied in Christ. In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus, the embodiment of the Triune God, said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection.&rdquo; That means the Triune God is the resurrection. If there were no God, there would be no resurrection in this universe. Resurrection is God, and this is the source out of which the firstborn Son of God came into being.</p><h2 class="head1">II. CHRIST&rsquo;S DEATH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. For Sins, the Righteous<br />
on Behalf of the Unrighteous,<br />
That He Might Bring His Believers to God</h2>
<p>First Peter 3:18 says, &ldquo;For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit.&rdquo; It is true that Christ died on the cross for our sins that we might be forgiven and redeemed. But here Peter said that Christ died for the purpose of bringing His believers to God. He not only brought us to God but also into God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. On the One Hand, Crucified in the Flesh</h2>
<p>On the one hand, Christ was put to death in the flesh, so He was crucified on the cross in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. On the Other Hand, Made Alive in the Spirit</h2>
<p>On the other hand, Christ was made alive in the Spirit. Man put Him to death in the flesh, but God made Him alive in the Spirit. One death was going on, but two things were happening. This is what happens to a grain of wheat which has been sown into the earth. On the one hand, the grain dies, but there is another element in the grain, the life element. When the grain is dying, its life element grows.</p>
<p>John 12:24 says clearly that Christ was the grain of wheat. He was dying on the cross, on the one hand, in the flesh. On the other hand, He was growing in the Spirit. Verse 23 says that this was Christ&rsquo;s glorification. Christ gained the glorification through that kind of &ldquo;dying death&rdquo; and &ldquo;living death.&rdquo; On the one hand, He was dying a &ldquo;dying death.&rdquo; On the other hand, He was dying a &ldquo;living death.&rdquo; We need to see that while Christ was dying in the flesh on the cross, He was living.</p>
<p>Peter says that in this made-alive Spirit, Christ went and proclaimed to the fallen angels in prison probably the victory of God over Satan their leader through the incarnation of God in Christ and Christ&rsquo;s death in the flesh (1 Pet. 3:19). On the cross Christ was made alive by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose and even to proclaim God&rsquo;s victory over Satan.</p>
<p>First Peter 3:18 shows that in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, His divine part was made alive to impart divinity into His humanity, making His humanity divine. In this way God, in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, begot Christ. Acts 13:33 says that on the day of resurrection God said, &ldquo;Today I have begotten You.&rdquo; That begetting equals our regenerating. Christ was begotten and we were regenerated in the same resurrection, at the same time. This resurrection was a big birth, a big delivery. Among the human race, no one has ever had twelve children at once. But in the universe there was a divine birth, a divine delivery, in which millions of children were born together with Christ as their firstborn Brother.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE DESIGNATION OF CHRIST&rsquo;S HUMANITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ&rsquo;s Humanity&mdash;the Flesh&mdash;<br />
Being Not Divine but Human</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s humanity, the flesh, was not divine but human.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In His Resurrection,<br />
His Humanity Being Designated</h2>
<p>In His resurrection, His humanity was designated (resurrected, uplifted) into His divinity, that is, into His divine glory (John 12:23; Luke 24:25-26).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. By the Spirit of Holiness</h2>
<p>The Spirit of holiness is Christ&rsquo;s divine part, His divinity. By His divinity His humanity was made divine.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. In the Divine Power</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s humanity was designated in the divine power. The reality of the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Out of Resurrection</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s humanity was designated into His divinity out of resurrection, which is the Triune God embodied in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. To Be the Son of God</h2>
<p>By resurrection Christ was designated the Son of God with His humanity. He is the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Born of God in His Resurrection</h2>
<p>This means that He was born of God in His resurrection (Acts 13:33) to be the firstborn Son of God among His many brothers, the many sons of God (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. His Redeemed Believers Born (Regenerated)<br />
with Him in the Same Resurrection</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:3 and Ephesians 2:6 reveal that Christ&rsquo;s redeemed believers were regenerated with Him in the same resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE TWO STATUSES OF CHRIST&rsquo;S SONSHIP</h2>
<p>Christ as the Son of God has two statuses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Only Begotten Son of God</h2>
<p>Christ is the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18), possessing the divine nature, divinity, from eternity to eternity (Psa. 90:2; Rom. 9:5) as the Second in the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Firstborn Son of God</h2>
<p>Christ is also the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29), possessing both the divine nature and the human nature&mdash;divinity and humanity&mdash;from His resurrection through His ascension and His second coming to eternity. He is the firstborn Son of God beginning from and not earlier than His resurrection (Acts 13:33). The firstborn Son of God had not come into being before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>In Matthew 26:64 the high priest asked the Lord Jesus if He was the Son of God, but He answered with &ldquo;the Son of Man.&rdquo; He said that when He comes back, He will be the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven. From the time of His resurrection, all of Christ&rsquo;s activity is not as the only begotten Son of God, but as the firstborn Son of God in both His divinity and humanity. So in Christ&rsquo;s ascension He is still the Son of Man. Both Stephen and the apostle John saw this (Acts 7:55-56; Rev. 1:13). In His first coming He was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son. In His second coming He will be the Firstborn (Heb. 1:6). For eternity He will be the Son of Man (John 1:51 and note 3).</p>
<p>Many Christians do not realize this deeper truth. They would agree that Christ is both God and man, but they might feel that Christ was no longer a man after His resurrection and ascension. Unconsciously, they may think that Christ was a man only for the thirty-three and a half years from His incarnation to His resurrection.</p>
<p>Joseph from Arimathea took the body of Jesus and he and Nicodemus bound it in linen cloths and laid it in a new tomb (John 19:38-42). On the morning of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, Peter and John saw the linen cloths lying there in the tomb and the handkerchief which had been over His head folded up in one place apart (20:5-7). Christ&rsquo;s body was gone because His body had been resurrected by being transformed from His humanity into His divinity. If you say Christ was a man only for thirty-three and a half years, then I would ask, &ldquo;Where is His body today?&rdquo; The Bible tells us that when He resurrected, He left only the linen cloths and the handkerchief in the tomb. He did not leave His body there. His body was resurrected by being transformed from His humanity into His divinity, and that transformation was God&rsquo;s begetting. God begot Him in resurrection.</p>
<p>All these are the deep details in the Bible. After this fellowship, I hope that you will be made very clear. Christ&rsquo;s humanity was put on in His incarnation, but this humanity was transformed, begotten by God, from His humanity into His divinity in resurrection. So today He is still the Son of Man, not in the original human form, but in the transformed, divine form. In resurrection we were regenerated with Him, but we were not transformed with Him. When He comes, He will transform, or transfigure, our body into His glorious body. Christ is the firstborn Son of God among the many sons of God, His many brothers, who are God&rsquo;s many sons (Rom. 8:29, 19; Heb. 2:10-12).</p>
<p><em>Question: At what point did Christ&rsquo;s divinity become mingledwith His humanity? Was it in incarnation or resurrection?</em></p>
<p>Answer: From incarnation to resurrection Christ was God and man, and this man and God were one. But at that time the mingling had not been consummated. The mingling was consummated by resurrection. Before resurrection His humanity was not brought into His divinity. The mingling of God with man was completed by resurrection.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Among the eight writers who participated in the unveiling of the divine revelation in the New Testament concerning the grace of God, three are particular, that is, John, Paul, and Peter.</li>
<li>In John&rsquo;s writings:
	<ol class="decimal">
	<li>In the unveiling of God the Father being life in the Son as the Spirit to the believers, John begins his writings with the grace which came with Christ in His incarnation (John 1:14-17) and ends with the grace as the consummation not only of his writings but also of the entire Scriptures (Rev. 22:21).</li>
	<li>This indicates that in the accomplishment of His eternal economy, God commences it in His incarnation by coming to be a man as the grace to the believers. Hence, grace is the Triune God in His incarnation to be dispensed to the believers by the Father as the source, by the Son as the element, and by the Spirit as the application (2 Cor. 13:14). So, in this dispensing of God, the grace is called the grace of God (1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 1:12; 8:1; 9:14), the grace of Christ (2 Cor. 8:9; 12:9; 13:14), and the grace of which the Spirit is (Heb. 10:29).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Peter&rsquo;s writings, the grace of God is presented as:
	<ol class="decimal">
	<li>The grace that multiplies in the believers&rsquo; daily life in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus their Lord&mdash;1 Pet. 1:2; 2 Pet. 1:2.</li>
	<li>The grace of life that is the inheritance of all the believers, whether strong or weak&mdash;1 Pet. 3:7.</li>
	<li>The varied grace of God that indicates the riches of the grace of God in its varieties ministered by the saints one to another&mdash;4:10.</li>
	<li>The all grace by which God, who has called the believers into His eternal glory, perfects, establishes, strengthens, and grounds them through their sufferings&mdash;5:10.</li>
	<li>The true grace of God that is the all grace of God in verse 10, into which the believers should enter and in which they should stand&mdash;5:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In his writings, Paul unveils to us that the grace of God is:
	<ol class="decimal">
	<li>The grace for the enablement of the apostles&mdash; Rom. 1:5.</li>
	<li>The grace for the believers&rsquo; living&mdash;Rom. 1:7 and in the beginning of all his other Epistles except Hebrews.</li>
	<li>The grace by which we are justified freely through the redemption in Christ Jesus&mdash;3:24.</li>
	<li>The grace versus wages in God&rsquo;s accounting for His justification of the believers&mdash;4:4.</li>
	<li>The grace for the believers to inherit the promise of God, going along with faith&mdash;4:16.</li>
	<li>The grace into which the believers have entered and in which they stand&mdash;5:2.</li>
	<li>The abounding grace of God in which is the free gift of Christ&mdash;5:15, 20; 6:1.</li>
	<li>The grace that enables the believers to reign (as a king) in life&mdash;5:17.</li>
	<li>The grace that may reign through righteousness unto eternal life&mdash;5:21.</li>
	<li>The grace that constitutes the dispensation of the New Testament, which is separated from the dispensation of the law of the Old Testament, and under which the believers are to overcome sin&rsquo;s lording it over them&mdash;6:14-15.</li>
	<li>The grace by which God selected His people and which is versus works&mdash;11:5-6.</li>
	<li>The grace by which the apostles carried out their ministry&mdash;12:3; 15:15.</li>
	<li>The grace according to which the gifts are distributed to the believers; hence, grace is the basis of the gifts&mdash;12:6; cf. Eph. 4:7.</li>
	<li>The grace which is the enjoyment of God by the believers, under whose feet God will crush Satan&mdash; 16:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Before going over the outline of this message, I would like to speak an opening word to help us understand the intrinsic significance of the grace of God.</p>
<p>A number of Christians think that grace is God&rsquo;s blessing. When a grandfather considers his grandson, he may say, &ldquo;Oh, what a grace!&rdquo; Another person may say, &ldquo;Today in our business, we have become somewhat rich. Oh, what a grace!&rdquo; There is a hymn which says, &ldquo;Count your blessings, name them one by one; / Count your blessings, see what God hath done&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #707). Some Chinese translators of this hymn translated <em>blessing</em> into &ldquo;grace.&rdquo; This is a wrong translation. For years I tried to gain the proper understanding of the grace of God. One day the Lord showed me that grace is the processed and consummated Triune God Himself. Grace is God processed and consummated for us that we may enjoy Him. From the day that I saw this, the light and revelation concerning grace has been continually increasing.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, grace is the top revelation. John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, not full of blessing, but full of grace and reality. Verse 17 says that the law was given through Moses, but grace came. The word <em>came</em> indicates that grace is personified. Grace came through Jesus Christ. God&rsquo;s incarnation, which was the coming of grace, is the biggest revelation concerning God&rsquo;s economy. John 1 tells us that God&rsquo;s incarnation was His coming. Verse 14 says He was incarnated, becoming flesh. Then verse 17 says that grace came through Him. Grace is the processed and consummated Triune God.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament grace was spoken of quite a few times, but in the Old Testament sense, which was low in standard and could not be compared with the grace mentioned in the New Testament in the sense of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>In the sense of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, grace denotes the contents of the eternal economy of God for the producing of the Body of Christ which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Hence, grace presented to us in the New Testament is much, much higher in standard than that in the Old Testament. This grace in the New Testament sense begins with the incarnation of God for the accomplishment of His eternal economy. In John 1:14 and 17, this New Testament grace came at the incarnation of God. Before the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, in the Old Testament, God had never come into man to be man&rsquo;s life and nature, so in this sense there was not such a grace in the Old Testament time.</p>
<p>The New Testament unveils to us that grace is the Triune God coming into us as our life, as our everything, and as our enjoyment through His processes. After passing through the necessary processes, He was consummated.</p>
<p>When the Divine Trinity passed through the processes and was consummated, the Spirit was among the three. We should not think that it was only the Son of God who was incarnated. The complete God was incarnated. First Timothy 3:16 says that God was manifested in the flesh. God is the complete God, not just the Son, but the Son with the Father and the Spirit. According to our study of the Bible, the Spirit, through the necessary processes, was consummated as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) coming into His believers to be their life, nature, and everything. Thus, grace is the biggest truth, the biggest revelation, in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. It is as great as God&rsquo;s incarnation. When God was incarnated, He became grace to us. John 1:14 says that God was incarnated. Then verse 17 says that grace came through Him.</p>
<p>In order to enter into the intrinsic significance of grace, we need to see one point which is very crucial. According to the entire Bible, God does not want us to do anything for our salvation, to do something to please Him. Instead, God says that we must stop ourselves. The principle of the Sabbath is for us to stop ourselves, not do anything, and let God be everything to us and do everything for us. He is everything to us, does everything for us, and will do everything for us. God wants man to be saved, but man should not try to save himself. This is an offense and an insult to God. God would say, &ldquo;Man, do you think you can work out your salvation by yourself? Don&rsquo;t you know that in the whole universe only I, God, can work out a salvation? Not only so, I, God, can be your salvation. I don&rsquo;t want you to do something. I want you to rest and let Me do something for you.&rdquo; This is grace.</p>
<p>This understanding of grace corresponds with Hebrews 11:6, which says, &ldquo;He who comes forward to God must believe that He is.&rdquo; We have to believe that He is and we are not. He is the Savior; we are not. Christ, the embodiment of God, is our sanctification; we are not. This is why we must not touch the work of God&rsquo;s salvation. In God&rsquo;s salvation, we are not. We are nothing, but God is everything, and this everything is grace. God is everything to us, God does everything for us, and God will do everything for us for eternity. This is grace. Grace is God Himself as everything to us.</p>
<p>In these days we have seen the high peak of the divine revelation. This high peak is that God became a man that man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. How can we become God in life and in nature? We are like turtles and God is like an eagle. Can a turtle make himself an eagle? In His old creation, God created man in His image, but this man did not have God&rsquo;s life, nature, or intrinsic constitution. Man was a photo of God with God&rsquo;s image outwardly but without His life and nature inwardly. Eventually, God was processed by becoming a man and then being consummated to be the life-giving Spirit. He as the life-giving Spirit came into us as life to enliven and regenerate us. Regeneration is God&rsquo;s remaking, God&rsquo;s re-creation. As the processed and consummated Triune God, He came into us to be our life.</p>
<p>The consummated Triune God is different from the original Triune God. From eternity to His incarnation, He remained as God only, without the human nature. He was merely God not man. He had not yet passed through human life, death, and resurrection. From His incarnation to His resurrection, it was only about thirty-three and a half years, but in this short period of time God accomplished many great things, making Himself absolutely different from what He was before His incarnation. Before His incarnation He was only the Triune God with the divine nature. But He became a man and put on the human nature. He passed through human living, an all-inclusive death to solve all the problems and redeem us, and an all-conquering resurrection. Through this thirty-three-and-a-half-year process and consummation, He is now compounded with human nature, human living, death, and resurrection. Now He has become such a God! On the one hand, He is God; on the other hand, He is man with the experiences of human life, a wonderful death, and an all-conquering resurrection. Now this processed and consummated God enters into us as grace to regenerate us, making us a new creation.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE UNVEILING OF THE GRACE OF GOD<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Among the eight writers who participated in the unveiling of the divine revelation in the New Testament concerning the grace of God, three are particular, that is, John, Paul, and Peter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. IN JOHN&rsquo;S WRITINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. In the Unveiling of God the Father Being Life<br />
in the Son as the Spirit to the Believers</h2>
<p>In the unveiling of God the Father being life in the Son as the Spirit to the believers, John begins his writings with the grace which came with Christ in His incarnation (John 1:14-17) and ends with the grace as the consummation not only of his writings but also of the entire Scriptures. Revelation 22:21 is the last verse of the last chapter of the last book of the entire Bible. This verse says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.&rdquo; Thus, John&rsquo;s writings begin with grace and end with grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Grace Being the Triune God in His Incarnation<br />
to Be Dispensed to the Believers by the Father<br />
as the Source, by the Son as the Element,<br />
and by the Spirit as the Application</h2>
<p>This indicates that in the accomplishment of His eternal economy, God commences it in His incarnation by coming to be a man as the grace to the believers. God came in the way of incarnation to us as grace. Hence, grace is the Triune God in His incarnation to be dispensed to the believers by the Father as the source, by the Son as the element, and by the Spirit as the application (2 Cor. 13:14). The source of grace, the element of grace, and the application of grace are of the three Persons of the Divine Trinity to be our everything.</p>
<p>So, in this dispensing of God, the grace is called the grace of God (1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 1:12; 8:1; 9:14), the grace of Christ (2 Cor. 8:9; 12:9; 13:14), and the grace of which the Spirit is (Heb. 10:29). In the New Testament, phrases such as <em>the grace of God, the love of God,</em> or <em>the light of God</em> may be considered as appositional. In other words, the love of God means that the love is God. The light of God means that the light is God. The grace of God indicates that the grace is God and God is grace. Thus, grace is the Triune God by the Father as the source, by the Son as the element, and by the Spirit as the application.</p>
<p>We have to study all these new expressions. We need to consider why the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the application. The source is the very origin of grace, the element is the grace itself, and the application is the element applied to us. These are terms we have to study and remember. Then when we visit people, we can share this with them. The very Triune God is grace to us by the Father as the source, by the Son as the element, and by the Spirit as the application. Now this grace becomes ours. Eventually, it becomes us. This grace makes us God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. IN PETER&rsquo;S WRITINGS</h2>
<p>In his first Epistle Peter spoke concerning the grace of God in five aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Grace That Multiplies</h2>
<p>Peter spoke of the grace that multiplies in the believers&rsquo; daily life in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus their Lord (1 Pet. 1:2; 2 Pet. 1:2). In the full knowledge of God and the Lord, the onefold grace multiplies again and again. When a believer becomes mature in the divine life, he will enjoy a multiplication manyfold. Grace is unlimited just as God is unlimited. When we were regenerated, we received God into us, but we had only a small amount of God. Gradually, as God increases within us through the years, we will be weighty with the measure of God. This is because God as grace has been increased in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Grace of Life</h2>
<p>Peter also spoke of the grace of life that is the inheritance of all the believers, whether strong or weak (1 Pet. 3:7). Peter teaches the believing brothers to love and to sympathize with their wives because the wives as the weaker vessels are fellow heirs of the grace of life. The wives are weaker than the husbands, but both of them inherit the grace of life. This life is the Triune God Himself as our life, living in us to be our inheritance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Varied Grace of God</h2>
<p>First Peter 4:10 speaks of the varied grace of God that indicates the riches of the grace of God in its varieties ministered by the saints to one another. You minister to me one variety of grace, and I minister to you another variety.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. The All Grace</h2>
<p>Peter spoke of the all grace by which God, who has called the believers into His eternal glory, perfects, establishes, strengthens, and grounds them through their sufferings (1 Pet. 5:10). The all grace is the perfecting grace, establishing grace, strengthening grace, and grounding grace. God perfects, establishes, strengthens, and grounds us by grace through the channel of sufferings. Because of my weakness, nearly every day is a suffering day for me. But God has perfected, established, strengthened, and grounded me through sufferings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. The True Grace of God</h2>
<p>Some kinds of so-called grace are untrue; they are false. In 1 Peter 5:12 there is the true grace of God that is the all grace of God in verse 10, into which the believers should enter and in which they should stand.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. IN PAUL&rsquo;S WRITINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Grace for the Enablement of the Apostles</h2>
<p>Romans 1:5 reveals that the grace of God is for the enablement of the apostles. No one in himself is able to be an apostle, but the grace of God enables certain believers to be apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Grace for the Believers&rsquo; Living</h2>
<p>We live by grace. The grace for the believers&rsquo; living is spoken of in Romans 1:7 and in the beginning of all of Paul&rsquo;s other Epistles except Hebrews. In our Christian living, our daily life, we need the grace. Everyone has a problem with his temper. No one can overcome his temper except by grace. Who can be humble? We are always proud. We can be humble only by grace. The Lord said, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:9). &ldquo;All sufficient grace! / Never powerless!&rdquo; <em>(Hymns,</em> #312).</p>
<p>When circumstances arise to cause us to react, we have to tell ourselves to be quiet, be slow, and wait. We should not say anything or express any kind of attitude for a short time. Then the grace of God will be applied to us, and we will spontaneously become humble. Who can control his loose speaking? Some people speak quickly all the time. It is impossible to control our tongue without grace. Proverbs speaks repeatedly about the taming of the tongue. If we can control our tongue, we can reduce ninety percent of our sinfulness. The tongue can never be controlled by us in our own strength. We need the grace of God for overcoming in all the details of our daily living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Grace by Which We Are Justified</h2>
<p>Romans 3:24 speaks of the grace by which we are justified freely through the redemption in Christ Jesus. To be justified through Christ by God, we need the grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. The Grace versus Wages</h2>
<p>There is also the grace versus wages in God&rsquo;s accounting for His justification of the believers. Romans 4:4 says that when God justifies us, He does not count on what we labor for or can do as a wage to account for His justification of us. Our justification is dependent upon His grace, not upon our labor, our work. If our justification were based upon works, it would be wages to us. Justification is not a wage but a grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. The Grace for the Believers<br />
to Inherit the Promise of God</h2>
<p>Romans 4:16 says that our inheritance is out of faith that it might be according to grace. Thus, grace is for the believers to inherit the promise of God, going along with faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Grace into Which the Believers<br />
Have Entered and in Which They Stand</h2>
<p>We have entered into the grace, and we stand in it. Romans 5:2 says that through Christ &ldquo;we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Abounding Grace of God</h2>
<p>Romans also speaks of the abounding grace of God in which is the free gift of Christ (5:15, 20; 6:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. The Grace That Enables the Believers<br />
to Reign (as a King) in Life</h2>
<p>Romans 5:17 says that we can reign in life by grace. In these days we are speaking about being a God-man, about becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. To reign is to be God. In the whole universe who reigns? Who is the king? There is only one King. But we as the children of this one King can also reign in His life. Since we reign as God does, by reigning in life we become the very God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. God reigns and we reign.</p>
<p>To reign is to conquer, subdue, and rule over Satan, the world, sin, the flesh, ourselves, and all the environmental circumstances. In Romans 8 Paul says this: &ldquo;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?&rdquo; (v. 35). Then he says, &ldquo;We more than conquer through Him who loved us&rdquo; (v. 37). Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ, because we are more than conquerors over all the troubles in our environment.</p>
<p>It may be easy for people to rule over their dogs. Dogs can be very obedient. But what about our own children? Children are not as obedient as dogs. Children learn to say no before they say many other words. The main word that comes out of young children is &ldquo;No!&rdquo; How can we be kings when we cannot rule our children in the divine life? We believers who are parents must exercise ourselves to learn how to be kings in ruling our children. We must have grace to rule our children. We also have to rule over the sin within us, to rule over Satan, and to rule over the world. We should not let the world&rsquo;s fashion conquer us. Instead, we should conquer all things and reign in life by grace.</p><h2 class="head2">9. The Grace That Reigns</h2>
<p>Romans 5:21 speaks of the grace that may reign through righteousness unto eternal life. Verse 17 says that we reign by the grace in life, while verse 21 says that grace reigns unto eternal life. That means grace reigns over us and over everything so that we can enjoy the eternal life. <em>Unto</em> means &ldquo;for.&rdquo; Grace reigns for the eternal life. This means that we may gain the eternal life for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. The Grace That Constitutes<br />
the Dispensation of the New Testament</h2>
<p>Romans 6:14 and 15 speak of the grace that constitutes the dispensation of the New Testament, which is separated from the dispensation of the law of the Old Testament, and under which the believers are to overcome sin&rsquo;s lording it over them. Paul says in these verses that we are not under law but under grace. This means we are not in the dispensation of the law but in the dispensation of grace. Because we are under grace, we have to overcome our sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">11. The Grace by Which God Selected His People<br />
and Which Is versus Works</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s selection is by grace, not by works (Rom. 11:5-6). If it is by works, it is no more by grace. Jacob is a good example of God&rsquo;s selection (9:10-13). God selected Jacob, who was the twin of Esau. They were both sons of Isaac. God said that He loved Jacob, but hated Esau. Jacob cheated his father, his brother, and his uncle Laban. He was a supplanter, a cunning one, but God selected him by God&rsquo;s grace, not by Jacob&rsquo;s works.</p>
<h2 class="head2">12. The Grace by Which the Apostles<br />
Carried Out Their Ministry</h2>
<p>No one can do the works of an apostle in himself. But by grace, the apostles carried out their ministry (Rom. 12:3; 15:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">13. The Grace according to Which<br />
the Gifts Are Distributed to the Believers</h2>
<p>Romans 12:6 reveals the grace according to which the gifts are distributed to the believers; hence, grace is the basis of the gifts. On the one hand, Romans 12:6 says that the gifts differ according to the grace. Grace produces and supplies the gifts. On the other hand, Ephesians 4:7 says that the grace  is according to the gift (the gifted person). This means that grace is according to the measure of the gift. The measure of the gift is the size of a member of the Body of Christ. This is similar to our blood supplying the members of our body according to their size. The shoulder receives more blood supply than the little finger. Paul was like a big shoulder that receives more blood supply; he was a big member of the Body of Christ, so he received more grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">14. The Grace Which Is the Enjoyment of God<br />
by the Believers, under Whose Feet<br />
God Will Crush Satan</h2>
<p>Romans 16:20 says, &ldquo;Now the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.&rdquo; If there is no grace with us, God has no way to crush Satan under our feet. We must enjoy the grace of God; that gives God the ground to crush Satan.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

<p>Prayer: Lord, we believe that this meeting is of You as grace to us. We look unto You to make everything in this meeting grace. Our sharing and prophesying all would be grace. Cover us, Lord, against the enemy. You know in all these days we are in a struggle with the enemy about the release of the crystallization of Your Word. Lord, fight for Your truth, fight for us, and fight the enemy to the uttermost. Bind him and destroy him. He is the defeated foe who was defeated and destroyed on the cross. Lord, even rebuke him every day for us and destroy all his power of darkness, the evil spirits and the demons. We hide ourselves in You. Give us the word of grace to speak Your grace. We want the reality, and we know the reality of this grace as the processed and consummated Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit as God&rsquo;s consummation. Be with us in everything as this life-giving Spirit. Amen.</p>
<p>We have seen that John&rsquo;s writings begin and end with the grace of God. John shows that when God became incarnated, that was grace coming. John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh, full of grace. Then verse 17 says that the law was given through Moses but grace came. This grace in John 1:17 is personified. Grace came when God came to be a man. John&rsquo;s writings end with grace as the consummation of the entire Scriptures (Rev. 22:21).</p>
<p>After covering so many items of grace, we can see that in the New Testament, for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s economy, God was processed and consummated to become everything to His chosen people. We are nothing, and He is everything. We who come forward to God must believe that God is and we are not (Heb. 11:6). The first three commandments of the Ten Commandments are concerning God Himself (Exo. 20:1-7). The fourth commandment is concerning keeping the Sabbath (v. 8). This indicates that if we are going to receive God as everything, we must stop our work, that is, we must keep the Sabbath. The entire New Testament time is a Sabbath. The Sabbath means that God is everything, does everything, and gives everything, and man has to stop. Do not do anything, be anything, or give anything. Just receive God as everything.</p>
<p>In the last message we covered grace in the writings of John, in the writings of Peter, and we saw fourteen items concerning grace in Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Romans. Now we want to see more items of grace in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles to the Corinthians.</p><h2 class="head2">15. The Grace That Was Given<br />
to the Corinthian Believers</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:4 speaks of the grace that was given to the Corinthian believers based upon which the apostle thanked God. Paul thanked God for the grace given to them. It is the general habit of most Bible readers to take what they read in the Bible for granted. We may have read 1 Corinthians 1:4 in this way, but we need to see that Paul&rsquo;s mentioning of grace here is very significant. Since this word is in verse 4 of the first chapter of 1 Corinthians, grace must be the central subject of the book.</p>
<p>The Brethren pointed out that 1 Corinthians solves eleven problems. They thought that 1 Corinthians was a problem-solving book. But Paul said in 1:4, &ldquo;I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; In verse 9 he said that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son. This means that God has called us to participate in, or to partake of, the Son. The fellowship, the enjoyment, the participation in, and the partaking of Christ are grace. In verse 7 Paul told the Corinthians that they did not lack in any gift. To have all the gifts is the issue of grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">16. The Grace That God Gave to Paul<br />
Which Made Him a Wise Master Builder</h2>
<p>Paul received grace not only to make him an apostle but also to make him a wise master builder (1 Cor. 3:10). Paul received all the points concerning the building from God. That was of God&rsquo;s grace, which is God Himself. It was God Himself who made Paul the apostle and the wise master builder. In the Old Testament, God showed Moses the design of the tabernacle and David the design of the temple. In the New Testament, for the building up of the church, God gave the plan to Paul. We can say this because among all the writers of the New Testament, the Body of Christ is mentioned only by Paul (Eph. 1:23; Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:12). Paul saw something particular. He saw that the building of God in the whole universe for the accomplishment of His eternal economy is a Body. This revelation is so high! This Body is constructed with God&rsquo;s elect as the framework and with God as the contents&mdash;the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence (Eph. 4:4-6).</p>
<p>The real building work of this Body of Christ is the Body&rsquo;s growth (vv. 15-16). The Body of Christ is not built in an organizational way but in the way of growth. When a child is born, he is very small, but after many years he may become very big and tall. His growth is what built him up. Only Paul touched this matter because he was the master builder. He knew the design of God&rsquo;s building, so we have to come to him to receive this revelation. The design he saw is fully shown part by part throughout his fourteen Epistles. We have to pick up all these parts and put them together, just like putting the parts of a jigsaw puzzle together, to give us the proper picture.</p>
<h2 class="head2">17. The Grace That Made Paul an Apostle<br />
Who Labored More Abundantly<br />
Than All the Other Apostles</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, &ldquo;But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.&rdquo; This shows the grace that made Paul an apostle who labored more abundantly than all the other apostles; such a grace was God Himself working through the apostle. &ldquo;Not I but the grace of God&rdquo; equals &ldquo;no longer I...but...Christ&rdquo; in Galatians 2:20. This shows that Christ Himself is the grace of God. We all have to declare that in our labor it is not us, but the grace of God with us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">18. The Grace Which Is the Lord Jesus Christ<br />
Himself and Which Is Always with All the Believers</h2>
<p>The closing word of 1 Corinthians is: &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you&rdquo; (16:23). This indicates that grace has brought all of us in and grace has built all of us together. The brothers who are trainers and co-workers in our full-time training in Anaheim were brought together by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread to all the continents. All the churches from these continents invite brothers to go out from Anaheim. It seems that every place looks to Anaheim. The only thing we in Anaheim can look to is the Lord&rsquo;s grace. We are nothing, but He is everything. Grace is everything. No one can bear such a burden as we are bearing here in Anaheim for the full-time training, for the churches in our area, and for the Lord&rsquo;s work everywhere. We need Christ as the all-sufficient grace. This grace is going out, working, and building up God&rsquo;s desire, that is, the Body of Christ to be consummated in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When God created the old creation with Adam, He said, &ldquo;Very good&rdquo; (Gen. 1:31). But when our God sees the New Jerusalem, He may jump up and say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, very, very good! It&rsquo;s excellent!&rdquo; The New Jerusalem is the enlargement of God. This city is the produce of God, who has been processed and consummated. The only One who can work this out is God Himself as grace to be everything to us.</p><h2 class="head2">19. The Grace by Which the Apostles<br />
Conducted Themselves in the World</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:12 Paul said, &ldquo;For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.&rdquo; We should not think that we need grace only to go to work. We need grace in the way that we conduct ourselves all the time. People in the worldly society always play politics, but we cannot do this. We must conduct ourselves by singleness and sincerity. We must be so simple, so strict. When we say yes, we mean yes. When we say no, we mean no. Also, we do not conduct ourselves by man&rsquo;s fleshly wisdom. In today&rsquo;s world people always do things by their wisdom. But the apostles conducted themselves not by human wisdom but by the grace of God.</p>
<p>When I came into the work in 1933, the Lord impressed me to learn to be single and sincere and not to play any politics among the co-workers or encounter anything by my wisdom. This is what it means to conduct ourselves by God&rsquo;s grace. <em>By God&rsquo;s grace</em> means by God. We should conduct ourselves by the processed, consummated God as the life-giving Spirit. This is why Paul said we must do everything according to the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4). This is to conduct ourselves by the processed God as the Spirit, who is the very grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">20. The Apostle Paul&rsquo;s Visitation<br />
to the Corinthian Believers Being Considered<br />
as Grace, Which Is God Himself</h2>
<p>Paul told the Corinthians that his coming to them a second time was so that they would have a second grace, a double grace (2 Cor. 1:15). All of the co-workers have to realize that their going to a certain place must be a grace. Your visitation is a grace because you bring God there. You bring God there because you are God there in life and nature but not in the Godhead. If you go to a place as Judas, who betrayed Christ, that would mean that your visitation is evil. When we go to visit any place, we should not exercise our wisdom; we should conduct ourselves only in singleness and sincerity by the grace of God. Then we can be assured that our going is a grace, and this grace is God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">21. The Grace Which Abounded through<br />
the Greater Number, Causing the Thanksgiving<br />
to Abound to the Glory of God</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:15 says, &ldquo;For all things are for your sakes that the grace which has abounded through the greater number may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.&rdquo; We want to see the increase, because the grace abounds and is more greatly manifested through a greater number. With only ten saints, the abounding grace cannot be manifested so much and the thanksgiving cannot abound. When the number is greater, the grace is manifested more and the thanksgiving for the grace is abounding to the glory of God. The increase in number should not be our boast. It is for the increase of the grace to produce the increase and the abounding thanksgiving to God, to the glory of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">22. The Grace Which the Believers<br />
Should Not Receive in Vain</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 6:1 Paul entreated the believers not to receive God&rsquo;s grace in vain. Not to receive the grace of God in vain, according to the context, means not to remain in any condition that is a distraction from God, but to be brought back to Him. It is wrong to have the presence of God and to enjoy God in vain.</p>
<h2 class="head2">23. The Surpassing Grace of God<br />
Given to the Macedonian Churches</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians reveals the surpassing grace of God given to the Macedonian churches by God, which was the cause of their liberality in giving (8:1-2; 9:14). The Macedonians were very poor. They were constrained financially, but when they heard that the Jewish brothers in Palestine lacked food and clothing, they gave with liberality. The surpassing grace caused them to have the liberality. Thus, their liberality was a grace and an expression of God.</p><h2 class="head2">24. The Grace That Became the Fellowship<br />
of the Macedonian Churches to Minister<br />
to the Need of the Saints</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 8:4 speaks of &ldquo;the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints.&rdquo; This grace became the fellowship of the Macedonian churches in giving, the fellowship in liberality, to minister to the need of the saints. To send the material supply from Greece to Palestine at Paul&rsquo;s time, close to two thousand years ago, was not an easy thing. It may have taken over two months for this supply to arrive by ship. Also, it took a number of months for Paul&rsquo;s letters to reach those to whom he wrote. For them to reply to his letters took even longer. Today it is much different. We can use fax machines to send people letters immediately and get an immediate response from them. The co-workers in Moscow fellowship with me quite often in this way. But even in Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;awkward&rdquo; age, in which transportation and communication were slow and inconvenient, the Macedonians, under the apostle Paul&rsquo;s leading, ministered to the need of the distant saints. That grace became a fellowship. Because of the modern conveniences which we enjoy today, our liberality must be a &ldquo;quicker&rdquo; grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">25. The Grace That Is a Business in Which<br />
All the Believers Should Participate<br />
for Its Accomplishment</h2>
<p>Grace is a business in which all the believers should participate for its accomplishment (2 Cor. 8:6-7). Today there should be traffic, fellowship, among all the local churches on earth. This is the fellowship of the Body of Christ, and this is &ldquo;international trade.&rdquo; This is a business. Nearly every day I receive letters by fax from different directions. A kind of business is going on, a business of grace. This is an international trade of grace. Grace first becomes the fellowship, and the fellowship, the traffic, becomes a business. This is the busiest international trade.</p>
<p>When I receive letters from the brothers, this is the grace incarnated to be the business, and this incarnation is God. When the fax letters come to me from the brothers, that means God comes. Paul went to a place to visit and that was grace. So when the brothers send me letters, that means they come to visit me by letters. That is also grace; that is fellowship; that is business.</p>
<h2 class="head2">26. The Grace That Is<br />
the Lord Jesus Christ&rsquo;s Becoming Poor<br />
That the Believers May Become Rich</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 8:9 says, &ldquo;For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become rich.&rdquo; By becoming poor, Christ gave Himself to us to be our riches. If He had never lived in Nazareth in that poor environment to be a poor carpenter, how could He be our riches? This is all grace. Grace means &ldquo;God is everything, God does everything, God gives everything.&rdquo; What do we have, that we have not received? We have received everything. We receive grace upon grace, and this grace is God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">27. The All Grace Which God Causes<br />
to Abound unto the Believers</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 9:8 speaks of the all grace which God causes to abound unto the believers that, in everything always having all sufficiency, they may abound unto every good work. This grace is God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">28. The Sufficient Grace of Christ<br />
to the Apostle Paul</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:9 we see the sufficient grace of Christ to the apostle Paul as the power of Christ that was perfected in weakness and that overshadowed the apostle. God gave the apostle Paul many high revelations, so God was concerned for him that he might be proud in receiving these many revelations. God had even brought him to the third heaven and to Paradise to hear unspeakable words, which it was not allowed for a man to speak (vv. 2-4). So God gave him a thorn, which was a messenger of Satan, an evil spirit, to buffet him all the time (v. 7). Paul prayed three times for the thorn to be removed, but the Lord would not remove it. Instead, He told Paul, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). No one could bear such a thorn, but the Lord&rsquo;s grace could. This all-sufficient grace became the power to sustain and support Paul. It also overshadowed him, tabernacled over him, to protect and cover him. Thus, the all-sufficient grace does two things. First, it supports, sustains, and strengthens us positively; this is offensive. Second, it covers and protects us; this is defensive. This all-sufficient grace is Christ, and Christ is the processed, consummated Triune God to be the Spirit. Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). We revised the chorus of Hymn #312 in our hymnal (<em>Hymns</em>) to read: &ldquo;All sufficient grace! / Never powerless! / It is Christ who lives in me, / In His exhaustlessness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">29. The Grace of the Lord Jesus, of Which<br />
the Love of God Is the Source and the Fellowship<br />
of the Holy Spirit Is the Application</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Grace is the Triune God becoming our enjoyment. The source of this grace is God; the element of this grace is Christ; and this grace being applied to us and reaching us is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, the Third of the Divine Trinity.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

<p>Prayer: Lord, we still look unto You. Only You know how much we need You. We need You to know Your holy Word. We do not want to know it just according to the dead letters. We want to know it according to Yourself as the Spirit. Lord, we are here again to cover twenty items of Your grace in six books. How much could we say, and what should we say? We look unto You. Lord, we have to confess that we still have shortcomings and mistakes. O Lord, forgive us. We are still quite contaminated. We need Your cleansing. Forgive us and cleanse us that we might be kept in the fellowship with You. Lord, we pray that the entire meeting would be a fellowship in the fellowship of God. Be with each one of us. Speak the same word, yet meet the particular need of all the saints. Amen.</p>
<p>In this message we want to continue our fellowship on the grace of God. Grace is covered throughout the New Testament, but the same word <em>grace</em> differs in its meaning according to the book in which it is mentioned. The grace in Galatians is different from the grace in Ephesians. This is because every book has its background and its goal. Grace in a certain book is used for that book&rsquo;s particular background and goal. We may say that we already know that grace is God becoming our enjoyment, but this is inadequate. This is a self-deceiving satisfaction. We must realize that the Word of God is deep, especially the word <em>grace.</em> In order for us to know what grace is in each book, we must get into the background and the goal of that book. In Romans grace is used with a different denotation in every chapter.</p>
<p>In this message we will cover twenty more points concerning the grace of God in six books: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and the two Thessalonians. Nearly every point needs a conference to be covered thoroughly. Because we do not have that much time, the only way we can take is to share the principles. We have to spend some time to get into the depths of the Word by keeping the principles.</p><h2 class="head2">30. The Grace of Christ by Which God Called<br />
the Galatian Believers to the Gospel<br />
according to God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>Galatians 1:6 speaks of the grace of Christ by which God called the Galatian believers to the gospel according to God&rsquo;s economy. The grace is of Christ; the calling is by God to the gospel. In order to know grace here, we have to know the entire book of Galatians. The entire book of Galatians shows us that the Galatians were under the law in the dispensation of law. One day a man sent by God sounded the trumpet to call the Galatians out of the law&rsquo;s bondage to the gospel according to God&rsquo;s economy. This means grace in Galatians is for the believers to be built up in God&rsquo;s economy. This building up is to bring the believers out of bondage into the freedom of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">31. The Grace through Which<br />
God Called the Apostle Paul</h2>
<p>God called the Galatians and He called the apostle Paul through the grace (Gal. 1:15). This means that God called the apostle to minister His economy to the Galatians to call them out. The called one ministered grace to many called ones. Grace simply means that God comes in to replace man. Law is man doing everything to replace God. The law means man comes in and God is out. Grace means God comes in and man is out. Man must keep the Sabbath. God worked six days for man&rsquo;s enjoyment. Now there is no need for man to do anything but enjoy. This is grace. Grace is God coming in to replace man. This corresponds with Hebrews 11:6, which reveals that we are to believe that God is and we are not. This is grace.</p>
<p>In one sense, we who have been graced do not need to do anything. But in another sense, we have to cooperate with God and coordinate with God. We have become one with God. God lives in us and with us. We live in God and with God. God initiates everything. Now we should just cooperate with Him. We do not need to do anything. Instead, we must learn all the time to cooperate and coordinate with the Triune God. He does everything for the accomplishment of His economy to bring us out of the negative things and into the positive things that we may become the members of Christ and the God-men.</p>
<h2 class="head2">32. The Grace That Was Given to the Apostle Paul<br />
and Realized by James, Cephas, and John</h2>
<p>Grace was given to the apostle Paul, and this grace differed from the grace given to James, Cephas, and John (Gal. 2:9). Peter&rsquo;s two Epistles are a total of only eight chapters. I love his writing, especially the first four verses of 2 Peter 1. But regardless of how marvelous Peter&rsquo;s writings are, they are not as mysterious in the Divine Trinity as John&rsquo;s writings are. In John 14&mdash;16 we see the mystery of the Triune God building Himself into His believers to make His believers His house, the vine tree, and the new man. Eventually, John saw the big mystery of the New Jerusalem, which became the conclusion of the Bible. Although John saw these marvelous and mysterious things, he was not as complete, as perfect, as Paul was. Paul was the most complete, perfect, apostle.</p>
<p>If Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles were taken away from the Bible, not much would be left. John, Peter, and James did not use the term <em>the Body of Christ.</em> Only Paul spoke of the Body. The Body of Christ is the center, the reality, and the goal of God&rsquo;s economy. Grace was given to Paul in carrying out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which was much different from the grace given to James, and which was much greater, higher, and deeper than the grace given to Peter and John.</p>
<p>James, Peter, and John realized the grace given to Paul. This is why Peter deeply recommended Paul to the believers in 2 Peter 3:15-16. This shows that the grace given to you and me can be seen and realized by others. Grace is God coming in to replace man. This grace comes to one person in one sense and to another person in another sense.</p>
<h2 class="head2">33. The Grace through Which Paul Was Justified</h2>
<p>Paul said that he was justified by the grace of God, not by the law (Gal. 2:21). He was justified by believing in Christ, not by carrying out the law, so he said that he would not nullify the grace of God. In Galatians two words are very negative. One is that we can nullify God&rsquo;s grace, making God&rsquo;s grace of no effect. Another is that we can be fallen from grace (5:4). Many today are not fallen from grace but are nullifying grace. You may say, &ldquo;I am still in the church life. At least I go to the meeting once a week. I am still remaining in grace.&rdquo; But you have nullified grace. No one can see grace upon you in an effective way. Paul said that he was justified by grace and that he did not nullify the grace he had received in Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">34. The Grace from Which<br />
the Galatian Believers Had Fallen</h2>
<p>The Galatian believers fell from grace because they went back to the law for their justification (5:4). They wanted to be justified by their keeping of the law. By doing this, they fell away from the grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">35. The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ<br />
Which Was in the Spirit of the Galatian<br />
Believers for Their Remaining in<br />
God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>Galatians 6:18 says, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.&rdquo; Paul closed the book of Galatians in this way because the Galatians forgot about the indwelling Spirit. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is the bountiful supply of the Triune God (who is embodied in the Son and realized as the life-giving Spirit) enjoyed by us through the exercise of our human spirit. Paul, in his conclusion, reminded the believers in Galatia that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ was in their spirit. Grace is not objective but very subjective. Grace is in our spirit for our remaining in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. If we fall away from grace, we have nothing to do with God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Grace nearly equals the New Testament economy of God, just as the law nearly equals the Old Testament economy of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">36. The Rich Grace of God<br />
with Which He Graced the Believers</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:6 and 7 speak of the rich grace of God with which God graced us, the believers, in three main things: in choosing us, predestinating us, and redeeming us. Of course, these three things issued in a big result. God&rsquo;s choosing, predestinating, and His redeeming in Christ produced the Body of Christ (vv. 22-23). These three things are in the first part of the first chapter of Ephesians. But from the second part of the first chapter of Ephesians to the last chapter, the big issue of these three items is the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">37. The Grace by Which the Believers Have Been<br />
Saved through the Death and Resurrection<br />
of Christ and of Which the Surpassing Riches<br />
Might Be Displayed in the Ages to Come</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:5-8 speaks of the grace by which the believers have been saved through the death and resurrection of Christ and of which the surpassing riches might be displayed in the ages to come. This rich grace will be for the display, the exhibition, in eternity. In other words, the New Jerusalem will be a big show, a big exhibition, to display the rich grace of God, which has done everything to produce the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">38. The Grace of Which the Apostle Paul<br />
Was Given the Stewardship by God to Carry Out<br />
His New Testament Economy in Christ</h2>
<p>Paul was given the stewardship of the grace of God to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in Christ (Eph. 3:2, 7-9). The stewardship is the service of a steward, who is a family servant. With Paul the stewardship from God became very great. The stewardship of the grace is for the dispensing of the grace of God to His chosen people for the producing and building up of the church. The grace came upon the apostle Paul, making Paul one who knew that God does everything to replace man. Even though Paul labored more than all the apostles, he said that it was not him but the grace. This was his stewardship for the accomplishment of the economy of God in Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">39. The Grace Which Is Given to the Believers<br />
according to What Kind of Gifts (Gifted Persons)<br />
They Are in the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:7 says, &ldquo;To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.&rdquo; The gift here refers to a gifted person. The measure of the gift of Christ is the size of a member of His Body. Paul was a big gifted person, a big member, so the grace he received was big. This may be likened to the members of our physical body receiving more or less of the blood supply based upon their size. Our shoulder and little finger receive the same blood, but the shoulder receives more blood than our little finger does.</p>
<p>Romans 12:6 says that the gifts differ according to the grace. On the one hand, the size of the gifted persons determines how much grace is given. On the other hand, the gift is according to the grace because the grace produces and supplies the gifts. The more you grow, the more grace you have and the more gift you have. As we grow in grace, our gifts are developed. This is why the gifts are according to the grace. They come out of the grace. In Ephesians the grace is given according to the gift; the grace will be given to you according to what kind of member you are.</p>
<h2 class="head2">40. The Grace concerning the Entire Salvation<br />
of Christ Which Is Ministered to Others out of<br />
the Believers&rsquo; Mouth in Their Common Talk</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:29 says, &ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; This grace is concerning the entire salvation of Christ, which is ministered to others out of our mouth, even our common talk. We must admit that in our daily life we do not minister much grace to others in our speaking. We must learn not to speak wasted words. Instead, every word should minister the grace of God as a part of the entire salvation of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">41. The Grace That Is with Those<br />
Who Love the Lord in Incorruptibility</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:24 says, &ldquo;Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility.&rdquo; This is a hard phrase for us to understand in the Bible. We may say that we love the Lord, but our love may be merely in our emotion, in our likes and dislikes. Much of what we like and dislike is corrupt. There is no incorruptibility in our emotion.</p>
<p><em>Incorruptibility</em> in Ephesians 6 refers to all the crucial items in the foregoing chapters. In chapter one are the choosing and predestinating of the Father, the redemption of the Son, the sealing of the Spirit, and the Body of Christ. In chapter two there is the new man. In chapter three there is Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our hearts unto the fullness of God. In chapter four there are the building up of the Body, the oneness of the Body, the framework of the Body, and the Triune God as the contents of the Body. In chapter five there is the church as the wife of Christ, and in chapter six there is the church as God&rsquo;s warrior with the full armor of God. All these positive things mentioned in the six chapters of Ephesians are incorruptible. We should love the Lord Jesus according to all the incorruptible items mentioned in the six chapters of Ephesians. Our love for the Lord should not be merely according to our emotion. Instead, we must love the Lord in the divine, heavenly, and spiritual realities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">42. The Grace of Which the Philippian Believers<br />
Were Partakers with the Apostle Paul<br />
Both in His Bonds and in His Defense<br />
and Confirmation of the Gospel</h2>
<p>In Philippians 1:7 Paul said that the Philippians shared his grace in his bonds and in his defense and confirmation of the gospel. This is because they cooperated with Paul, and they were his partners in grace.</p><h2 class="head2">43. The Grace Which Was with the Spirit<br />
of the Philippian Believers</h2>
<p>Philippians 4:23 speaks of the grace which was with the spirit of the Philippian believers in their experiences of Christ when the church was under persecution. When the church was under persecution, the Philippian believers kept on experiencing Christ by the Spirit within them, and that Spirit was the grace. The grace with the spirit of the Philippian believers was the Spirit. We have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ to experience Christ and to magnify Christ, regardless of how much persecution there is toward the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">44. The Grace Which the Colossian Believers<br />
Heard and Knew in Truth</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:6 speaks of the Colossian believers&rsquo; hearing and knowing the grace of God in truth. When the Colossian believers heard the gospel, they knew the grace in truth. This grace is the very God distributed and dispensed to us for our possession and enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">45. The Grace Which the Apostle Paul<br />
Exhorted the Believers in Colossae<br />
to Sing with in Their Hearts</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:16 Paul exhorted the believers in Colossae to sing with grace in their hearts when the word of Christ dwelt in them richly in all wisdom by their teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. We are short in our experience of Christ because we do not sing that much with grace in our hearts. We do not have much experience of teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Mostly we sing only when we come together. We need to sing in our daily life. Perhaps a wife could sing to her husband, &ldquo;All sufficient grace! / Never powerless! / It is Christ who lives in me, / In His exhaustlessness&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #312). Then the husband can sing another chorus. If a husband says to his wife, &ldquo;Dear, you should not give your long face to me so many times every day&rdquo; the wife may say, &ldquo;Then you should not come back home so late every day!&rdquo; Instead of speaking in this corrupt way, the husbands and wives should sing and minister grace to each other.</p>
<h2 class="head2">46. The Grace with Which the Believers&rsquo; Speech<br />
Should Always Be, Seasoned with Salt, That They<br />
May Know How They Ought to Answer Each One</h2>
<p>Colossians 4:6 says, &ldquo;Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.&rdquo; This lesson is a big one. You may say the same thing, but your tone and way may be different. If you say something to your wife in the wrong tone and way, you will offend her. If you say the same thing in another kind of tone and way, you will show love to your wife. This is to speak wisdom and grace. The grace here is the salt. Salt makes food agreeable and pleasant to the taste. Speech seasoned with salt keeps us at peace with one another (Mark 9:50).</p>
<h2 class="head2">47. The Grace That Kept the Thessalonian Saints<br />
Sanctified Wholly and Preserved Complete<br />
in Their Spirit, Soul, and Body</h2>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:23-28 reveals the grace that sanctifies us wholly and preserves us complete in our spirit, soul, and body. Such a sanctification is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">48. The Grace according to Which the Name of<br />
the Lord Jesus Was Glorified in the Thessalonian<br />
Saints and They Were Glorified in Him</h2>
<p>When the name of the Lord Jesus is glorified in us according to the grace, we also are glorified (2 Thes. 1:12). This should be done by God coming in to replace us. Many times our words did not glorify Christ, so His name was not glorified in us and we were not glorified. We have to say something to glorify the name of the Lord, and at the same time to glorify ourselves. This can be done only by the grace, which is God coming in to replace us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">49. The Grace in Which the Lord Jesus Christ<br />
and God the Father Loved the Thessalonian<br />
Saints and Gave Them Eternal Comfort and Good<br />
Hope and Would Comfort Their Hearts and<br />
Establish Them in Every Good Work and Word</h2>
<p>Second Thessalonians 2:16 and 17 say, &ldquo;Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope in grace, comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.&rdquo; By reading the apostles&rsquo; writings, especially Paul&rsquo;s writings, we can see that a proper God-man lives in everything by God Himself coming in to replace him. We must do everything by grace, and grace is God coming in to replace us. If your wife asks you, &ldquo;Dear, why did you come home so late?&rdquo; do not answer right away. You have to look to the Lord by praying, &ldquo;Lord, You give me the word for my wife.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s word in 2 Thessalonians 2:16 and 17 means that we have to live, to have our being, all the time by grace, by letting God come in to replace us.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

</ol>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You. What an enjoyment it is that we can come together to study what You are as grace. Lord, You know that we do not have the utterance. In our natural language there is not this kind of utterance. Lord, give us the utterance. We look unto You. Even, Lord, for us to listen, we need You. We need You as our understanding. Have mercy upon us. We should not think that grace is a term known to everybody. We have to realize that hardly any of us fully understands what grace is. O Lord Jesus, help us in this matter. We cannot take Your word for granted. We have to get into it. Lord, we are crystallizing the grace of God in the book of Romans. We need Your utterance. We need Your speaking in our speaking. Be one spirit with us. Amen.</p>
<p>Our general subject is the crystallization of the gospel of God in the Epistle to the Romans. We have studied the verses concerning grace in Romans. Then we have gone on to see more concerning grace in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles from 1 Corinthians through 2 Thessalonians. Now we want to see the grace of God from 1 Timothy through Hebrews.</p>
<p>We may wonder why we are considering grace in other books of the New Testament, since we are on the crystallization-study of the book of Romans. This is because although all the writers of the New Testament touch the grace of God, except Matthew and Mark, Romans is the center and the framework of God&rsquo;s grace. It is in Romans that we are told grace is God personified. Romans 5:21 says that grace reigns, and this grace is God. The same verse says that sin reigns. Sin is Satan personified. Sin is an evil person, Satan, and this personified Satan reigns. Now God also reigns in His personification of grace. Romans 5:21 says that grace reigns unto eternal life. The New Jerusalem is grace reigning. Grace as God will reign in the New Jerusalem, so the New Jerusalem is the consummation of God reigning as grace.</p>
<p>The New Testament is a history of grace as God moving and living in and among the believers. The Jews and Muslims think that they understand God, but they do not really know Him. Even though you read the Bible many times, you still cannot fully know God until you get the crystallization of the New Testament. Who can know God to the depths of what He is without knowing the crystallization of the important items in the New Testament? The New Testament shows us that grace first is God conceived in Mary. God came to Mary in visitation as grace, which was the very factor of Mary&rsquo;s conception of the incarnated God. She found this grace (Luke 1:28, 30). If we do not know all the verses concerning grace in the New Testament in a crystallized sense, we cannot know God in a complete way. The greatest help that the full-time trainees receive is in knowing God. In these messages we are seeing and being perfected to know God as grace.</p><h2 class="head2">50. The Grace of the Lord Which Superabounded<br />
with Faith and Love in Christ</h2>
<p>If there were no grace of God, none of us could have faith and love in Christ. It is a wonder that we can believe in Jesus and love Him whom we have never seen. If we were threatened and persecuted unto martyrdom, we still could not deny that we believe in Jesus and love Him. This is a result of superabounding grace. It is not a small thing for a sinner to believe in Christ and to continue in loving Him. Many clever and wise people have been convinced, subdued, and eventually caught by the Lord&rsquo;s superabounding grace. One day when John Nelson Darby was over eighty years old, he stayed overnight in a hotel. Before going to sleep, he said, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You.&rdquo; This story nearly brought me to tears. It is marvelous that an old man, staying in a hotel, would say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You.&rdquo; To love Jesus is a wonder. To love Jesus is a miracle of the superabounding grace.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s grace superabounded with faith and love in Christ to the apostle Paul for his dynamic and excellent salvation that he might be one of the greatest apostles (1 Tim. 1:14). According to Paul&rsquo;s history in the New Testament, he was Saul of Tarsus, a strong and very knowledgeable person opposing Jesus. One day he changed from opposing to believing and loving. This was because the grace of the Lord was superabounding to him to make him an apostle. The three &ldquo;T&rdquo; books&mdash;1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus&mdash;are on the apostleship, and an apostle is produced by the superabounding grace of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">51. The Grace with Timothy That Enabled Him<br />
to Guard the Deposit and Turn Away<br />
from Profane, Vain Babblings and Antitheses<br />
of What Was Falsely Called Knowledge,<br />
Not Misaiming concerning the Faith</h2>
<p>First Timothy 6:20 and 21 speak of the grace with Timothy that enabled him to guard the deposit. Timothy had received the deposit of God&rsquo;s grace, mainly through Paul and his teaching. Something had been deposited into Timothy. Now Timothy needed to guard it by the grace.</p>
<p>By this grace he was also enabled to turn away from profane and vain babblings and antitheses of what was falsely called knowledge. The words <em>antithesis</em> and <em>knowledge</em> were used by Paul to describe the Gnostic teachings. The Gnostics thought they were men of wisdom. They tried to convince people by antithesis, that is, by contrasting and comparing two things. At Paul&rsquo;s time the Gnostic teachings in the way of antitheses were prevailing. They called that their knowledge, but Paul said it was falsely called knowledge. This took away some believers. This is why Paul charged Timothy to turn away from this knowledge of the Gnostics&rsquo; antitheses, not misaiming concerning the faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">52. The Grace according to Which God Had<br />
Saved the Apostles and Called Them with a Holy<br />
Calling and Which Was Given to Them in<br />
Christ Jesus before the Times of the Ages</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 1:9 says that grace was given to the apostles before the times of the ages. It was the same with us. Ephesians 1 says that we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world (v. 4). Before the times of the ages, God chose and predestinated us, so we received grace then.</p>
<h2 class="head2">53. The Grace Which Is in Christ Jesus<br />
and in Which Timothy, One of the Younger<br />
Co-workers of the Apostle Paul, Was Empowered<br />
in the Degradation of the Church</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:1 Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; While the church was degrading, Timothy was empowered to stand against that degradation. He could do this by the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</p><h2 class="head2">54. The Grace Which Was with Timothy<br />
through the Lord in His Spirit</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 4:22, the last verse of 2 Timothy, says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.&rdquo; First, we must have the Lord in our spirit. Then we have grace. Grace is not in our mind, emotion, or will but in our spirit where the Lord Jesus is. Actually the Lord and grace are one. Grace is the Lord personified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">55. The Grace of God Which Has Appeared<br />
to Bring Salvation to All Men</h2>
<p>Titus 2:11-13 speaks of the grace of God which has appeared to bring salvation to all men, training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age, awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. <em>Soberly</em> is toward ourselves; <em>righteously,</em> toward others; and <em>godly,</em> toward God. We have to be sober people. Actually, the worldly people are drunk. They are not sober, but foolish. Before we were saved, we did things foolishly, but now we have become sober toward ourselves. Only those who live by God as grace can deny ungodliness and worldly lusts to live a life of soberness, righteousness, and godliness in this age. We live such a life while we are awaiting the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is our great God and our Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head2">56. The Grace of God by Which We Have Been<br />
Justified That We Might Become Heirs<br />
according to the Hope of Eternal Life</h2>
<p>God justified us by His grace that we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life (Titus 3:7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">57. The Grace Which Was with the Believers<br />
Who Loved the Apostles in Faith</h2>
<p>Even to love the apostles in faith, we need the grace (Titus 3:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">58. The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ<br />
Which Was in Philemon&rsquo;s Spirit Enabling<br />
Him to Receive Onesimus, Who Was<br />
His Escaped Slave, as a Brother</h2>
<p>Philemon had the grace of the Lord in his spirit, and this grace enabled him to receive Onesimus, his escaped slave, as a brother (Philem. 25). In ancient times there were the ranks of master and slave, but Philemon&rsquo;s escaped slave was saved through Paul. Paul sent him back as a brother to his master. Ordinarily, a runaway slave would have been put to death, but Paul entreated Philemon to receive his escaped slave as a brother. This needed grace. From that time on these two were brothers, not master and slave.</p>
<h2 class="head2">59. The Grace of God by Which Christ Tasted<br />
Death on Behalf of Everything (Every Man)</h2>
<p>By the grace of God, Christ tasted death for everything, that is, for every person (Heb. 2:9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">60. The Grace That Is Found for Timely<br />
Help by the Believers Who Come<br />
Forward to the Throne of Grace</h2>
<p>When the believers come to the throne of grace, they receive grace as their timely help (Heb. 4:16). We all have to receive such grace by coming forward to the throne of grace.</p><h2 class="head2">61. The Grace of Which the Spirit Is<br />
and with Which the Spirit Worked within<br />
the Staggering Hebrew Believers, Who Were<br />
Insulting the Spirit by Shrinking Back to Their<br />
Judaism from God&rsquo;s New Testament Salvation</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:29 says, &ldquo;By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?&rdquo; The Spirit of grace was insulted by the Hebrew believers, who shrank back to their Judaism from God&rsquo;s New Testament salvation. By doing this they trampled underfoot the Son of God and considered the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified a common thing. This means that the Hebrew believers, after receiving Christ, still went back to Judaism to offer the sacrifices. By doing that they considered the blood of Christ common, not particular. This was an insult to Christ as the Spirit of grace. This was an insult not only to the Spirit but also to the grace. They had turned away from grace back to Judaism.</p>
<h2 class="head2">62. The Grace of God from Which the Believers<br />
Fall Away because of Their Not Looking Carefully</h2>
<p>Day and night we have to look carefully that we may not fall away from the grace of God (Heb. 12:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">63. The Grace Which Was Received by Those<br />
Who Had Received an Unshakable Kingdom<br />
and through Which They Might Serve God<br />
Well-pleasingly with Piety and Fear</h2>
<p>We received grace with an unshakable kingdom. Now through this grace we serve God well-pleasingly, with piety and fear (Heb. 12:28).</p>
<h2 class="head2">64. The Grace by Which the Heart<br />
of Those Who Would Not Be Carried Away<br />
by Various Strange Teachings Was Confirmed</h2>
<p>If we want to have our heart confirmed, we must trust in the grace (Heb. 13:9). To be confirmed by grace is to remain in the new covenant to enjoy Christ as grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">65. The Grace Which Was with<br />
the Hebrew Believers to Keep Them<br />
from Shrinking Back to Their Old Religion<br />
from God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>To be kept from shrinking back to Judaism from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the Hebrew believers needed grace (Heb. 13:25).</p>
<p>Grace is God Himself as everything to us. All the heavenly, spiritual, divine, and deep things are God Himself. Grace is the personified God. The New Testament is the history of such a personified Person. This Person is the Triune God in His Trinity processed and consummated. Today He is not the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God, but the &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; God. <em>Processed and consummated</em> means cooked. If God had remained in His original situation as the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God, how could He be anything to us? But in the New Testament, God is hundreds of items to us because He was processed. If God had not been incarnated and had not passed through human living, an all-inclusive death, and an all-surpassing resurrection, He could never do anything for us, give anything to us, or be anything to us. But today He can do everything for us, give everything to us, and be everything to us because He has been processed and consummated.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; This is the processed and consummated Triune God becoming constituted into the believers to make a divine and human constitution. The consummation of this constitution will be the New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we would never stop our worshipping of You as the speaking God. Thank You for Your spoken word and also for Your written Word that constitutes the Bible. Hallelujah! In this universe on this earth there is the Bible! What a wonder and what a grace! Even though Your Word has been spoken and written, we do not understand it that much. We understand it mostly according to the black and white, according to the letter. We have not entered into the intrinsic revelation that is conveyed in every word, especially in the crucial words, and the most crucial word is <em>grace.</em> For many years we have read through Your written Word, and we have taken many of the verses on grace for granted. We would never ask what they mean. We just read them and even recite them without the intrinsic understanding of what You are saying. Thank You for Your sovereign arrangement that we could have such a meeting week after week to get into the crystallization of Your deep Word, of the depths of Your revelation. Here is our prayer. We need You. We need You to be our understanding. How we long to see this matter of grace! We cannot speak because of the shortage of human language. We trust in You for the speaking. O Lord, be our speaking, be the speaking in our speaking. Be one spirit with us, and make us one spirit with You. We are not teaching people the Bible in the way of a Bible study. We are here seeking what is on Your heart, in Your desire, in Your pleasure, which is conveyed in Your Word. We trust in You. Amen.</p>
<p>Thus far, we have covered grace in the New Testament with three main writers: John, Peter, and Paul. John is the one who initiates and ends the New Testament concerning grace. Peter is rich in his writing concerning grace. But the most complete, perfect, and rich one is the apostle Paul in his fourteen Epistles. In this message we want to cover the gleanings in the vast field of God&rsquo;s grace. The field of God&rsquo;s grace is so vast that we need a gleaning.</p>
<p>In the typology of the Old Testament, there is a wonderful pattern of gleaning in the story of Ruth. Ruth was eventually married to Boaz through her gleaning in Boaz&rsquo;s field. Boaz was very rich, kind, and generous. He purposely left some sheaves on the field and scattered them for the people to glean. In the Old Testament, God&rsquo;s commandment to Israel concerning the reaping of the harvest was that Jehovah would bless the children of Israel if they left the corners of their fields and the gleanings for the poor, the sojourners, the orphans, and the widows (Lev. 23:22; 19:9-10; Deut. 24:19). Today we all are Ruths. We have become poor. We do not have a field, nor can we have a harvest like Boaz&rsquo;s. But thank God that we can carry out the gleaning.</p>
<p>This is similar to the case of the Canaanite woman who came to the Lord Jesus for help. The Lord Jesus said that it was not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the little dogs (Matt. 15:26). But she responded, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo; table&rdquo; (v. 27). She was saying that she had the right to glean. Day by day I feel that I am like a Canaanite dog who is gleaning of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>In a sense, we have harvested the field of God&rsquo;s grace. Now we need to come to the corners of this field to glean the riches of grace from the books of the New Testament which we have not covered. Only two writers of the New Testament do not mention grace: Matthew and Mark. Although John speaks of grace, he does not mention grace in his first and third Epistles. We need to come back to glean something of grace from Luke to Jude and from Peter&rsquo;s field and John&rsquo;s field.</p>
<p>The truth concerning grace is very important. Grace is covered by many writers in many different ways. Luke refers to grace at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s conceiving in Mary. In Luke 1:28 the angel Gabriel said to Mary, &ldquo;Rejoice, you who have been graced! The Lord is with you.&rdquo; In verse 30 he said, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor [grace] with God.&rdquo; Most translations use the word <em>favor</em> instead of <em>grace,</em> but the word in the Greek text is the same word used for <em>grace.</em> In our Recovery Version, we translated verse 28 properly. Mary was graced by the Lord. But in verse 30 we translated <em>grace</em> as &ldquo;favor.&rdquo; Note 30<sup>1</sup> says, &ldquo;Or, grace.&rdquo; In our revised version we will translate this as &ldquo;grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s conceiving of the Lord Jesus was great because that was God&rsquo;s incarnation within her. This was not just Mary&rsquo;s finding favor or being favored by God. This was a matter of grace. Whatever is mentioned as the first case in the Bible becomes the principle, and the first case in the New Testament of grace is the case of God&rsquo;s incarnation. At one time God was in an unapproachable place (1 Tim. 6:16). In the Old Testament, He came out to visit people, but never in His visitation did He stay with the one who was visited by Him. He came to Abraham and feasted with him, but then He left. He came to Gideon and left. He came to a number of persons in the Old Testament, but His coming was merely a temporary visit.</p>
<p>His incarnation was different from this. His incarnation was not just His coming to visit Mary. Instead, He came to stay in Mary, to stay in her physical womb. Matthew 1:20 says that what was begotten in Mary was of the Holy Spirit. God came to visit Mary, and He entered into her and stayed in her to be the very essence of her conceiving of a wonderful Person, who would be both God and man, a God-man. The incarnation was a great thing. God came to visit people, to enter into people, and to stay in people. This is grace. Mary was graced by God and found grace with God.</p>
<p>Grace is God&rsquo;s visitation to stay in man, to be born in man, and to be one with man. We should not forget that Mary&rsquo;s being graced by God in the conception of the Man-Savior is the first mention of the word <em>grace</em> in the New Testament, so this establishes a principle. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.&rdquo; The Lord came to stay in us, to be born in us, to be one with us, and even to become us. This is grace. We must keep this definition of grace in mind. Then with this definition we can interpret every verse where grace is mentioned in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Luke 2 says that the young boy Jesus advanced in grace and in wisdom and in stature (v. 52). Jesus, as a young boy, advanced in grace with God. What does this mean? We have to say again that grace is God&rsquo;s visitation to stay in man, to be born in man, and to be one with man. No doubt, Jesus was a boy who behaved perfectly, but that was not all. He also advanced in grace with God. That means that God was growing in Him.</p><h2 class="head1">V. GLEANINGS IN THE VAST FIELD OF GOD&rsquo;S GRACE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Grace Which Was the Initiation of God&rsquo;s<br />
Grace in the New Testament by the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s<br />
Visit to Mary for the Conceiving of Christ</h2>
<p>The grace which Mary found and with which God graced her was the initiation of God&rsquo;s grace in the New Testament (Luke 1:28, 30). We must study this point by fellowshipping deeply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Grace in Which the Lord Jesus<br />
Grew in His Humanity as the Preparation<br />
for Him to Minister the Grace of God<br />
in His Ministry as the Savior of Man</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus grew in grace (Luke 2:40). That means that He grew in God as grace. As the Savior of man, in His ministry, He ministered God as grace to people, so He Himself as a young man grew in grace, in God. We may wonder what growing in God means. We need to see that God Himself is a constitution. He is constituted with many attributes. God is love, light, holiness, righteousness, etc. He is myriads of wonderful items. Every item of what God is, is an attribute of God. Our God is constituted in Himself with many attributes. When we grow in God, we grow in God&rsquo;s attributes.</p>
<p>The little boy Jesus did not have that much of the attributes of God, so He grew in grace. Grace is God Himself, and God is constituted with many attributes. Thus, as Jesus grew up, He became the constitution of God&rsquo;s attributes. Our human language is inadequate to fully explain this. To grow in God simply means to be constituted with all the attributes of God, the attributes with which God Himself is constituted.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we did not have a bit of God. But since we believed into Christ and received God into us, some divine attributes of God have been constituted into our being. Now, as seeking Christians, we are growing in God all the time. We are growing in His attributes. We are growing in His constitution. God&rsquo;s attributes, God&rsquo;s constitution, become grace. Grace is God&rsquo;s visitation, and God is a constitution of His divine attributes. When the young boy Jesus was growing in grace, that was His preparation to come out to minister God, with whom He was constituted, as the Savior of man. That young boy could be full of love, full of light, and full of all the attributes of God because He was growing up in these attributes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Grace in Which Jesus as a Young Boy<br />
Advanced with God and Men While He Was<br />
Also Advancing in Wisdom and Stature</h2>
<p>The young boy, Jesus, grew in three things: in wisdom, in stature, and in grace (Luke 2:52). In today&rsquo;s schools and in the homes, young ones are educated to grow in wisdom. But with Jesus, something was different. Jesus was advanced first in grace. His God was added to Him. Luke says that He advanced in grace and in wisdom and in stature. A person may grow to a large stature and yet not have grown in wisdom, because he did not gain the proper education. Others may grow in both wisdom and bodily stature, but they do not have God. We are here growing in God. We do not focus on growing in wisdom and stature. We may be great in wisdom and stature and also be short of God. A proper man should grow in three things&mdash;first, in God; second, in wisdom; and third, in bodily stature. To grow in grace is to grow in the increase of God. Grace is God&rsquo;s visitation to us to stay in us and make Himself one with us. We are growing in this grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. The Grace That Proceeded out of the Mouth<br />
of the Lord Jesus as the God-sent<br />
Prophet to Men to Meet Their Need</h2>
<p>Luke 4:22 says that &ldquo;all bore witness to Him and marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth.&rdquo; Man needs God. Jesus is a Man fully equipped, saturated, and constituted with God. He is the practical God, God Himself. When He comes to you, God comes. When He opens up His mouth, grace comes out of His mouth. That means God comes out.</p>
<p>Paul said that his second visit to the Corinthians would be a second grace to them (2 Cor. 1:15). This is because Paul was constituted with grace. As Saul of Tarsus, he had merely a great mentality, but after his salvation he was transformed. His name was changed to Paul, which means &ldquo;little.&rdquo; Although he was little, he had the biggest portion of God. When Paul came to people, grace came. When he taught people, he ministered grace to them.</p>
<p>I was with Brother Watchman Nee for eighteen years. We came together often. Every time I met with him, he ministered God as grace to me. One afternoon I went to visit him, and he asked me, &ldquo;Witness, what is patience?&rdquo; This question troubled me because I knew he did not want a simple answer. Eventually, he told me that patience is nothing but Christ. In this contact with him, I gained a big portion of God. He ministered God to me.</p>
<p>In order to be vital, we must be persons who are full of God, with the addition, advance, and growth of God. If a young girl is growing with God, she might tell her grandfather, &ldquo;Grandpa, I love the Lord, so I love you.&rdquo; In saying this to her grandfather, she ministers God to him. If many of us go to preach the gospel today, we will have more of God to minister to others than we did two years ago. To be vital is to be full of God. In order to be full of God, we must have the advance in God, the growth in God, the continuous addition of God. Thus, we can be God-sent prophets. When we go out, we must have the assurance that we are God-sent prophets.</p>
<p>When I promoted going to visit people by knocking on their doors in 1984, some said that this did not work. They said that they went out for three weeks, but did not gain anyone. We need to realize that we must be prepared to go out for three years to gain people, not just three weeks. Perhaps you would go to visit someone, and he would be very cold toward you. If you would go to him repeatedly, despite being turned away by him, he would eventually think, &ldquo;There must be something with this man. Why does he come to me again and again?&rdquo; After the fifth time you visit him, he may eventually say, &ldquo;Please come in.&rdquo; Then he would ask, &ldquo;Why do you come to me month after month? Who hired you? What&rsquo;s your job? Why do you do this?&rdquo; Perhaps at this point, your tears would come down and you would say, &ldquo;I come because Jesus loves me, and Jesus loves you. I want to let you know that Jesus loves you.&rdquo; This may cause him to shed tears also and he will be saved. This is what it means to be vital. Who can withstand our repeated visitation to them with God as grace? Eventually, people will be subdued by this. If we go out again and again to visit people by knocking on their doors, eventually we will gain some.</p><h2 class="head2">5. The Grace Which Is the Expression of God&rsquo;s<br />
Attributes in Human Virtues in the Living<br />
of the Early Believers in Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Acts 2:47 describes a situation in which the early believers in Jerusalem were contacting God and experiencing God. Everyone was full of God. That was a situation of grace which could be seen by others. That grace was the visitation of God. A group of believers were growing to express God&rsquo;s attributes in their virtues. They were humble, loving, and full of light. All these were human virtues, but these virtues were the expression of God&rsquo;s attributes. That was the issue of their experience of God as grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Grace Which Was upon the Multitude<br />
of Believers When the Apostles Gave Them<br />
Testimony of the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>When the apostles gave the believers testimony concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, great grace was upon them (Acts 4:33). When we are under the proper ministry of the word, grace is also upon us. There is an atmosphere and situation of God&rsquo;s presence with us. The presence of God is the grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Grace of Which Stephen Was Full,<br />
and the Power of Which He Was Full, When He<br />
Did Great Wonders and Signs among the People</h2>
<p>When Stephen was full of grace and full of power, he did great wonders and signs among the people (Acts 6:8). In Pentecostalism many of the so-called miracles and healings are false. But what Stephen did was the genuine manifestation of grace. That was God&rsquo;s visitation. God was there.</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. The Grace Enjoyed by the Believers<br />
in Antioch, Which Barnabas Saw</h2>
<p>When Barnabas went to Antioch, he saw God&rsquo;s grace which the believers there enjoyed (Acts 11:23). That means that they were all continually enjoying God&rsquo;s visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. The Grace in Which the New<br />
Believers Were Urged to Continue by<br />
the Apostles Paul and Barnabas</h2>
<p>The apostles Paul and Barnabas urged the new believers to continue in the grace (Acts 13:43). That means to continue in advancing and growing in grace, which is the visitation of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. The Grace of Which the Word of God Is,<br />
Ministered to the New Believers<br />
by Paul and Barnabas</h2>
<p>The word of God is called the word of grace. This word of grace was ministered to the new believers by Paul and Barnabas (Acts 14:3). The word of grace is the word of God Himself, the word of God&rsquo;s visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">11. The Grace of God to Which Paul<br />
and Barnabas Had Been Commended<br />
for the Work Which They Fulfilled</h2>
<p>When Paul and Barnabas were going out, the saints commended them to the grace of God (Acts 14:26). That means when they went out, they would always be under God&rsquo;s visitation, God&rsquo;s grace. The saints commended them to God&rsquo;s visitation.</p><h2 class="head2">12. The Grace of the Lord Jesus through Which<br />
Peter and the Jewish Believers Were Saved<br />
in the Same Way as the Gentile Believers Were</h2>
<p>There was a grace through which Peter and the Jewish believers were saved. Then they saw that the Gentiles were saved in the same way (Acts 15:11). This way was God&rsquo;s presence, God&rsquo;s grace, God&rsquo;s visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">13. The Grace of the Lord to Which Paul and<br />
Silas Were Commended by the Brothers</h2>
<p>Acts 15:40 says, &ldquo;But Paul chose Silas and went out, having been commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers.&rdquo; This time we see that Paul and Silas were commended to the Lord&rsquo;s grace by the brothers. This was the start of Paul&rsquo;s second ministry journey.</p>
<h2 class="head2">14. The Grace through Which Apollos<br />
Helped the Believers in the Region of Achaia</h2>
<p>Apollos brought and ministered God as grace in every place he went in Achaia (Acts 18:27).</p>
<h2 class="head2">15. The Grace of Which Is the Gospel Solemnly<br />
Testified by the Apostle Paul in His Ministry</h2>
<p>Paul, in his ministry, always ministered God as grace. He solemnly testified of the gospel of the grace of God to minister God into people (Acts 20:24).</p>
<h2 class="head2">16. The Grace of Which the Word Is, to Which<br />
the Apostle Paul Committed the Ephesian Elders</h2>
<p>Paul the apostle committed the Ephesian elders to the word of God&rsquo;s grace (Acts 20:32). This grace is God&rsquo;s visitation, God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<h2 class="head2">17. The Grace Which Is Greater, Given by God<br />
to the Humble as It Was Prophesied<br />
in the Old Testament That God Resists<br />
the Proud but Gives Grace to the Humble</h2>
<p>James 4:6 says, &ldquo;But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, &lsquo;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&rsquo;&rdquo; If we are humble, God will come to us, and we will experience His visitation. This is grace. God rejects the proud. That means God will not visit them. But God will come to the humble all day. When we are humble, God is with us, and this presence of God is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">18. The Grace with Mercy and Peace,<br />
Which Is with the Believers from<br />
God the Father and from Jesus Christ,<br />
the Son of the Father, in Truth and Love</h2>
<p>Second John 3 says, &ldquo;Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.&rdquo; When we live in truth and in love, that is a sign that God is with us, and that is the grace. Grace is actually God Himself visiting people. When we live in truth and love, God comes to visit us, and that is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">19. The Grace Which Was Perverted into<br />
Licentiousness by Ungodly Men, Who Denied<br />
the Only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Jude 4 says that ungodly men perverted the grace of our God into licentiousness and denied our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. The ungodly men perverted God&rsquo;s presence in such a sinful way and denied the headship and lordship of Christ.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

</ol>
<p>In this message we want to see the gleanings of grace from Peter&rsquo;s writings and John&rsquo;s writings. The New Testament was written mainly by three apostles. I do not say <em>only</em> but <em>mainly</em> by three apostles: John, Paul, and Peter. According to the New Testament record, the earlier speakers were Peter and John. The later speaker was Paul. In Acts there are these three main speakers. Apollos and Barnabas also taught, but there is no record of their messages.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles are the center and the frame of grace, but we need Peter and John to complete the truth concerning grace. In Paul&rsquo;s writings there are the center and the frame but not the beginning and the ending of grace. The beginning and ending of grace are covered by John. Peter&rsquo;s writings cover a number of points which were not covered by Paul, and these are also very important.</p><h2 class="head2">20. The Grace That Was to Come<br />
unto the Believers</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:10 speaks of the grace that was to come unto the believers, which was prophesied by the prophets, who sought and searched diligently concerning the salvation of the believers&rsquo; souls. The grace mentioned by Peter here is different from the grace mentioned in John 1. John said that the Word became flesh, full of grace, and that grace came through Jesus Christ (vv. 14, 17). Grace came through Jesus Christ, with Jesus&rsquo; incarnation, but Peter said that there is a grace which is not yet but is to come. This grace was not mentioned in the Old Testament, but it was prophesied by the prophets who sought and searched diligently concerning the salvation of the believers&rsquo; souls (1 Pet. 1:9), not the salvation of their bodies or spirits. Our souls need to be saved.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s theological schools do not teach concerning the salvation of the soul. This shows the shortage in the theology of Christianity. In Christianity the top theology is that of the Brethren. This is the theology adopted by Dallas Theological Seminary and based on the teachings of C. I. Scofield. The Scofield Reference Bible was written according to the Brethren teaching. There are also the Reformed theology of John Calvin and other theologies, but all these theologies are short of the divine revelation. This shortage is also evident in the Nicene Creed, which is adhered to by both the Catholic Church and many of the Protestant churches. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day, many in Christianity still recite the Nicene Creed. It is perfect and we agree with it, but it is incomplete.</p>
<p>There are at least six crucial points which the Nicene Creed does not mention. 1) John 7:39 says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet.&rdquo; No theology in Christianity covers this point. They do not know what this means. 2) First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; In Christianity&rsquo;s traditional teaching of the Triune God, the three of the Triune God are separate. If you say that Christ, the Son in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit, they feel that you are mixing up the Son with the Spirit. Actually, their teaching of the Trinity is tritheistic. They do not admit that they believe in three Gods, but unconsciously they teach three Gods. To them the Son is one God, the Spirit is one God, and the Father is one God. Some have said that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45b is not the Holy Spirit. But if this were the case, there must be another Spirit besides the Holy Spirit which gives life. 3) Second Corinthians 3:17 says that &ldquo;the Lord is the Spirit,&rdquo; and verse 18 speaks of the &ldquo;Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord and the Spirit are one, but the traditional teaching says that the Son, who is the Lord, is separate from the Spirit. But in 2 Corinthians 3:18 there is the compound divine title <em>the Lord Spirit.</em> 4) Philippians 1:19 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. 5) Revelation 1:4; 4:5; and 5:6 speak of the seven Spirits. 6) Exodus 30 reveals the compound Spirit typified by the holy anointing ointment (vv. 23-25). This ointment is compounded with olive oil and four spices. Who knows the significance of these five elements?</p>
<p>The above six points are not taught or understood in today&rsquo;s Christianity, so the Nicene Creed is perfect but incomplete. I am saying this here because when we speak on the crystallization of the grace of God, we are also exposing the shortage of today&rsquo;s theology.</p>
<p>Peter spoke of the grace which was for the salvation of the believers&rsquo; souls. What Peter teaches as grace is not the grace that saves our spirit or our body, but the grace that saves our soul. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul-life?&rdquo; (Mark 8:36). A man can gain the whole world and lose his soul. This shows that the soul needs to be saved. If, for the sake of saving your soul, you sacrifice the whole world, that is worthwhile.</p>
<h2 class="head2">21. The Grace on Which the Believers Set<br />
Their Hope Perfectly and Which Will Be Brought<br />
to the Believers at the Revelation of Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:13 speaks of the grace on which the believers set their hope perfectly. Nearly every day, I pray that my soul will be saved at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. In Matthew 25 the Lord speaks of different types of servants. When the Lord comes back, He will tell some that they are slothful slaves, and they will be cast into the outer darkness (vv. 24-30). This is to lose the soul. The Lord will tell others that they are good and faithful slaves, and they will enter into the joy of their Lord (vv. 20-23). This is the saving of the soul in the next age for those who enter into the enjoyment of the Lord to feast with Him. This grace will come by the revelation of the Lord Jesus at His second coming. It was studied by the prophets in the Old Testament and is hoped for by us, the New Testament believers. Thank the Lord for such a grace.</p><h2 class="head2">22. The Grace with God Which Is<br />
the Believers&rsquo; Bearing Sorrows by Suffering<br />
Unrighteously and the Believers&rsquo; Enduring<br />
While Doing Good and Suffering</h2>
<p>According to 1 Peter 2:19-20, if you suffer unrighteous persecution as a believer or if you endure suffering while you are doing good, what you do is grace with God. <em>With God</em> means before God, in the eyes of God. Note 1 of 1 Peter 2:19 says, &ldquo;Grace here refers to the motivation of the divine life within us and its expression in our living, which becomes in our behavior gracious and acceptable in the eyes of both man and God (v. 20).&rdquo; When we suffer persecution while we are doing good, this is grace with God, because this is something motivated by the divine life within us and expressed in our living. Such a condition is gracious and acceptable before God and man. It is sweet and beautiful in the eyes of God because it is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">23. The Grace Which God Gives to the Humble<br />
While He Resists the Proud</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:5 says, &ldquo;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&rdquo; We must learn to be humble and not proud. If we are proud, God rejects us. If we are humble, God will give us grace. This grace is not a new car or any material thing, but God Himself. If we are humble, God will give Himself as grace to us. If we are proud, He will resist us. Grace is free. Anything that is given at a cost is not grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">24. The Grace in Which, Together with the<br />
Knowledge of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,<br />
the Believers Should Grow unto His Glory Both<br />
Now and unto the Day of Eternity</h2>
<p>Second Peter 3:18 says that we need to grow in grace. Grace is God Himself with divinity processed through incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension. All these elements of grace are within us to be one with us. Grace is God Himself as our life to be one with us, to save us, to make His home in us, and to be formed in us. We need to grow in such a grace for His glory today and unto the day of eternity. Second Peter 3:18 is the concluding word of the apostle Peter&rsquo;s writings, indicating that whatever he has written is of, in, by, and through the grace of God. This finishes the gleaning of the field of God&rsquo;s grace in Peter&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">25. The Grace Which We the Believers<br />
Have Received in the New Testament<br />
Being Rich unto Its Fullness</h2>
<p>Now we come to the gleanings in John&rsquo;s writings. In the Gospel of John there is one verse which is very critical. That is John 1:16: &ldquo;For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we receive grace upon grace. When I was young, I heard someone say that the grace of God upon us is like the waves of the ocean. Grace upon grace is like wave upon wave. Gradually, however, I realized that grace upon grace is the fullness of the riches of grace.</p>
<p>We need to see the difference between the riches and the fullness. The fullness is the overflowing, the expression, of the riches. If a cup contains much water, it has the riches of water. But these riches cannot be seen until the cup is overflowing with water. The overflowing is the fullness of the riches. God&rsquo;s grace is not only rich but rich to overflowing. That is the fullness, the expression of the riches. Grace came with Christ, and this grace is not only rich but also overflows.</p>
<p>We may be rich and yet not have the fullness. The grace in the New Testament began with the incarnation of Christ, and that grace has the fullness. It is rich to the extent that it overflows. The grace which we the believers have received in the New Testament is rich unto its fullness, which is the expression of the overflowing riches which we have received in Christ through the Spirit for the accomplishment of God the Father&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is His eternal economy. God&rsquo;s eternal economy is accomplished according to His New Testament economy by grace.</p><h2 class="head2">26. The Grace Which Is Given to<br />
the Local Churches in the Dark Age<br />
of the Church&rsquo;s Degradation</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:4 speaks of the grace which is given to the local churches in the dark age of the church&rsquo;s degradation for the believers who seek to answer the Lord&rsquo;s calling to be His overcomers over the self (Matt. 16:24), the devil (Heb. 2:14), sin (Rom. 5:21a), the cosmos of Satan (John 12:31), satanic Judaism (Rev. 3:9), demonic Catholicism (Rev. 2:20, 24), and Christless Protestantism (Rev. 3:1b, 20) for the closing of all the ages and for the bringing in of the New Jerusalem. This indicates that grace reigns unto eternal life (Rom. 5:21b). Because sin reigns, we also must reign by grace. To reign by grace is to overcome.</p>
<p>We need to overcome today&rsquo;s Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism by the grace of Christ. The Protestant churches are Christless, because Revelation tells us that Christ is outside the door of the Protestant churches. In Laodicea Christ was knocking on the door (Rev. 3:20). Because Christ was outside the so-called church, it does not have Christ. It is Christless.</p>
<p>We have to overcome all these negative things for the closing of all the ages and for the bringing in of the New Jerusalem. Grace reigns over all the enemies to bring in the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the fulfillment of the word in Romans 5:21 that grace reigns unto eternal life. It will be a strong testimony of the consummation of the divine life carried out by grace. Grace reigning unto eternal life means that grace reigns to bring in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Revelation 1:4 and 5 say, &ldquo;Grace to you...from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.&rdquo; The beginning of the book of Revelation indicates that grace will come to us for all the things covered in the following chapters. How can we have the lampstands? By grace. How can we overcome the degradation of the church? By grace. How can we suffer the persecution and opposition from Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism? By grace. How can we be the overcomers? By grace. How can we fight down Satan? By grace. How can we fight down our self? By grace. In every chapter of the book of Revelation, whatever is done positively is all by grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">27. The Grace of the Lord Jesus Dispensed to<br />
His Believers throughout the New Testament Age<br />
Consummating in the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The grace is with us at the beginning of the book of Revelation, and this same grace is mentioned at the end of this book. Thus, grace is not only the end of the book of Revelation but also the end of the entire Bible. Revelation 22:21 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.&rdquo; The saints include all of us who have believed into Christ. This is the closing, the ending, of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>Many Bible readers know and can recite the first sentence of the Bible: &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (ASV). But not many know the concluding word of the Bible. <em>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth</em> is objective to us. But <em>the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints</em> is subjective to us. We have to pray-read this concluding verse of the Bible. The grace of the Lord must be with each one of us in every aspect of our daily life because we are saints. This grace consummates in the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s good pleasure in joining and mingling Himself with man for His glorious enlargement and eternal expression.</p><h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>The New Testament is a history of the grace of God as the incarnation of the Triune God in His Trinity processed and consummated. We need to realize that Christ changed in His form twice. Christ was originally just God. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God.&rdquo; Then verse 14 says that this Word became flesh. As God He was changed in form to become a man in the flesh. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The last Adam was Christ in the flesh. Christ was God, and then He became flesh to be the last Adam, and this last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The first change in form was the incarnation. The second change in form was His becoming the Spirit.</p>
<p>Christ has two ministries: the earthly ministry and the heavenly ministry. Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry was carried out by Him in His flesh to the point of His resurrection. From His incarnation to His resurrection was thirty-three and a half years. That was the work Christ did in His flesh to be with His disciples, to be among them. At the end of His earthly ministry, He told the disciples He could only be among them and with them until the day when the Spirit of reality would come. He said, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; In the flesh He was with the disciples, but He could not be in them. He needed to become the Spirit to be in them (cf. John 14:16-20).</p>
<p>In His earthly ministry in the flesh, only half of His work was completed. He needed to finish the second half of His work by becoming the life-giving Spirit. Paul mentioned repeatedly in his writings that Christ is in us. Galatians 2:20 says that we have been crucified with Christ and that it is no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us. Paul also said that Christ is being formed in us (4:19) and making His home in us (Eph. 3:17). This is Christ not only in the Spirit but also as the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit is the totality, the aggregate, of the Triune God. He is the consummation of the Triune God. The consummation of the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic form of Christ, so the life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ. The pneumatic Christ is the Spirit who is Christ. In Romans 8:9-11 the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Himself, and the indwelling Spirit are interchangeably used. These are not four persons but one person. The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself, and Christ Himself is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us to impart the Triune God into our being.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s theology in Christianity is far short of this divine revelation. We are fighting a battle. Pray for us. My burden to live on this earth is on the one hand, to put out the crystallization-study of the critical words of the New Testament. On the other hand, it is to expose the shortages of the theology in Christianity.</p>
<p>The New Testament is a history of God&rsquo;s grace, and grace is the incarnated Triune God. In the first step the Triune God became a man in the flesh through His birth by a human virgin as grace coming to be among men for the accomplishment of redemption. In the second step the last Adam, as the embodiment of the Triune God, became the life-giving Spirit through His death and resurrection as grace entering into man for the impartation of the processed and consummated Triune God into the believers, to be the source, element, and essence of the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the glorious enlargement and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in eternity.</p>
<p>Grace is the incarnated Triune God. John 1:17 says that grace came and the law was given. The law cannot come, but grace can come because it is a living Person. Romans 5 even says that grace reigns (v. 21). Actually, in the entire universe, God is the One who reigns. This shows that grace is the incarnated Triune God. In the incarnation of Christ, grace came. That was the initiation of grace into the New Testament age coming to be among men for the accomplishment of redemption. Christ accomplished redemption starting from His incarnation to His resurrection. He did all this, not in the Spirit but in His flesh. The New Testament does say that Christ died in His flesh, but no verse says that Christ died in His Spirit. Christ has two ages. The first age is the age of His life in the flesh from His incarnation to His resurrection. The second age is the age of His being the Spirit from resurrection to eternity. Within this Spirit there is the element of Christ&rsquo;s uplifted and designated humanity.</p>
<p>In the second step the last Adam, as the embodiment of the Triune God, became the life-giving Spirit through His death and resurrection. This is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45b. This is Christ as grace entering into man. Christ came in the flesh, but at that time there was no possibility for Him to enter into His disciples. He could only be among them. Before His death and resurrection, He gave a long message to His disciples in John 14&mdash;16. In John 14 He told the disciples that He could be among them but that He had no way to enter into them in the flesh. They would have to wait for another Comforter, who is the Spirit of reality. John 14:16-20 unveils that this Spirit of reality is the realization of Christ, Christ Himself.</p>
<p>After giving this message to His disciples, He was arrested, judged, and then sentenced to death and crucified. That was the end of Christ&rsquo;s life in the flesh. After a short time, He resurrected with His body. He left the fine linen which wrapped His body, but He did not leave His body of flesh in the tomb. His body was transformed into a spiritual body. So 1 Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam changed to become a life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit today is Christ Himself, the pneumatic Christ.</p>
<p>Christianity has never made it clear that Christ has two ministries: the earthly ministry and the heavenly ministry. The earthly ministry was carried out by Christ in His flesh mainly that He might die for us for the accomplishment of redemption. He is now carrying out His heavenly ministry as the life-giving Spirit to impart God into us as life for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>The New Testament teaches God&rsquo;s eternal economy which is the New Testament economy. The entire twenty-seven books of the New Testament, from the first chapter of Matthew to the last chapter of Revelation, are the New Testament revelation. This revelation is the apostles&rsquo; teaching, which is mainly of three apostles: John, who wrote the Gospel of John, the three Epistles of John, and Revelation; Paul, who wrote fourteen Epistles; and Peter, who wrote two Epistles. Their teaching is called the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>The New Testament economy, the New Testament revelation, which is the apostles&rsquo; teaching, implies some main things. The first main thing is the incarnation of God to be a man. Matthew 1 tells us this. Then this incarnated God lived on earth among men for thirty-three and a half years. The four Gospels record this human living. Then He passed through death, resurrection, and ascension. All these five points&mdash;incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension&mdash;produce the church. There is an issue that comes out of God&rsquo;s incarnation, human life, death, resurrection, and ascension. Thus, on the day of Pentecost the church was produced, and the church is the Body of Christ. This Body of Christ is the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ. The church, the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride are one thing, an aggregate, which consummates in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When we speak of the gospel, we mean the New Testament economy. This New Testament economy implies Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and the issue of these five steps, which is the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and Christ&rsquo;s bride, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. This is the New Testament economy, which is the New Testament revelation and the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

</ol>
<p>In this message we come to another point of the crystallization-study. This point is the announcing of the gospel. According to the Greek text, we prefer to use <em>announcing</em> instead of <em>preaching.</em> It is not just a matter of preaching but a matter of announcing. The announcing of the gospel is not a simple thing; it is not a small matter.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE APOSTLE PAUL&rsquo;S PERFECT EXAMPLE AND<br />
HIGH STANDARD IN ANNOUNCING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The New Testament revelation concerning the announcing of the gospel gives us a very high standard and a perfect example in the apostle Paul.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Chosen to Be a Vessel</h2>
<p>First, this announcer was chosen by God to be a vessel&mdash;not a carrier but a vessel to contain Christ (Acts 9:15). When you go out to contact people with the intention of announcing the gospel, you must realize that you are a vessel. Christ cannot be carried by you as something outward. Christ must be contained within you as your contents. Then you, the vessel, become one with the contents. When you go to contact people, that is Christ going. You are His vessel to convey Him to people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Appointed to Be a Minister<br />
and a Witness of Christ</h2>
<p>Paul was appointed to be a minister and a witness of Christ (Acts 26:16). A minister is one who serves others. If you are going to announce the gospel, you must be a servant to serve others with Christ. A waiter in a restaurant is a minister. He ministers the food of the restaurant. As a rule, every waiter must also be a witness of the food. If a waiter can tell a customer that he has tasted a certain dish and that it is very nourishing and delicious, the customer will want it. We need to serve people with the Christ whom we have tasted. Then we become His witnesses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Given to Be a Steward of the Grace of God</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3:2 Paul said he had the stewardship of the grace of God. A steward is different from a waiter. According to the ancient custom, a steward was a general servant who directed everything. A steward of a rich man knew everything concerning the rich man&rsquo;s house. God made Paul a steward of the grace of God. Here the grace equals the gospel. The gospel <em>is</em> the grace. Paul was made a steward to take care of God&rsquo;s grace, God&rsquo;s gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Separated unto the Gospel of God</h2>
<p>Romans 1:1 says that Paul was separated unto the gospel of God. Galatians 1:15 and 16 say that he was set apart by God for the gospel from the womb of his mother, before he was born. When he grew up, he became a strong Judaizer, persecuting Christ and devastating the churches. One day while he was going to Damascus to arrest the callers of Jesus, he fell to the ground. He heard a voice saying to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads&rdquo; (Acts 26:14). A goad on a plow is a sharp pointed stick used to subdue and prod an ox yoked to the plow. The Lord&rsquo;s word here signifies that Saul was already yoked to the plow and had no choice but to take the Lord&rsquo;s yoke obediently for the carrying out of the Lord&rsquo;s commission. It was as if the Lord was saying to Paul, &ldquo;You think you are free. Actually, you are yoked to My plow. I have set you apart already from your mother&rsquo;s womb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not think that many of us have ever considered that God has set us apart from our mother&rsquo;s womb. We all need to realize that we were set apart from our mother&rsquo;s womb to announce Christ as the gospel. I was like Paul on the road to Damascus. When I was nineteen years old, I was endeavoring to advance myself by getting the proper education. One afternoon I heard the gospel, and I was caught by the Lord. I gave up my expectation to get a high education. I told the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, from today I want to be a poor preacher, carrying the Bible to travel through the villages and announce Christ. I am willing to eat the root of the trees and to drink the water from the hills.&rdquo; To announce the gospel is not a light thing, but something very special.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Commissioned as a Herald</h2>
<p>Paul said that he was commissioned as a herald (1 Tim. 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11). A herald is an official reporter. Paul was such an official reporter of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Sent by God, the Highest<br />
Authority, as His Ambassador</h2>
<p>God is the highest authority in the universe; God sent Paul as His ambassador to the sinners to speak in boldness the mystery of the gospel (Eph. 6:19-20). An ambassador always represents a higher authority to contact and deal with others. God sent Paul as His ambassador to deal with the sinners, to speak in boldness the mystery of the gospel. If someone rejects you when you are announcing the gospel, you may say, &ldquo;Sir, I am an ambassador of God sent by Him to <em>you</em>. You should not reject me.&rdquo; We can be bold because we are God&rsquo;s ambassadors.</p>
<p>We must speak in boldness the mystery of the gospel. The gospel actually is the good news of God&rsquo;s economy. In God&rsquo;s economy there are five big mysteries: 1) the Triune God; 2) the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ; 3) the consummated, compounded, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, and sevenfold intensified Spirit; 4) the Body of Christ; 5) the New Jerusalem. We should even have the boldness to preach the gospel by telling people about the New Jerusalem. We need to be able to speak with boldness concerning the highest peak of God&rsquo;s revelation, telling people that God became a man in order that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. This kind of preaching does work. We should not be afraid and timid when we go out to announce the gospel. This will cause people to reject us. We must go out as God&rsquo;s ambassadors.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Laboring as a Priest of the Gospel</h2>
<p>In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a laboring priest of the gospel to offer the Gentiles to God. The Old Testament priests offered the sacrifices which typified Christ. But today we, the New Testament priests, offer to God the saved sinners who have been converted into Christ&rsquo;s members. We are not announcing the gospel for soul-winning. That is too low. Instead, we want to convert sinners into members of Christ and offer them to God as sacrifices. This is the work of a laboring priest of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. To Announce</h2>
<p>We must announce the contents of God&rsquo;s economy. This means that we announce God&rsquo;s incarnation to be a man, His living on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, and His going to the cross to die an all-inclusive death. On the negative side, He terminated everything of the old creation. He also terminated Satan, sin, the world, and the flesh. On the positive side, through His death, He released the divine life within Him into His believers to germinate them with the divine life. Then through resurrection and in ascension, He poured out the Spirit, and the church came into being. The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is the house of God, the kingdom of God, and Christ&rsquo;s bride. This will consummate in the New Jerusalem. We need to speak these marvelous things. We should not be very concerned about whether or not others fully understand this. Sometimes they understand much and they will still not believe. Sometimes they do not understand much, but they want to believe. We must change our way. Do not take the old way. Take the new way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ as the Objective Savior and<br />
the Subjective Indwelling Life-imparter</h2>
<p>We must announce Christ as the objective Savior and the subjective indwelling Life-imparter. First Timothy 1:15 says that the faithful word is that Christ came into the world to save sinners. This is Christ as the objective Savior of the sinners. Then Paul tells us in Galatians 1:15-16 that God was happy to reveal Christ in him that he might preach Him to others. This is not the outward Savior but the inward, indwelling, Life-imparter. Paul announced Christ as the indwelling One to others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Unsearchable Riches of Christ as the Gospel</h2>
<p>The gospel preached today by Christianity is altogether too shallow, simple, and poor. Paul announced the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3:4 Paul spoke of the mystery of Christ. We have to learn all these deeper, higher things to speak to others. This is the higher gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Mystery of the Gospel</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 6:19 Paul said, &ldquo;And for me, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel.&rdquo; The mystery of the gospel is Christ and the church for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose (Eph. 5:32).</p><h2 class="head2">I. To Beget the Believers through the Gospel</h2>
<p>Paul told the Corinthians that he begot them through the gospel (1 Cor. 4:15). This is not to win souls but to beget children.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. For the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>We go to beget people, to regenerate people, not that they may go to heaven but that they may be the material to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. Burdened</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. To Bear Fruit among All the Gentiles</h2>
<p>The name <em>Paul</em> means &ldquo;little.&rdquo; He was a little man, but he had a big heart. He wanted to bear fruit among all the Gentiles (Rom. 1:13). Because we are so narrow, we may be happy with getting one person saved a year. It is better if we aspire to gain ten yearly, in following Paul&rsquo;s example. If there is a will, there is a way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. To Pay His Debt of the Gospel<br />
as a Debtor to All Kinds of People</h2>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish&rdquo; (Rom. 1:14). Paul owed people the gospel. To announce the gospel to them was to pay off his debt.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. To Announce the Gospel to the Romans</h2>
<p>In announcing the gospel to the Romans, Paul said that he was not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes (Rom. 1:15-16).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. To Stress the Beauty of the One Who Announces<br />
the Gospel as the News of Good Things</h2>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;How beautiful are the feet of those who announce the news of good things&rdquo; (Rom. 10:14-15). When you go out to announce the gospel, you must have the realization that your feet are beautiful. If you were going to the theater, you would say, &ldquo;How ugly are my feet.&rdquo; But when you go to visit people, you say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, how beautiful are my feet!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. To Enslave Himself to All That He Might Gain<br />
the More and to Become All Things to All Men<br />
That He Might by All Means Save Some</h2>
<p>Paul was free. He was not a slave to anyone, but he enslaved himself to all men that he might gain the more. He became all things to all men. To the Gentiles, he became a Gentile; to the Jews, he became a Jew; to the people under the law, he became one under the law; to the people without the law, he became a person without the law. This was so that he might by all means save some, doing all things for the sake of the gospel; otherwise, it would be a woe to him (1 Cor. 9:16-23). Paul said, &ldquo;Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel&rdquo; (v. 16). This is because he was entrusted with a stewardship which would bring him a reward as an incentive.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. To Charge His Young Co-worker Timothy<br />
to Proclaim the Word in Season and out of Season<br />
While He Was Ready to Receive His Martyrdom</h2>
<p>Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2). We often excuse ourselves by saying that it is not the right day or time to announce the gospel. But we need to be ready in season or out of season. That means we should proclaim the word whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient, whether we are welcome or unwelcome. Paul charged his co-worker to do this while he was ready to receive martyrdom (v. 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. To Have the Saints as His Partners<br />
in the Gospel, Striving for the Gospel</h2>
<p>The saints in Philippi were Paul&rsquo;s partners in the gospel, striving for the gospel (Phil. 1:5, 27). The Philippians joined Paul&rsquo;s move in the announcing of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. To Fully Preach the Gospel of Christ<br />
from Jerusalem and Round About to Illyricum</h2>
<p>Paul was burdened to fully preach the gospel of Christ from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum (Rom. 15:19; cf. 2 Cor. 10:15-16). Illyricum was a remote region located northwest of Macedonia. Paul, with his co-workers, started preaching from Jerusalem. This shows that Paul preached extensively. At his time, he nearly exhausted all the places where he could preach the gospel. If we compare Paul with ourselves, we can see that his standard is very high and his example is excellent and perfect in announcing the gospel. When we consider Paul&rsquo;s pattern, we have no excuse for not going to announce the gospel.</p><h1 class="series">CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD<br />

	<li>After the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s redemption for man through His death and resurrection, the Lord as the Man-Savior charged His disciples to proclaim repentance for forgiveness of sins in His name to all the nations that the fallen men may be redeemed back to the way of peace that leads them into the blessing prepared by God for them according to His eternal economy&mdash;Luke 24:46-48; 1:77-79; 2:30-32.</li>

	<li>After He had trained the disciples to know the kingdom of God, which, according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is different from the kingdom of Israel, and when He was ready to return to the heavens triumphantly in the presence of His disciples (Acts 1:2-9), the Lord as the Victor over Satan, sin, and death, the One who was to be made by God in the heavens both the Lord and Christ, charged His disciples to be His witnesses, especially of His resurrection and His ascension (2:32-36; 5:30-32), from Jerusalem unto the uttermost part of the earth, by the power of the Spirit (1:8), that is, to announce the gospel of the kingdom of God (8:12) for the establishment of the kingdom of God on the earth (1:3; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31; Rom. 14:17; Eph. 2:19; 5:5).</li>

	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>In the previous message, we saw that Paul gives us the perfect example and highest standard in the announcing of the gospel. In this message we first want to see the commission of the Lord as the Christ of God for the announcing of the gospel. In each of the four Gospels and Acts, the Lord commissioned His disciples to carry out the gospel. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke this commission is at the end, but in John it is in the middle. In chapter fifteen of John, the Lord charged the disciples to go forth and bear fruit (v. 16). Then at the beginning of Acts, the Lord trained the disciples, before His ascension, to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God (1:2-9).</p>
<p>In each particular book, the Lord&rsquo;s commission has a particular base. If we are to understand the Lord&rsquo;s commission in these five books, we have to enter into the intrinsic contents of each book. The book of Matthew is on the kingdom of the heavens. The first thing the New Testament offers to us is the kingdom of the heavens. Mark and Luke also have their particular perspectives on the gospel. John is very deep and high, and Acts is on the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>After we see the Lord&rsquo;s commission to us in Matthew through Acts, we want to go on to fellowship concerning Peter&rsquo;s reminding the believers to tell out the virtues of God (1 Pet. 2:9). This telling out is a kind of preaching, and the virtues of God are the contents of the gospel. Finally, we need to see the calling of the Spirit and the bride (Rev. 22:17). Together they call people to come to drink the living water.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE COMMISSION OF THE LORD<br />
AS THE CHRIST OF GOD</h2>
<p>Jesus is our Lord and He is the Christ of God, so He has the standing to commission us for His gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Gospel of Matthew</h2>
<p>After all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord as the King-Savior commissioned His disciples to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and teaching them to observe all that He had commanded them, to make them citizens of His kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 28:18-20). Christ is the King. All the authority in heaven and on earth, in the whole universe, has been given to God&rsquo;s Christ. This authority given to Christ is for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens. In Matthew the Lord is the King-Savior who commissioned His disciples to go and disciple the nations by baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. This is to bring the people out from the nations into the Triune God. The intrinsic purpose of our preaching the gospel is to bring people of the nations into the Triune God, to make them the citizens of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Many in Christianity say that to preach the gospel is for winning souls. But there is no mention of winning souls in the New Testament. The first book of the New Testament tells us that the preaching of the gospel is to bring people into God to make them the citizens of the kingdom of the heavens. This is very high and very deep. To preach the gospel is not to win souls, but to gain people from different countries and put them into the Triune God that they may become the citizens of the kingdom of the heavens for the establishment of this kingdom. When we go out to preach the gospel, we should not forget this purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In the Gospel of Mark</h2>
<p>In His resurrection the Lord as the Slave-Savior charged His disciples to go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation (of which mankind is the main item) to redeem and save God&rsquo;s lost creation from the vanity and slavery of corruption back to Him to enjoy the freedom of His glory (Mark 16:14-15; Rom. 8:20-21) in His new creation (Gal. 6:15b). In the Gospel of Mark, the Lord charged us to preach the gospel, not just to all men but to all the creation. Sometimes we have to preach the gospel to the birds, the horses, and the other living creatures. Mankind takes the lead of all the creation. Mark reveals that we preach the gospel to make people of the old creation the members of the new creation. In Matthew the preaching of the gospel is for setting up the kingdom of the heavens, but in Mark it is to bring a part of the old creation into the new creation. The creation was lost, so it needed to be redeemed, saved, back to God from the vanity and slavery of corruption. All the creation is under the vanity and the slavery of corruption and is waiting for a time when it can be redeemed and saved back to God to enjoy the freedom of God&rsquo;s glory in His new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In the Gospel of Luke</h2>
<p>In Matthew the Lord is the King-Savior. In Mark He is the Slave-Savior to serve people that they may be redeemed and saved back to God. In Luke He is the Man-Savior. After the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s redemption for man through His death and resurrection, the Lord as the Man-Savior charged His disciples to proclaim repentance for forgiveness of sins in His name to all the nations that the fallen men may be redeemed back to the way of peace that leads them into the blessing prepared by God for them according to His eternal economy (Luke 24:46-48; 1:77-79; 2:30-32). In Mark it is the fallen creation, but in Luke it is the fallen men who need to be redeemed back to the way of peace.</p>
<p>When God created man, God ordained blessing for man, but man fell from that original blessing. All the people on earth are seeking for blessing because they have lost the God-ordained blessing. Now a redeemed person should be redeemed back to the original blessing which God prepared. We need to consider what this original blessing is. First, man was ordained to express God (Gen. 1:26). To express God in His image is a great blessing. This blessing was also for man to have dominion over all things. The believers in Christ enjoy such a blessing. We are those who express God, have the dominion over all the creation, and one day will inherit the earth (Matt. 5:5; Heb. 2:5-8; Luke 19:17, 19).</p><h2 class="head2">D. In the Gospel of John</h2>
<p>After the unveiling of the mysterious mingling of the Divine Trinity with the believers (John 14:8-11, 16-20), the Lord as the God-Savior charged His disciples to bear fruit for His increase that His mystical Body, which is signified by the true vine composed of Him and His believers as His branches, may be completed as His fullness, His expression, as the New Jerusalem in eternity (John 15:16a; 3:30; 15:1-8; Rev. 21:1&mdash; 22:5).</p>
<p>In John 14 Christ unveiled the mysterious mingling of the Triune God with the believers. In this portion of the Word, the Lord Jesus told us that He came in the flesh to be with us, among us, but He was unable to get into us. Thus, He needed to be another Comforter, the Spirit of reality (vv. 16-20). The first Comforter was Jesus in the flesh, but the other Comforter would be the Spirit of reality. When the Spirit of reality would come on the day of resurrection, He would be not only with us but also in us. So the Lord said, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (v. 20). There are three <em>in</em> s. The Son is in the Father, we are in the Son, and the Son is in us. These three <em>in</em> s indicate a mingling. The believers are mingled with the Triune God.</p>
<p>After He unveiled this mingling, the Lord as the God-Savior charged us to bear fruit. In the four Gospels, the Lord is revealed as the King-Savior, the Slave-Savior, the Man-Savior, and the God-Savior respectively. In the Gospel of John, we see the mingling of the Triune God with the believers to produce the Body of Christ. We are the members of Christ just as we are the branches of the vine tree to bear fruit for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is Christ&rsquo;s increase. The Body of Christ will consummate in the New Jerusalem for God&rsquo;s eternal enlargement and expression. When we preach the gospel, we must remember that we are going to bear fruit for Christ&rsquo;s increase so that the Body of Christ can be completed and become the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. In the Book of Acts</h2>
<p>Acts 1 shows that the disciples were not clear about the difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Israel. Even though the Lord Jesus taught them about the kingdom of God while He was with them for three and a half years, at that time they did not fully understand it. So even after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, they asked the Lord if this was the time for Him to restore the kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6). The Lord revealed to them that the Father is going to establish His kingdom, the kingdom of God (v. 3).</p>
<p>After the Lord trained the disciples to know the kingdom of God, which, according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is different from the kingdom of Israel, and when He was ready to return to the heavens triumphantly in the presence of the disciples (Acts 1:2-9), the Lord as the Victor over Satan, sin, and death, the One who was to be made by God in the heavens both the Lord and Christ, such a One, charged His disciples to be His witnesses, especially of His resurrection and His ascension (2:32-36; 5:30-32), from Jerusalem unto the uttermost part of the earth, by the power of the Spirit (1:8), that is, to announce the gospel of the kingdom of God (8:12) for the establishment of the kingdom of God on the earth (1:3; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31; Rom. 14:17; Eph. 2:19; 5:5). In the book of Acts, the early disciples were witnesses who testified of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension. In Acts the gospel was preached to set up the kingdom of God, so the kingdom is mentioned in both the first and last chapters. Acts 28 says that Paul spoke to people about the kingdom of God (vv. 23, 31). Thus, we go out to preach the gospel to extend the kingdom of God, to gain people so that the kingdom of God may be established on earth.</p>
<p>In Matthew to preach the gospel is to set up the kingdom of the heavens by putting people into the Triune God, making them the citizens of the kingdom of the heavens. In Mark to preach the gospel is to get people out of the old creation into the new creation. In Luke it is to redeem fallen people back to God&rsquo;s original blessing. In John it is to bear fruit for the increase of Christ that His Body can be completed, consummating in the New Jerusalem. Then in Acts it is to set up the kingdom of God. We need to remember these different points.</p><h2 class="head1">III. PETER&rsquo;S REMINDING OF THE BELIEVERS<br />
CONCERNING THE TELLING OUT<br />
OF THE VIRTUES OF GOD</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:9 says, &ldquo;But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.&rdquo; To tell out is to preach, to proclaim, and the virtues of God are the contents of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Corporately by a Chosen Race, a Royal<br />
Priesthood, a Holy Nation, and a People<br />
Acquired for a Possession of God</h2>
<p>This kind of telling out, or proclamation, of God&rsquo;s virtues is a corporate matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. To Proclaim Abroad as the Gospel<br />
the Virtues of God</h2>
<p>We are to proclaim abroad as the gospel the virtues (mercy, compassion, lovingkindness, love, grace, redemption, forgiveness, justification, regeneration, salvation, etc.) of God, who has called the believers out of darkness into His marvelous light for the testimony that the believers as God&rsquo;s chosen race who are under God&rsquo;s bright governmental dealing in His house (1 Pet. 4:17) do not live and walk in darkness but in the marvelous light of God (2:11-12). When we go to people, we should say something to them about all the virtues of God which we have experienced. This is to tell out the virtues of God, to preach the divine attributes to people. We tell people the virtues of God, testifying that we are not living and walking in darkness. We are a people living in the marvelous light of God as a testimony. Regretfully, it seems that today there is not a group of Christians like this. This is why the Lord needs a recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE CALLING OF THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE,<br />
WHO REPRESENT THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God; the bride is the aggregate of all the believers, the church (Rev. 22:17). These two, the Triune God and the believers, become one entity, a couple.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To the Thirsty Ones</h2>
<p>This couple, at the end of the Bible, cries to the thirsty ones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. To Come and Take the Water of Life Freely</h2>
<p>Whosoever is thirsty is called to come and take the water of life freely for their enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God flowing out of the throne of God and of the Lamb as a river of water of life to be the rich supply with Christ as the tree of life to the New Jerusalem as the Triune God&rsquo;s glorious enlargement and expression for eternity (Rev. 21:1&mdash;22:5).</p>
<p>In this message we have seen seven aspects concerning going out to preach the gospel to people. We preach the gospel for seven reasons:</p>
<p>1) To put people into God for the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>2) For the old creation to become the new creation.</p>
<p>3) For the lost man to be redeemed back to God&rsquo;s original blessing.</p>
<p>4) To bear fruit for the increase of Christ to complete Christ&rsquo;s Body, consummating in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>5) To announce the gospel of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>6) To go out to tell people God&rsquo;s virtues, testifying that we as His people do not live in darkness but in the marvelous light. We are people of light.</p>
<p>7) To call the thirsty ones to come and drink the living water to enjoy the Triune God, who is the very river flowing out of His throne to supply all the redeemed with Christ as the tree of life that they all may be the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s enlargement and expression for eternity.</p>
<p>These are the seven aspects of the goal of our preaching the gospel. We also need to keep in mind who the Commissioner of this gospel is. He is the King-Savior, the Slave-Savior, the Man-Savior, and the God-Savior. We have a strong base with a high goal to go out to preach the gospel. This gospel is simple but all-inclusive.</p></body></html>
