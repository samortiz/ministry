   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE FOUNDATION FOR THE SPREAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD S RECOVERY EVERYONE BEING MOBILIZED TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For many years the number of saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei has been around four to five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spiritual life of the saints has been maintained through their meeting regularly, and they have grown in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a positive situation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many brothers and sisters are growing, and many new brothers and sisters are being brought into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, it is time for us to change from merely maintaining our situation to taking action.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church in Taipei must rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though four to five thousand is not a large number, if the saints rise up to move corporately, it will be significant and profitable, and we will be able to accomplish something.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the present strength of our meetings, it should not be a problem to increase our numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It should be easy to double our numbers by next year, and we should also be able to quadruple them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I say this because at least three thousand five hundred saints stood up in the meeting to express their desire to bring one person to the Lord every year.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that next year we can add a minimum of three thousand five hundred new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If every saint brings at least one person to the Lord in the next year, we will double our numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition to this, we should strengthen the preaching of the gospel in our homes and among the students.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By adding these two aspects, we should be able to quadruple our numbers next year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we want to gain people, we all, including the older and the younger saints, must rise up and coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s leading is for everyone to be mobilized as a soldier and to carry out his or her function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE FOCUS OF OUR WORK BEING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BEGETTING, NOURISHING, TEACHING,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AND ADMINISTRATING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this message we will emphasize three matters: truth, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With respect to the gospel, as long as we all preach the gospel, we will have good results.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not difficult to beget children, but nourishing the children is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Teaching or educating children is even harder, because we must be educated first.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We encourage all the saints in the Lord s recovery to beget children; it is good to have many new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, after children are born, we cannot discard them on the side of the road, nor can we abandon them in a nursery school.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must raise them up by nourishing them and giving them an education.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, we must bring them to the proper path.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we beget five thousand children next year, it will be a huge problem to nourish and educate them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we teach them if we are uneducated?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In ancient China it was rare for women to receive an education.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After they were married, they stayed at home to raise children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though the children received their mother s love, they did not receive any education from their mother, because their mother was not educated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In contrast to the situation in ancient Chinese households, the situation in Taiwan today is quite different.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nearly all young females receive a good education, one that is not inferior to the education received by males.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Most young women today have graduated from high school.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, they can bear the responsibility to both nourish and teach their children.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to keep the children whom we beget through preaching the gospel, we must educate them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many do not know much about God, Christ, or redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should know how to teach them these matters, because we have been taught the truth for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only do we have to beget, nourish, and teach; we also have to administrate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we beget someone, we need to nourish and teach him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must also lead him to participate in the proper church life and to function with the saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then he will also be able to beget, nourish, teach, and administrate, and we will be able to continue to gain new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, we must learn how to beget, nourish, teach, and administrate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a couple gets married, they beget children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the children are born, the couple will have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people who get married today do not want to have children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not according to God s will in His creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Likewise, some Christians do not want to beget new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After being saved, they want to pray, fellowship with the Lord, read the Bible, and be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But they do not want to beget and nourish children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To them, begetting children is a suffering as well as a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some brothers refuse to be an elder or a deacon, one who takes care of the saints and bears responsibility in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They want only to be a simple Christian who is not bothered or troubled by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must beget new ones, and we must nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot ask the elders to nourish our children, nor can we put our children in a nursery school.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must nourish them ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From our experience we know that begetting is easy, but nourishing, teaching, and administrating are not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have been begetting people for many years, but we lack adequate care and nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It seems as though we either leave them at home, or we throw them out on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some of our children die from the cold, some starve to death, and some are taken away by other people.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, we must change this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must care for the people whom we beget through preaching the gospel, and we must nourish and teach them in order for them to be sustained.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After teaching them, our care for them must be proper; we must bring them along the proper path, which is to live the proper church life and to function in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This must be the focus of our work.</S>
