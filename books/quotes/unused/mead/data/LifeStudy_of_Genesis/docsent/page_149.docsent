   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE CAIN AND ABEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message, a parenthesis in our study of Genesis 4, we need to see more about Cain and Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During this life-study of Genesis we have pointed out several times that nearly every item found in the first three chapters of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible, especially in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is also true in the case of Cain and Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the revelation of the divine Word, these two brothers should be considered as two important seeds sown in Genesis 4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is proved by the fact that the New Testament speaks of both Cain and Abel Jude 11; 1 John 3:12; Matt 23:35; Heb 11:4; 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus was alluding to Cain in John 8:44 when He said that the Devil "was a murderer from the beginning."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we saw in the previous message, Cain became one with the Devil and, thus, both Cain and the Devil were the murderer of Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus also said that the Devil was a liar: "When he speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own self; for he is a liar and the father of it."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that this also was an allusion to Cain, referring to the lie that he told God when He asked him about his brother Gen 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Cain lied to God in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, Cain was not only a murderer, but also a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the Lord's word in John 8:44 is evidence that the story of Cain in Genesis 4 is a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen that in the beginning man was placed in front of two trees, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge Gen 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These two trees represent two sources out of which two lines continue throughout the whole Bible: the line of the tree of life and the line of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Undoubtedly, Cain was on the line of the tree of knowledge, and Abel was on the line of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Adam and Eve certainly must have produced more children than the two mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the Bible here only mentions Cain and Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why does the Bible only mention these two here?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the intention of the Holy Word is to show us the two categories of people which existed from the beginning of the second human generation: Cain, who represents the line of the tree of knowledge, and Abel, who represents the line of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible ends as it begins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It begins with two trees denoting two sources and it concludes with two cities the great Babylon and the New Jerusalem denoting two consummations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One of these cities is great and the other is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The great Babylon will be the ultimate consummation both of the line of the tree of knowledge and of the seed of Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The seed of Cain is sown in Genesis 4, developed throughout the Old and New Testament, and will be consummated in the great Babylon revealed in Revelation 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, the New Jerusalem will not only be the ultimate consummation of the line of the tree of life, but also of the seed of Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone who will be a part of the New Jerusalem will be an Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every piece of precious stone in that city will be an Abel for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the contrary, the majority of those in the great Babylon will be Cains.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the great Babylon is the ultimate consummation of so many Cains, and the New Jerusalem is the totality of all the Abels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What are you an Abel or a Cain?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that no one reading this message is a Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us now consider these two brothers more thoroughly, examining them in the light of the subsequent books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We begin with Cain.</S>
