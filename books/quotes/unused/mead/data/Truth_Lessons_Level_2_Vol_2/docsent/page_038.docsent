   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Participating in the Kingship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as a Portion of the Birthright</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Judah was not the firstborn and thus should not have participated in the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, because of his love for his brothers, he received the kingship Gen 49:10 as a portion of the birthright; that is, he had the authority to bring God to people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob prophesied in the way of blessing concerning his sons, saying, Judah...thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies....Judah is a young lion...he couches, he lies down as a lion, and as a lioness....The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be Gen 49:8-10, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. This is a picture depicting Judah s fighting and gaining the victory and his resting in victory as a king.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The scepter and the staff represent kingship, or dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The words between his feet are a poetic term denoting seed, or posterity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that Judah has the kingship and that rulers come out of his posterity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ, as Judah s seed, became the Lion of the tribe of Judah Rev 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As such, He has overcome and has been given all authority in heaven and on earth Matt 28:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Christ, as Shiloh, the One who brings peace, comes again, the whole earth will be filled with peace, and all nations will obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They will come to Him to receive God s instruction Isa 2:1-3; 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time, the kingdoms of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>JOSEPH A. Continuing the Way of Life That Chooses God,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>the Way Taken by His Forefathers</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Joseph was special among the sons of Jacob and was separate from his brothers Gen 49:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He continued the way of life that chooses God, the way taken by his forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He lived as a sheaf of life, was full of the riches of life, and was like a bright star shining in the darkness Gen 37:7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although he passed through various trials and sufferings, he was prosperous in all things because he had the presence of God Gen 39:2-5, 21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, he became the representative of all those who are mature in God s life and who reign for God and enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. Suffering the Ill-treatment of His Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Joseph was his father s favorite, and he brought back to his father evil reports about his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, his brothers hated him and could not speak peaceably to him Gen 37:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Joseph had two dreams in which he dreamed that his brothers, signified by sheaves and stars, were bowing down to him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of his dreams, his brothers were jealous of Joseph and hated him even more Gen 37:5-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later, when Joseph, in obedience to his father s command, went to visit his brothers, they conspired against him and almost slew him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Fortunately, his oldest brother, Reuben, rescued him by proposing that they cast him into a pit that was in the wilderness Gen 37:21-22 , and Judah suggested that they sell him to the Ishmaelites Gen 37:25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus he was spared from death and was brought to Egypt and sold to an officer of Pharaoh Gen 37:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way, Joseph suffered all the ill-treatment from his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. Reigning for God</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob signify the three parts of the experience and life of a complete, spiritually mature person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These three parts of such an experience and life eventually produced a mature Israel, one who could reign for God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, he symbolizes one who is mature in the spiritual life and who reigns for God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Genesis 37:2 says, These are the generations of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then it goes on to tell us of the life of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This proves that Joseph s life was a part of Jacob s generation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because of this, the last fourteen chapters of Genesis combine the record of Joseph s life with the record of Jacob s, considering them as the biography of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Joseph was an aspect, a part, of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was Jacob s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Joseph was in power, it was actually Jacob who was reigning through Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Joseph s reigning and ruling over Egypt signifies that all who are spiritually mature will reign for God and rule over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the conclusion of the age of grace, Christ will come back to take the whole earth and set up the millennial kingdom on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time, all those throughout the ages who have been perfected unto the maturity of life will be co-kings with Christ Rev 20:6 , ruling over the nations on earth in the millennial kingdom.</S>
