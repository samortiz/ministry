   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You for the meeting tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You know, Lord, we are coming to a matter in Your holy Word which is most mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We surely need You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without You as the unveiling Spirit, we cannot see this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we trust in You for speaking, for listening, and for understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Defeat Your enemy, who for two thousand years has been deceiving Your people regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In considering the issue of Christ's glorification, we will use a very particular word incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This word is often used in business, but according to my knowledge it has not previously been used in interpreting the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we need to see that the issue of Christ's glorification is the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The issue of Christ's glorification is an incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An incorporation usually involves a number of parties.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What God plans to do in His economy is to incorporate all His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people with Himself as the consummated God into a great incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Gospel of John, a book in which this incorporation is fully unveiled, is composed of three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 1:1 through 12:16 is the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although 7:39 says that "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified," glorification is not covered in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second section, which begins with 12:17 and ends at 17:26, is concerned with Christ's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The issue, the outcome, of this glorification is an incorporation, which is revealed in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The third section, chapters eighteen through twenty-one, covers Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Chapter twelve unveils Christ's glorification in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus said that He was a grain of wheat v.24 , and His intrinsic content the glory of His divinity was concealed within the shell of His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the unique grain of wheat He needed to be put into death so that His intrinsic content could be released.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The issue of this release, this glorification, was the producing of a universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This incorporation is revealed in a full and detailed way in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that the incorporation revealed in chapter fourteen is the issue of the glorification unveiled in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we see this, we will realize that we cannot know chapter fourteen without understanding the glorification in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The main point in chapter fourteen of John is incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verses 20 and 17 the word in is used four times.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These four ins are the base for our understanding of the universal incorporation of the consummated Triune God with the regenerated believers.</S>
