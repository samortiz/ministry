   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THREE THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is altogether a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this mystery has been revealed by God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without the divine speaking, God would remain forever unknowable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But our God no longer is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is not a mystery, but a story.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The story of God is absolutely a matter of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has a history, and His history is a speaking story.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can tell the story of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The story of God is a matter of continual speaking; it is a speaking history.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Firstly, God spoke through some people who were chosen and moved by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He spoke in various ways through Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After Abraham, God spoke through Moses and many other chosen ones priests, kings, and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone who spoke for God, whether he was a king or a prophet, was motivated by God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the history of God is a history of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After God spoke through so many different kinds of people, through high and low, educated and uneducated, kings and shepherds, His speaking was still insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regardless of how much these people were used to speak for God, their speaking was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God had to speak by Himself directly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So He came in the person of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hebrews 1:2 says that God has spoken to us in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the Recovery Version of Hebrews, in 1:1 there is a definite article before the word prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in 1:2 the definite article before Son is in italics, indicating that this word is not in the Greek text, but that it is necessary for the sake of English idiom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the English language it is difficult to say, God spoke to us in Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some of the better versions say, God has spoken to us in the person of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even the Amplified Version uses the phrase in the person of a Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means God Himself speaks in the person of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Formerly He spoke through the prophets; now He speaks in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must see that the Son is different from all the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of the prophets were men used by God to speak for Him, but the Son is God Himself speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 2 says that God has spoken to us in the Son, and verse 8 tells us that the Son is God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that God speaks in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 2 it seems that God and the Son are two, for it says that God spoke in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in verse 8 it is evident that the Son and God are one, for the Son is addressed, O God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To say that God has spoken in the Son means that God speaks in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the four gospels the Son came.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He came to speak God, not only with clear words, but also with what He was and what He did.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is altogether the Word of God and the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes He spoke with words and other times He spoke with actions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All that He was and all that He did spoke God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Son is the Word, the speaking, the expression, and the definition of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Son speaks, His word is the Spirit John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, to the churches, He is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the beginning of each of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the Son speaks, but at the end of each epistle, it is the Spirit speaking to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God speaks in the Son, and when the Son speaks to the churches, He is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By His speaking the churches will become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the end of Revelation the Spirit and the church speak as one Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God speaks in the Son, the Son becomes the speaking Spirit, and the speaking Spirit is one with the church speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the speaking history of our God, a history that is a speaking story.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This speaking story is recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The entire Bible is a history of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we have seen, this history is a speaking story.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When God created all things, He did so by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When He contacted humanity in the Old Testament times, He did it by speaking in the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When He came to mankind in the New Testament age, He spoke in the Son, in the Person of the Son as His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How does He come into the churches today?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By speaking as the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By speaking as the Spirit, He makes Himself one with the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eventually, this speaking story not only consists of Himself, but also of all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Meeting after meeting, the church life is a speaking story.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are a speaking people.</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The book of Hebrews is a book of God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The essence of the letter to the Hebrews is God speaking in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God speaks in the Son, the Son speaks as the Spirit to the churches, and ultimately the Spirit speaks with the church.</S>
