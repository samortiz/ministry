   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND TEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAYING FOR THE HOUSE OF ABIMELECH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham passed his first test.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bringing forth of Ishmael with his fleshly strength was over.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Humanly speaking, he had done everything, and Isaac should have been born.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But before the incident in chapter seventeen was barely completed, another came along, and he was tested a second time concerning the matter of his son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genesis 20:1 says, "And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Abraham committed the same mistake as he did in Egypt when he called Sarah his sister.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After he was rebuked by Pharaoh of Egypt, God brought him back.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But in chapter twenty he went to Abimelech of Gerar and committed the same mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is difficult for us to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How could he fall to such a low state after he had reached the peak of fellowship in chapter eighteen?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter twenty relates something that was not mentioned in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abimelech rebuked Abraham, saying, "What hast thou done unto us?..What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abraham said, "Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the root of this matter was not in Egypt, but in Mesopotamia.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His failure in Egypt only exposed the root.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The root of failure was in Mesopotamia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, when he went to Gerar, the same thing happened again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God dealt with Abraham in order to show him that he and Sarah could not be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Mesopotamia he thought that he and Sarah could be separated, and that during times of peril the couple could become brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Abraham was standing on the ground of faith, while Sarah was standing on the ground of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On man's side, it is faith, and on God's side, it is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Faith and grace can never be separated from each other; they must always be together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If grace is taken away, there is no faith, there is no people of God, and Christ cannot be brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But Abraham thought that he could be separated from Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The root was planted in Mesopotamia and exposed in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now it was exposed again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God was removing the root that had been planted in Mesopotamia.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If this matter had not been taken care of, Isaac could not have been brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order for God's people to maintain His testimony, there is the need for faith and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not enough to have faith alone, and it is not enough to have grace alone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God showed Abraham that he could not sacrifice Sarah and could not be separated from her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is interesting that "the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife" v. 18 . After Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, "Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children" v. 17 . After this incident, Sarah begot Isaac in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is amazing.</S>
