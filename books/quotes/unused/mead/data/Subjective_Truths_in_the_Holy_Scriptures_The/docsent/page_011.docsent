   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Significance of the Numbers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are speaking not of the anointing of oil but the anointing of ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The oil consists of only one element, the olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ointment, however, is one element, the olive oil, plus four kinds of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you study the type carefully, you will discover several points.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, in number the spices are four.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible, the number four signifies creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to our creation, we are all number fours; we are the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, these four spices are all plants.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In biblical typology, plants refer to the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since four refers to creatures and plants refer to humanity, this tells us that the four kinds of spices refer to the created man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The created man is mingled with the number one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The one single element is the olive oil; it is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Bible, the number one denotes the unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here in this type we see that the created man is mingled with the unique God to become five.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Bible, five is the number for responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Look at your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One thumb plus four fingers can bear responsibility to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if the thumb or any of the four fingers is missing, it is hard to accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God without man has no way, and also man without God has no way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Four," the created ones, plus "one," the Creator, become "five."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This five is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, the condition of some people is such that God is "one" and they are "four," but the two have not become "five."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, today we are all number fives.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Originally we were number fours, but now, since there is the number one added into us, we have become number fives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am really happy that today I am number five because I have God so that "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me" Phil 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were originally the created men, but now the Creator God has been added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Significance of the Ingredients</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, we see that originally the holy anointing oil was solely oil, but with the addition of the four kinds of spices, the ingredients in it increased and it became an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the four kinds of spices signify the created man, and each item is full of significance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus is myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This refers to His being a Man who was sweet in His suffering and in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He suffered His whole life on earth; He was obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both His suffering and His death were so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was a Man who suffered and who died.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was a sweet suffering One and a sweet dying One.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He truly is the sweet myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is also the fragrant cinnamon, which is a very good seasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Westerners often use cinnamon in their cooking because it is such a good seasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's human living with His behavior is really a seasoning, and it causes our human life to be full of fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you add the Lord Jesus into you, you will become fragrant cinnamon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is also calamus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the meaning in Hebrew, calamus is a reed that grows out of a marsh or a muddy place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This signifies His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was not only a Man who died but also a Man who resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He grew out of the marsh of death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Finally, He is cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the ancient Jews, cassia has the power to repel snakes and poisonous insects.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In ancient times, the sanitary conditions were not very good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There were many poisonous insects, but if cassia was placed in the room, all the poisonous insects, and the snakes in particular, would not come.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This signifies the resurrection power of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The resurrection power of the Lord Jesus repels the devil, snakes, and scorpions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, you can see that these four spices signify the Lord Jesus who suffered death, who was fragrant and sweet, who resurrected, and who drove away the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This One was added to the unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In other words, before the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God had only divinity the unique olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, after His incarnation, death, and resurrection, He compounded His humanity, which was a dying and sweet humanity, with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He also compounded His resurrection and the resurrection power that drove away the devil with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today this Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today in the Spirit of God, there is not only divinity but also humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are also the power of the Lord Jesus' suffering, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection, which is the power to drive away the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, this is not merely oil but an ointment; this is not merely the Spirit of God but "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before the Lord's death and resurrection, the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After the Lord's resurrection, the Spirit came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today this Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
