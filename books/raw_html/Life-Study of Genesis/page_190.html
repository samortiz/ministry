<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Enosh's Way of Calling</H2><P>The third godly way that Noah inherited was Enosh's way of calling on the name of the Lord to enjoy all that He is (4:26). This was an addition to the first two godly ways. It was not only a matter of being saved or of pleasing God, but of participating in and enjoying what God is by calling on His name. We may partake of the riches of God by calling on the name of the Lord. Noah must have practiced this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. All the Fathers' Way of Living and Begetting</H2><P>Noah also inherited the way of living and begetting (5:3-28). Noah, like his forefathers, was not idle, but was living with a purpose for God and begetting children for man's proper multiplication that God's purpose might be fulfilled on this earth through mankind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Enoch's Way of Walking with God</H2><P>Noah also inherited the fifth way, the way of walking with God (5:22, 24). How good it is that a fallen man can walk with God! Although it is marvelous to see that a fallen man can be saved, we must further realize that such a person can walk with God. In the seventh human generation, Enoch discovered the way of walking with God.</P><P>We can be saved, please God, call on His name, live and beget, and walk with God. What else do we want? It seems that we have been fully satisfied. We are saved; we can please God; we can call on His name to enjoy all that He is to us; we can live with a purpose and beget, that is, bear fruit, for God's multiplication; and we can walk with God. What do we lack? Nothing. We are pleased and satisfied. However, God has not been satisfied. This is the burden that the Lord has shown me. It is inadequate simply to see that Noah inherited all the godly ways of his forefathers. If this ministry only helps you to see this much, it has failed God. We must see something more.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Receiving More Revelation</H2><P>God gave Noah what was nearly an all-inclusive revelation, a further revelation which none of Noah's forefathers saw. Although Enoch prophesied that when his son Methuselah died the deluge would come (the meaning of the name "Methuselah"), and that God's judgment would be executed upon the corrupted earth, and although he even prophesied about the Lord's coming (Jude 14), Enoch never received the vision of the way that God would terminate the corrupted generation and bring in a new age. None of Noah's forefathers saw this revelation. One day, God came to Noah and revealed it to him. As a result of this, Noah's view of godly things was greatly broadened, and he saw much more than all his forefathers did. He saw the vision and received a definite revelation from God. We all need such a revelation.</P><P>In principle, our situation is exactly the same as Noah's. Today's generation is corrupt, and the earth is filled with evil and violence. It seems that, according to man's concept, God has been defeated and driven out of the earth. However, do you not realize that today there is a big "but"? Some dear ones have inherited all the godly ways of the saints from the first century of the Christian era until the present. We have inherited all the godly ways that were exercised in the past centuries. But should we stop here? Should we say, "Look at what we have"? No. Although we have inherited so many godly things and are satisfied and contented, how about God? How about God's purpose? God needs to terminate this age. He needs a change of generation. He needs an ark that can bring His people out of this generation and start a new age. God needs an ark. I have seen this and I cry out for this.</P><P>Have you been saved? Praise the Lord! Do you have a way to please God? Thank the Lord for this. Can you call on His name to partake of His riches? Since 1967, we have practiced this matter of calling on the name of the Lord. Are you living and begetting? Yes, day by day we are living for the Lord and are begetting for the Lord's multiplication. Are you satisfied? Hallelujah, we are satisfied. But what about God and His purpose? Do you realize that God intends to terminate this generation and bring in another age? In order to do this, He must have an ark. We cannot build the ark by our imagination. Like Noah, we must receive a revelation concerning God's need of the ark.</P>
