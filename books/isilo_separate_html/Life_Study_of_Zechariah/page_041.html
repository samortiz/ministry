The Lord Visiting<br>the House of Judah as His Flock</H2><P>"Jehovah of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, / And will make them like His horse of majesty in battle" (Zech. 10:3b). God came to His people in such a gracious way to visit them. His visiting them was Christ's coming to them. He came in the man, Jesus. Of course, chapter ten does not mention the name Jesus Christ or Messiah, but the word visited here should be understood as Christ's coming. Two thousand years ago He came in the form of a man.</P><P>This portion of the Word speaks about the Shepherd of God's flock. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus likened Himself to a shepherd. He came as the real Shepherd and blamed the other shepherds, who were the elders, the scribes, and the priests. They were the wrong shepherds, but the Lord Jesus was the unique Shepherd. He even told us that He was the good Shepherd who gave up His life for the sheep (John 10:11, 14-15). On the one hand, the Lord punished the false shepherds; on the other hand, He, the real Shepherd, has visited His flock.</P><P>By visiting His flock He makes them like a horse of majesty. Are you a sheep or a horse of majesty? We all need to progress so that we are no longer sheep but horses of majesty. After being touched by the Shepherd, every weak sheep will become a horse of majesty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. From Judah Coming Forth the Cornerstone,<br>the Peg, the Battle Bow, and Every Ruler Together</H2><P>Zechariah 10:4 continues, "From him will come forth the cornerstone, from him the peg, / From him the battle bow, / From him every ruler together." The pronoun him used three times in this verse refers to Judah in the previous verse. Verse 4 indicates that when we become horses of majesty, we become a source of cornerstones, pegs, battle bows, and rulers. When we become horses, we produce these four kinds of things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The House of Judah and the People of Ephraim<br>Being as Mighty Men Trampling Their Enemies</H2><P>The house of Judah and the people of Ephraim will be as mighty men trampling their enemies, for Jehovah is with them (v. 5). Jehovah will strengthen the house of Judah and will save the house of Joseph. Jehovah will bring them back, for He has had compassion on them, and it will be as though Jehovah had not rejected them. Jehovah is their God, and He will answer them (v. 6). Their hearts will rejoice as if with wine, and their hearts will exult in Jehovah (v. 7). This should be our situation and condition in the church life today.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
