In the fall of last year, Brother Lee Shu Jen went there and rented a building for a gospel conference. He was blessed by the Lord, and in no time, several lovely young men and women received the Lord and became Christians. Brother Lee established the table for them in the building he had rented. From that time, some brothers from the denominations also came over and began to break bread with them. The Lord gradually added a number of saved ones to them. They had a conference recently and were greatly blessed by the Lord. On the day that the conference was over, eight brothers and sisters were baptized. (Three of them were from other localities.) Now there are more than ten brothers and sisters in the table meeting, and more than thirty come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet. Brothers Lee Shu Jen, Chou Chi Chang, and Hu You San bear the responsibility for the work and the affairs together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning of the Meeting in Ch'ien Ts'ang</H2><P>Ch'ien Ts'ang is about ten miles from the Ao River. Although it is not a big place, the denominations are very developed there. There are the China Inland Mission, an Independent Church, and the Catholic Church. There are many leaders who are very zealous for the denominations, more than in other localities. In the spring of 1932, some brothers and sisters from the Independent Church went to a conference in Feng Ch'uan and heard the word of the truth there. They were very moved, and later they consulted with us. We decided to have a conference in Ch'ien Ts'ang in April. After that conference, a few brothers rose up and changed their form of worship, but that brought opposition from their leaders. There was more opposition here than in other places. They forbade the singing of hymns from the Little Flock Hymnal and did not allow the brothers who loved the truth to preach the Word. Every Lord's Day there was only criticism and scolding from the pulpit. When the brothers and sisters who love the Lord saw this condition, they were really sad. Finally, some of the brothers who were in one accord went to the church building every Lord's Day evening to have the Lord's table meeting. The rest of those who were not in one accord did not attend. They did this for more than a year. The brothers felt that this condition of mixture with the denominations was not according to the principle of the Bible. They wanted to leave, so they looked for another building, but because they did not know how the sisters felt, they continued in the same way for awhile. On the first Lord's Day in March of this year, they were led by the Lord, and the sisters agreed, so they began to have the table meeting in a brother's house. Now there are only three brothers and three sisters breaking bread together. Although they are very lonely, they are very joyful. One of the sister's husbands, Sister Lin Chih Min's, is still holding on to the denominations. Her husband is very upset that she has left the denomination and often is angry with her. I ask the brothers and sisters in all the localities to pray for this sister and ask the Lord to preserve her so that she will stand faithfully. There is a brother, Su Chih San, who also obeys the Lord very much. Unfortunately, he cannot come out to break bread with the brothers because his father is the strongest opposer of the truth. If his son were to leave the denominations, there would be great trouble. So this brother has to wait awhile. May the brothers and sisters pray for him that the Lord would release him to freely worship.</P><P>Chen Ching Fa<br>April 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM KULIN, CHIUCHIANG</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters who faithfully love the Lord:</P><P>We two weak and useless ones want to describe by the Lord's grace how He raised up the table in Kulin and its condition so that the brothers and sisters will know and glorify God and our Lord together. But we are truly afraid that as we are telling this our flesh will be brought in to take away some of God's glory. Therefore, we pray and beg the almighty God to bind our self in this matter so that what we mention will be completely the truth and what God wants us to mention.</P><P>In the spring of 1931, we began to have the meetings. At that time there were four brothers and four sisters in the meetings. Among the four brothers, two were also in the denominations. At that time we still did not break the bread. In the summer, some brothers and sisters from Shanghai came to Kulin to rest. We thought that we could break the bread then. But it did not happen because some people in the Brethren Assembly misunderstood. We received the Lord's leading on December 6, a Lord's Day. (The two brothers in the denominations left Kulin.) We started practicing the table meeting on that day. The number of attendants in that meeting was four brothers (one Western and three Chinese) and five sisters (one Western and four Chinese). Thank the Lord, He led us Himself. Although we did not understand much, He took care of us in everything. He used His Holy Spirit to teach us how to obey Him. By the summer of 1932, He added a number of brothers and sisters. At that time, the pastors of the denominations said we were the Church of the Little Flock. (They misunderstood us because we sang from the Little Flock Hymnal.)</P><P>In November 1932, we went together to Shanghai for the meeting. Three days after we left Kulin, one of the brothers among us, Liu Heng Li, was suddenly taken by the Lord. Satan attacked us especially at that time, causing many difficulties in the meeting, which we weak ones could not resolve. But thank the almighty Lord; He is the beginning, and He is the end. He bore for us the responsibility which we could not bear. There is nothing He cannot do. We thank Him and praise Him and give glory to His name.</P><P>Thank the Lord, this year He chose for Himself our Brother Cheng Tso to come and be in one accord with us. When Brother Cheng was in the meeting in Shanghai this year, he received the Lord's light to know that the Lord wants us to serve Him more than He wants us to work for Him. Therefore, we must learn how to serve Him in the house of God and how to walk in His will. There is a (Western) brother who exhorted him to go out and do a labor of sweat (preaching by his own strength). He knew that it was not God's will and refused. Later, Satan brought all kinds of persecution and sufferings to him. He endured completely in order to obey the Lord and glorify Him. As a result, the Lord was Victor! We also feel deeply that the Lord allowed all this to come upon him so that our brother would know Him more.</P><P>Now there are eight brothers (six Chinese and two Western) and eleven sisters (three Chinese and eight Western) in our meeting. Altogether there are nineteen breaking bread together to remember the Lord.</P><P>Now it seems that there are two brothers (the Western ones), who cannot be absolutely one with us regarding the matter of the rapture. (They believe that the entire body of believers will be raptured at once.) We receive them at the table meeting only because they are saved believers.</P><P>We two brothers bear the burden of all the responsibility of the meeting by the Lord's grace. We only hope that the brothers and sisters who love the Lord do not forget to pray for us, your weak brothers.</P><P>The place of our meeting is now at Number Ninety-four in the winter and on the second floor of Number Thirty-six in the summer. The meeting times are as follows: Wednesday evening at 8:00 p.m., singing and Bible study meeting; Saturday evening at 8:00 p.m., prayer meeting; Lord's Day morning at 10:00 a.m., table meeting.</P><P>The locality of Kulin is very important. There are more than twenty denominations here. We really feel the need of the work. We also hope the Lord will send His own workers to come and explain the truth to enlighten His children. We place this matter in the Lord's hands and before the brothers and sisters. We ask the brothers and sisters to pray and ask that all the Lord's truth may shine in each place during this last age. Amen. We greet you with this.</P><P>Peace to all the brothers and sisters.</P><P>Your little brothers,<br>Yu Hsin Liang and Chi Wen Tsao<br>May 8, 1934, in Kulin</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
