   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Abstaining from Wine</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and from Anything Related to Its Source</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar made from wine or strong drink, and shall not drink any juice of grapes or eat grapes, fresh or dried.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made from the grapevine, not even the seeds or the skins" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we see that a Nazarite had to abstain from wine and anything related to its source.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This signifies abstaining from the earthly enjoyment and pleasure cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psa 104:15; Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To abstain from all kinds of wine is to abstain from all kinds of earthly enjoyment and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should be careful of anything earthly that makes us happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Earthly pleasure leads to lustful conduct and to a lustful intention.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Earthly enjoyment and pleasure would defile a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A Nazarite had to abstain from vinegar made from wine, from the juice of grapes, and from grapes fresh or dried.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This signifies abstaining from anything that issues in earthly enjoyment or pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Vinegar is classified with wine because the source is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wine, vinegar, and grape juice are all prohibited.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From this we see that the one who is absolute for God is altogether separated from anything of earthly pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows the absoluteness of the Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>D. Not Shaving the Head</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall come upon his head.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Until the completion of the days for which he separated himself to Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the hair of his head grow freely" Num 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not shaving the head signifies not rejecting the headship of the Lord cf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 Cor 11:3, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be a Nazarite we must take care of two things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, we must have nothing to do with earthly pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, we must be absolutely under authority, absolutely under the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The shaving of one's head signifies the rejecting of the headship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spiritually speaking, for us to shave our head means that we cast off the Lord's authority over us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Nazarite was to let his hair grow long freely ; that is, he was to remain in subjection to the Lord's headship, wherein is the power Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today is a day of lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we were to do away with the police and close the courts, society would be full of robbers and murderers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We could not bear to live in such an intolerable situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The United States of America has an excellent constitution, and based upon this constitution there are strong laws and many courts to see that these laws are carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone who appears in a court of law must submit to the laws of the United States government.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, the entire society would be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fallen race is a rebellious race.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The rebellious nature is still within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, it would be dangerous to be in a situation in which there is no deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the reason God established human government Gen 9:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The entire government is a deputy authority representing God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Speaking of this, Paul says, "Let every person be subject to the authorities over them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore he who resists the authority opposes what God has appointed" Rom 13:1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Teachers, employers, and police officers are deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everywhere on earth there is deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let us apply this matter of deputy authority to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is there deputy authority in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there is no deputy authority in the church, why are there elders?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Recently, some have said that there is no deputy authority in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If such a claim is true, why does the New Testament tell us that there are elders in the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Surely, Christ is the Head, and the authority is the Spirit, but we still need elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without elders, the church would be in anarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is also deputy authority in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The parents are the deputy authority to the children Eph 6:1 , and the husbands are the deputy authority to the wives Eph 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul even says that a wife should fear her husband Eph 5:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For a wife to fear her husband means that she takes him as the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even in a small family there is deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then how much more should there be deputy authority in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Two particular characteristics, or two signs, of a Nazarite are, first, that he does not touch any worldly pleasure and, second, that he always keeps himself under some authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These are solemn matters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As those who would be absolute for God, we must abstain from earthly pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, we must not shave our head; that is, we must respect authority and remain under the headship of our Lord in every way.</S>
