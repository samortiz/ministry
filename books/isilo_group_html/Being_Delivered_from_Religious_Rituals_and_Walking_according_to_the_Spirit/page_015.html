<h1 class="title">CHRIST VERSUS RELIGION<br />
INDICATING THAT CHRIST IS THE HEAD<br />
CARING FOR HIS BODY</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that Christ is five new items in the Gospel of Matthew. He is everything new. He is the Bridegroom, the new cloth, the new garment, the new wine, and the new wineskin. With Him nothing is old; everything is new. The book of Matthew also shows that Christ is versus religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BREAKING THE SABBATH IN MATTHEW 12:1-2<br />
INDICATING THAT HE IS THE HEAD</h2>
<p>In chapter 12 the Lord Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath (v. 1). Why did the Lord go through the grainfields? Was He lost, or was He walking aimlessly? Everything that the Lord did was full of meaning. Grainfields are certainly not the place to hold a meeting. Grainfields contain food to eat, but eating in a grainfield can be done only in a crude way. Furthermore, the Lord went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. The Lord did not go through the grainfields during the first six days of the week. He waited until the seventh day. I believe that the Lord chose to do this on the seventh day, the Sabbath day, with the intention of showing the Pharisees that He wants to overthrow religion.</p>
<p>The Lord went through the grainfields on the Sabbath, but why did the Pharisees also go to the grainfields? Perhaps the Pharisees were looking to see if there were people in the grainfields breaking the Sabbath. When the Lord Jesus and His disciples went through the grainfields, they picked ears of grain and ate, and the Pharisees saw them. This event shows that the Lord did not come to keep religious regulations or to care about cultural tradition. He did things on the Sabbath that broke the Sabbath. On the Sabbath the Lord went through the grainfields with His disciples, and His disciples ate ears of grain. The disciples ate in a way that was against the regulations; they ate the grains raw and in a crude way. The Lord did not care for religion or culture. He cared only for the reality of Himself.</p>
<p>Is the church a holy temple, a chapel, or a grainfield? The church should be a grainfield. Our meeting is a grainfield, and the local church is also a grainfield. If the saints come to the meetings in order to keep regulations, they will remain hungry, and our meetings will have the nature of a chapel. What is the significance of a grainfield? There are no regulations in a grainfield. There is only food to satisfy people. The Lord&rsquo;s disciples picked ears of grain and ate in a crude way, without plates and bowls. Outwardly they were crude, but they had enjoyment and real satisfaction. They did not have the outward Sabbath, but they had rest within.</p>
<p>The Jews were keeping religious regulations, but the Lord did not keep the regulations; instead, He went to the grainfields. This indicates that the Lord did things contrary to religion and culture so that His disciples would be satisfied. When the Pharisees saw the Lord&rsquo;s disciples picking ears of grain and eating them, they said to the Lord, &ldquo;Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath&rdquo; (v. 2). This means that the disciples had profaned the Sabbath. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). The Lord&rsquo;s words are very meaningful. They imply that He is today&rsquo;s David and that the disciples who follow Him are following the real David. David the king was only a shadow. The Lord is the substance, the real David.</p>
<p>The bread of the Presence in the temple was for the priests to eat. The Lord&rsquo;s words indicate that the age of the priesthood was over. Just as the age was changed when David became the king, the Lord&rsquo;s coming changed the age. Christ is not only the greater David and the real David; He is also the One who has changed the age. The coming of David changed the age from the age of the priests to the age of the kings. Now that the Lord is here, the age has changed from the age of the Old Testament to the age of the New Testament. In the Old Testament age people kept the Sabbath, but in the New Testament age the Lord is our Sabbath. Thank the Lord that the age has changed. Since the Lord is the real David, those who follow Him should not be hungry. When we meet together to worship the Lord, we are satisfied within. The more we worship, the more we are satisfied. The Lord Jesus does not care for regulation; He cares for our being fed and satisfied.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke a further word to the Pharisees in verse 5: &ldquo;Have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?&rdquo; These words indicate that even if the age had not changed from the age of the priesthood to that of the kingship, the priests who labor in the temple on the Sabbath are guiltless. Hence, the regulation of the Sabbath is effective only outside the temple; there is no such regulation inside the temple. Once a person is inside the temple, he is free. The Lord also said, &ldquo;I say to you that something greater than the temple is here&rdquo; (v. 6). The Lord Jesus is greater than the temple. Since His disciples were doing things in Him, the One who is greater than the temple, they were guiltless. Outside of Christ we are in bondage, but in Christ we are set free.</p>
<p>Are we in Christ or outside of Christ? We are in Christ! There is freedom in the temple, but here is One who is greater than the temple. Christ is not only the greater David but also the greater temple. He is David who gives us satisfaction, and He is the temple that sets us free.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath&rdquo; (v. 8). The Lord Jesus is the Lord. If He wants to establish the Sabbath, He will establish it, and if He wants to do away with the Sabbath, He will do away with it. He is not only the real David and the greater temple, but He is also the Lord of the Sabbath. These items show that He is Christ, the Head. Jesus is Lord! In Him we have satisfaction, freedom, and rest.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Delivered from Religious Rituals and Walking according to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
