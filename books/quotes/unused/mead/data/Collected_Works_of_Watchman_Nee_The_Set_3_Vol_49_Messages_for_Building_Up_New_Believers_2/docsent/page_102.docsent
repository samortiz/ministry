   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Teaching Children to Choose</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I hope that we will pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In many aspects we have to teach our children according to the discipline of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From their youth, we should give them a chance to make their own choices.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not make every choice for them until they reach the age of eighteen or twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do, it will be impossible for them to make any decisions when they grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to always give them the opportunity to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Give them the chance to choose what they like and what they do not like.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to show them whether their choices are right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Give them the chance to choose and then show them the right choice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let them see it for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some like to wear short dresses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some prefer one kind of color, while others prefer another kind of color.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let them make the choices by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people do not give their children the opportunity to make choices.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a result, when their children reach their twenties and marry someone, they do not know how to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You can tell them that the husband is the head of the wife, but they will not know how to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must not allow them to wait until they are married to find out that they do not know how to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If at all possible, give your children plenty of opportunity to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they grow up, they will then know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will know what is wrong and what is right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Give a child opportunities to make choices from the time he is young.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I will say a word to all those who have children: "Give them a chance to choose."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, many Chinese children will be damaged when they grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The damage is often manifested when the children are between the ages of eighteen and twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They act in irresponsible ways at this age because they have never been called upon to make any choices.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must teach our children according to the discipline of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must teach our children to make choices rather than making all the choices for them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to let our children know whether they have made the right choices.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Teaching Children to Manage Things</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must also teach our children to manage things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must give them the opportunity to take care of their personal belongings, to manage their own shoes, socks, and other affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Give them a little instruction and then let them try to manage things by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let them know how things should be handled from their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some children have a bad start because their fathers love them blindly and do not know how to train them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As Christians, we have to train our children to manage their things properly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe if the Lord is gracious to us, we will gain half of our increase from among our own children and the other half from the "sea" i.e., the world .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If all the increase is from the sea and none is from among our own children, we will not have a strong church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul's generation could be saved directly from the world, but the generation after Paul, men like Timothy, came in through their families.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot expect our increase to always come from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to expect the second generation, men like Timothy, to come from our own families.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's gospel does save men from the world, but we also need to bring in men like Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before the church will be rich, there must be grandmothers like Lois and mothers like Eunice who raise, edify, and nurture their children in the discipline of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there are no such people, the church will never be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must give our children the opportunity to manage things from their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must give them the chance to learn to arrange things by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hold family meetings frequently and allow the children to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we have to rearrange the furniture, involve them in its rearrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we have to rearrange the cupboard, involve them in its rearrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Teach them to manage things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether we have daughters or sons, we have to teach them to manage things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then they will become a good husband or a good wife in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is our situation today?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Girls should be cared for by their mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But many mothers do not take care of them, and the burden is turned over to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Boys should be cared for by their fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But many fathers do not take care of them, and the burden is also passed on to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a consequence, as men are saved and brought into the church, the business burden of the church doubles.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is because those who are parents do not live properly as Christian parents.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the church preaches the gospel and saves men, it has to deal with all kinds of family problems associated with these men.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if parents are responsible for the proper nurturing of their children, and if the children are brought up in the church, the church will be relieved of half of its burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Shanghai I have often felt that the workers should not be handling the many affairs that they handle; those affairs should be handled by the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The parents do not teach their children well, and these children drift into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, we have to rescue them back from the world and pick up the burden of teaching them ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This creates much work for the church.</S>
