   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The truths referred to in this book have been gradually learned and practiced during the past years.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Numerous adjustments have been made as greater light has been received, and if we remain humble, and God still shows us mercy, we believe there will be further adjustments in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord has graciously given us a number of associates in the work, all of whom have been sent forth on the basis mentioned in this book, and through their labors numerous churches have been established in different parts of China.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Though conditions are vastly different in these many churches, and the believers connected with them differ greatly too in background, education, social standing, and spiritual experience yet we have found that if, under the absolute lordship of Jesus, we come to see the heavenly pattern of church formation and government, then the scriptural methods are both practicable and fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While the book itself may seem to deal with the technical side of Christianity, let us emphasize here that we are not aiming at mere technical correctness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is spiritual reality we are after.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But spirituality is not a matter of theory; it always issues in practice; and it is with spirituality in its practical out-working that this book deals.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is wearisome to me, if not actually repulsive, to talk with those who aim at perfect outward correctness, while they care little for that which is vital and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Missionary methods, as such, do not interest me at all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In fact, it is a deep grief to meet children of God who know practically nothing of the hatefulness of a life lived in the natural energy of man, and know little of vital experience of the headship of Jesus Christ, yet all the while are scrupulously careful to arrive at absolute correctness of method in God's service.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many a time we have been told, "We agree with you in everything."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Far from it!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In reality we do not agree at all!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We hope this book will not fall into the hands of those who wish to improve their work by improving their methods, without adjusting their relationship to the Lord; but we do hope it will have a message for the humble ones who have learned to live in the power of the Spirit and have no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is death to have a wineskin without wine, but it is loss to have wine without a wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must have the wineskin after we have the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul wrote the Ephesian Epistle, but he could also write the Corinthian Epistle; and Corinthians presents us with Ephesian truths in practical expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yes, the writer of Ephesians was also the writer of Corinthians!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But why is it that the children of God have never had any serious contentions over Ephesian truths, but always over Corinthian truths?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the sphere of Ephesians is the heavenlies, and its truths are purely spiritual, so if there is any diversity of opinion concerning them, no one feels it much; but Corinthian teachings are practical and touch the earthly sphere, so if there is the slightest difference of opinion, a reaction is felt at once.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, Corinthians is very practical!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And it tests our obedience more than does Ephesians!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The danger, with those who know little about life and reality, is to emphasize mere outward correctness; but with those to whom life and reality are a matter of supreme importance, the temptation is to throw away the divine pattern of things, thinking it legal and technical.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They feel that they have the greater and can therefore well dispense with the lesser.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, the more spiritual a man is, the freer he feels to do as he thinks fit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He considers that he himself has authority to decide on outward matters, and rather fancies that to ignore God's commands regarding them is an indication that he has been delivered from legality and is walking in the liberty of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But God has not only revealed the truths that concern our inner life; He has also revealed the truths relating to the outward expression of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God prizes the inner reality, but He does not ignore its outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has given us Ephesians, Romans, and Colossians, but He has also given us Acts, the Epistles to Timothy, and the Epistles to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may think it sufficient for God to instruct us through Romans, Ephesians, and Colossians as to our life in Christ, but He has considered it necessary to instruct us through Acts, Corinthians, and Timothy, how to do His work and how to organize His Church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has left nothing to human imagination or human will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man is afraid to use a thoughtless servant, but God does not care to use an over-thoughtful one; all He requires of man is simple obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Who has become His counselor?" asked Paul Rom 11:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man would fain occupy the post, but God has no need of a counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not our place to suggest how we think divine work should be done, but rather to ask in everything, "What is the will of the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Pharisees cleansed the outside of the platter, but left the inside full of impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our Lord rebuked them for setting so much store on outward things, and ignoring the inward; and many of God's people conclude from the Lord's rebuke that, providing we stress the inner side of spiritual truth, all is well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But God demands both inward and outward purity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To have the outer without the inner is spiritual death, but to have the inner without the outer is only spiritualized life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And spiritualization is not spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our Lord said, "These you should have done and not neglected the others" Matt 23:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No matter how insignificant any divine command may seem, it is an expression of the will of God; therefore, we never dare treat it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot neglect the least of His commands with impunity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The importance of His requirements may vary, but everything that is of God has eternal purpose and eternal worth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, the mere observance of outward forms of service has no spiritual value whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All spiritual truths, whether pertaining to the inner or the outer life, are liable to be legalized.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything that is of God whether outward or inward if in the Spirit is life; if in the letter it is death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So the question is not whether it is outward or inward, but whether it is in the Spirit or in the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life" 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is our desire to accept and proclaim the whole Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We covet to be able to say with Paul, "I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God" Acts 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We seek to follow the leading of God's Spirit, but at the same time we seek to pay attention to the examples shown us in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The leading of the Spirit is precious, but if there is no example in the Word, then it is easy to substitute our fallible thoughts and unfounded feelings for the Spirit's leading, drifting into error without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If one is not prepared to obey God's will in every direction, it is easy to do things contrary to His Word and still fancy one is being led of His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We emphasize the necessity of following both the leading of the Spirit and the examples of the Word, because by comparing our ways with the written Word we can discover the source of our leading.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit's guidance will always harmonize with the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God cannot lead a man one way in Acts and another way today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In externalities the leading may vary, but in principle it is always the same; for God's will is eternal, therefore changeless.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God is the eternal God; He takes no cognizance of time, and His will and ways all bear the stamp of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This being so, God could never act one way at one time and another way later on.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Circumstances may differ and cases may differ, but in principle the will and ways of God are just the same today as they were in the days of the Acts.</S>
