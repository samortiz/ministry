   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to what concept was Psalm 1 written?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Is Psalm 1 good or not?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Surely it is a good psalm, yet it was written according to the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Psalm 1 the psalmist said that the one who delighted in the law of Jehovah would prosper in everything that he does, but eventually the psalmists were not prospering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Psalm 73, the psalmist was bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He thought that he had cleansed his heart in vain because he was being plagued and chastened vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the other hand, he saw all the evil ones prospering v. 3 . He was bothered until he went into the sanctuary of God, the temple of God v. 17 . Then he received the revelation, and he was led to have nothing in the heavens nor anything on the earth but God v. 25 . So, he declared that God was his living portion v. 26 ; not the law, but the very God Himself was his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that Psalm 1 is good, but it was written with a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The law was not given for us to keep for our prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, the law was given to expose us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The writer of Psalm 1, David, was exposed by the law as being a murderer and a robber of someone's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of what he had done, the situation with his entire family became a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fornication and murder were among his children 2 Sam 13:1-29 , and rebellion came from his son, Absalom 15:7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third psalm was a psalm of David when he was fleeing from his rebellious son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, we should not highly appraise Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was written wrongly with a wrong concept, a human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now let us read Psalm 2:</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why are the nations in an uproar,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And why do the peoples contemplate a vain thing?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The kings of the earth take their stand,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And the rulers take counsel together,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Against Jehovah and against His Anointed: Let us break apart their bonds</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And cast their ropes away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He who sits in the heavens laughs;</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord has them in derision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then He will speak to them in His anger,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And by His burning wrath He will terrify them: But I have installed My King</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Upon Zion, My holy mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I will recount the decree of Jehovah;</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said to Me: You are My Son;</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today I have begotten You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ask of Me,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And I will give the nations as Your inheritance</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And the limits of the earth as Your possession.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You will break them with an iron rod;</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will shatter them like a potter's vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now therefore, O kings, be prudent;</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Take the admonition, O judges of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Serve Jehovah with fear,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And rejoice with trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Kiss the Son</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Lest He be angry and you perish from the way;</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For His anger may suddenly be kindled.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Blessed are all those who take refuge in Him.</S>
