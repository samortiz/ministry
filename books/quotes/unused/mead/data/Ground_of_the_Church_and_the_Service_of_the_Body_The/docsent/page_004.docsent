   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCHES BEING LOCAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE WORKERS BEING EXTRA-LOCAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people may ask, Are there workers in the local church?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we read the entire New Testament carefully, we will see that there were no apostles in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sphere of the work of an apostle is extra-local.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 13:1 says, Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surprisingly, there is no mention of apostles in the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Neither does one find apostles in other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, 1 Corinthians 12:28 says, God has placed some in the church: first apostles...</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can we explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On one hand, there are no apostles in the local church; on the other hand, the Bible says that God has placed apostles in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we read these portions carefully, we will come to the conclusion that although there are no apostles in the local church, there are apostles in the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many local churches in the universal church, but there are no apostles in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The apostles are only in the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the apostles time there were two regions: the Jewish region and the Gentile region.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter and John were apostles among the Jews in the Jewish region, and Paul and Barnabas were apostles among the Gentiles in the Gentile region.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read the New Testament carefully, we can tell whether a church was composed mostly of Jewish believers or Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The universal church consists of these two regions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In each of these regions there were particular apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The churches in these regions there were established by the apostles laboring among them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, within the Jewish and Gentile regions there were many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By reading Acts we can see that Peter and John, as apostles in the Jewish region, established churches in that region.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They established the church in Jerusalem, and through the laying on of hands, they established the church in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul and his co-workers established churches in the Gentile region.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in the universal church there are two regions and many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Workers labor in a region and establish churches locality by locality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE CHURCH AND THE WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Churches are local, whereas workers are extra-local.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we need to consider the relationship between the church and the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When an apostle is raised up, it means that this apostle has been sent to establish churches locality by locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, the local churches, the elders, and the deacons are all established by the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, an apostle can be said to be the highest authority in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Apostles do not belong to any local church; they are workers laboring extra-locally in order to care for and minister to the local churches in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the churches everywhere are equal; there is no headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Bible we cannot find any headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is different from the Roman Catholic Church, which takes the Vatican as its headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is also different from Protestantism, in which various sects and denominations each have their own headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Bible the church did not have a headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the local churches, regardless of their size, were equal, autonomous in administration, living directly under Christ the Head, and directly responsible to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church in Jerusalem did not control the church in Samaria, nor did the church in Samaria control the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, in like manner, the church in Manila should not control the church in Hong Kong, nor should the church in Hong Kong control the church in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church in Manila should not control the church in Iloilo, nor should the church in Iloilo control the church in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the church in Manila is much bigger than the church in Iloilo, the two churches are both equally subject to Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the relationship among the churches in all the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The relationship between the local churches and the workers is related to a local church s being established and edified by a group of workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a local church is established and edified by a certain group of workers, it should recognize the spiritual authority of these workers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These apostles, or workers, have spiritual authority in relation to the churches that they establish and edify.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A proper local church will receive the authority of these workers and be led and edified by them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the relationship between the local churches and the workers.</S>
