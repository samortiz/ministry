 <h2 class="head2">The Second Level&mdash;<br />
the Ministry of the New Testament</h2>
<p>The second level of meaning of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the ministry of the New Testament. Second Corinthians 4:1 says, &ldquo;Therefore, having this ministry, as we received mercy.&rdquo; The Old Testament ministry is one of death and condemnation, since the Old Testament brings in condemnation and kills (Rom. 5:13, 18, 20, 21). The ministry of the teaching of the apostles brings in justification and gives life (Rom. 5:18). What we all have received is this unique ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Third Level&mdash;the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:11-12, Paul says that different gifted persons perfect the saints, unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the third level of meaning.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fourth Level&mdash;the Churches of God</h2>
<p>The Body of Christ is universal and the churches are expressed in different localities. This is the fourth level of meaning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING IN THE ONENESS OF THE FOUR LEVELS</h2>
<p>Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, our way, our service, our work, and our meetings are all based on these four levels. Furthermore, there is one teaching of the apostles, one ministry of the New Testament, one Body of Christ, and one church. This is the oneness of the four levels. Ephesians 4:4 says that the Body is one. Revelation 1 proves that the church in a locality is also one (v. 11); in each of the seven cities there was only one church (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today need to realize and be clear about this. If today we want to serve the Lord for our entire life, we need to serve in the teaching of the apostles, the New Testament ministry, the Body of Christ, and the churches of God.</p>
<p>The New Testament ministry is building the church of God and the local churches, that is, the Body of Christ today. Therefore, our work is the work of the New Testament ministry. We are not like some Christians who just do odd jobs. The work of the New Testament ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles. Therefore, we need to see that our service is in the oneness of the four levels, in the local churches, in the Body of Christ, in the New Testament ministry, and in the teaching of the apostles. Hence, our service cannot be two. It has to be one. The work we do is also one and cannot be more than one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING ACCORDING<br />
TO THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>If tens of thousands of saints in six continents are all doing the one work, who then is taking the lead? It is very mysterious to say that Christ is taking the lead. In practice, the real leader is the teaching of the apostles. We all must serve according to, follow, and be based on the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>Hymn #824 in <em>Hymns</em> says,</p>
<p class="hbody">The Church is Christ&rsquo;s own Body,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Father&rsquo;s dwelling-place,<br />
The gathering of the called ones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God blended with man&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>As far as the church being the gathering of the called ones is concerned, there should not be distinctions in who is on top and who is below, or who is high or who is low. But as far as the church being the Lord&rsquo;s Body is concerned, there is the difference between large and small members. One sees this in the human body where the shoulder is larger than the hand.</p>
<p>Today in the local church, we may not be too clear ourselves about what position we should take or what function we should have. But in the Body we become very clear: the hand knows where the foot is, and the nose also knows where the mouth is. Sometimes we may be the running feet. Other times we may be the working hand. Yet at another time we may be the listening ear. While our eyes may see clearly what others&rsquo; functions should be, we ourselves are often not too clear about ourselves. For instance, the sisters who live together in a &ldquo;kingdom house&rdquo; may not be too clear about whether they are older or younger than the others. You will be clear when you look at someone else. You know whether she is older or younger than you. It is best that we do not know too clearly. Whoever is older, I should accept her words. Whoever is younger, I should care for her. We need not ask ourselves whether we are hands or feet. Just as in a hospital, the treatment of ears, nose, and throat all belong to one department. As another illustration, take eight brothers and sisters in one family. You may not be clear about your rank among them, but you know who is the oldest, who is the second oldest and who is the youngest brother. Do not care which position you are in. If someone is older than I, I would receive supply from him; if he is younger than I, I would care for and guide him. This is what we need to see and learn.</p>
