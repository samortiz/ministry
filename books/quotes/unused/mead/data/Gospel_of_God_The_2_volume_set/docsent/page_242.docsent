   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The next verse says, "He who overcomes will inherit these things."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Who are these overcomers to whom John refers?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The overcomers here are different from the overcomers in the epistles to the seven churches at the beginning of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here, by the use of the term overcomers, a distinction is being made between the worldly people and the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The distinction here is not between one kind of Christian and another kind of Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The overcoming in the first three chapters of Revelation is the overcoming by some Christians among other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the overcoming in chapter twenty-one is the overcoming by the Christians among the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can we drink of the water of life?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who believe can drink.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to drink of the water of life freely, we have to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is faith that enables us to overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Compared to the worldly people, every Christian is an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But compared to other Christians, many Christians are failing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Compared to those in the world, we are all overcomers because we have a faith before God that the worldly people do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who overcome and those who drink of the water of life will inherit these things, and God will be God to them, and they will be sons to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapter twenty-two also mentions the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 1 through 5 say, "And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And there will no longer be a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His slaves will serve Him; and they will see His face, and His name will be on their forehead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And night will be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will shine upon them; and they will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The main thing in the New Jerusalem is the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This river proceeds from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because it is the river of life, there is the tree of life, with the fruit of life growing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Revelation 22, after everything has been said, one thing is prominent, the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This river of the water of life flows throughout the city.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can we enjoy the river of the water of life?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the end of Revelation, after the kingdom is over and after the church is over, verse 17 says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And let him who hears say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, everyone is welcomed into the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the new heaven and new earth there is a throne, and beneath the throne there is a river.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The river comes forth from God and has the throne as its source.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The throne is the center of the new heaven and new earth.</S>
