   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RESULT OF THE FAILURES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On their journey, the children of Israel had a number of failures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Numbers shows us that the result of those failures was death, not only of the common Israelites but also of Miriam 20:1 , Aaron 20:22-29 , and Moses 27:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Miriam, Aaron, and Moses were leaders among the people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Miriam was a prophetess, Aaron was the high priest, and Moses was the unique leader.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The result of their failures was death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This should be a warning to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should be careful concerning failures, because failures result in death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>X. FURTHER JOURNEYING A. The Hindrance of Edom</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the further journeying of the children of Israel, there was the hindrance of Edom 20:14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Edom consisted of the descendants of Esau, the brother of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The children of Israel were descendants of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, there was a close relationship between Israel and Edom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Numbers 20 Israel tried to get help from Edom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, Edom refused to offer help to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In typology, Israel may signify our spirit, and Edom may signify our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Israel's trying to get help from Edom signifies that we may sometimes try to help our spirit by depending on our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our flesh, however, will never help our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should be those who are in the spirit and who do not try to get help from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. Arriving at the Top of Pisgah</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, the children of Israel arrived at the top of Pisgah 21:10-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Pisgah was the mountain on which Moses was standing when he saw the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Passing by the Well of Beer</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On their journey to Pisgah, the children of Israel passed by the well of Beer, where Jehovah commanded Moses to gather the people together that He might give them water.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This well typifies Christ John 4:11-12 , and the water from this well typifies the Spirit John 4:13-14; 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Numbers 21, therefore, Christ is typified both by the bronze serpent and by the well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the bronze serpent Christ is for our replacement, and as the springing well He is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Israel Singing to the Well</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Numbers 21:17 and 18 Israel sang a song to the well: "Spring up, O well!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sing to it!/The well which the leaders dug,/Which the nobles of the people hollowed out/With the scepter and with their staves."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For a hymn on the spiritual significance of digging the well, see Hymns, #250.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to this song, the well was dug by the leaders and the nobles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those today who seek after the Spirit and take the lead to dig the well are noble and are leaders.</S>
