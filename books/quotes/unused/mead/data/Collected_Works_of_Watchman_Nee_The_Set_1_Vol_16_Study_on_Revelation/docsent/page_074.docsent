   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 20:7 22:5 I. SATAN'S LAST REBELLION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>REVELATION 20:7-9 A. Revelation 20:7-8</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their number is like that of the sand of the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What the prophets in the Old Testament saw was mainly concerning the time up to the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were not clear about what would happen after the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is spoken of here, however, is concerning those things which will happen after the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some may ask, "How can the people in the millennial kingdom still be so deceived after a thousand years?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must realize that during the millennial kingdom there will be two kinds of people on earth:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 The Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah 60:21 says, "Then all of your people will be righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 The good Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are the Gentiles spoken of in Matthew 25:34 through 40 and 46, who have treated God's elect kindly and are represented by the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They will enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The evil Gentiles will have been killed Rev 19:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although there are these two kinds of people in the millennial kingdom, the Jews have a much higher position than do the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These people are still human; they have flesh, and they continue to bear children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This first group of Gentiles that enter the kingdom are saved, but the children they bear may not necessarily be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isaiah 65:20 mentions death; thus, we can see that sin still exists at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Zechariah 14:17 indicates that there will still be some who do not want to worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 2:27 says that the Lord and the Christians will shepherd the nations with an iron rod.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, in the millennium, the people will be subdued by force.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If someone does not obey, he will be smitten to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If someone is evil, he will be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Satan comes, this group of people will be very susceptible to his deception.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. Revelation 20:9</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"And they went up upon the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city; and fire came down out of heaven and devoured them."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"The camp of the saints" is where the Christians live.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The beloved city" is the city where the Jews on earth live.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These people occupy the highest positions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people will attack the camp of the saints and the beloved city because of the temptation of jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The battle of Gog and Magog referred to in Ezekiel 38:2 is before the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One of these names refers to a person, and the other, to a place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The battle of Gog and Magog in Revelation 20:8 is after the millennium, and these names refer either to two people or two places.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Magog" is mentioned in Genesis 10:2, and "Gog" is seen in Numbers 24:7; "Agag" is translated "Gog" in the Septuagint.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the Arabian records, Gog and Magog occupied the area from Russia and Mongolia unto the eastern part of Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The people were nomadic and fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, some say that they are Mongolians, that is, Tartars.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their ancestors hated the Jews from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"The earth" refers to the Jewish land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Upon the breadth of the earth" means that their numbers are enough to fill the Jewish land.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"The camp of the saints" is where the believers live.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation 19:14 speaks of "the armies which are in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In heaven they are the heavenly armies; they are on earth only temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, it is a camp, and since a camp is not lasting, we see that the millennial kingdom will pass away.</S>
