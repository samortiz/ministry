<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF RECONCILIATION</h2>
<p>A very crucial point, the ministry of reconciliation, is found in 2 Corinthians 5:16-21. Reconciliation is in two steps. These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. The first veil is called the screen (Exo. 26:37, lit.). A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil (Exo. 26:31-35; Heb. 9:3) still separated him from God who is in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that he might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. First we were sinners in the outer court. After being reconciled, passing through the first veil, we became saved persons. From this time we became a new creation (v. 17). However, we may have continued to live in the natural life. At most we could only be in the Holy Place. The natural life in the flesh was still there separating us from the Holy of Holies. Therefore, we needed a second step, to be reconciled out of the natural life unto God.</p>
<p>In the first step of reconciliation, we were reconciled to God from sins. For this purpose Christ died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) that they might be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross to be judged by God upon Him for us. In the second step, we as believers living in the natural life were reconciled to God from the flesh of sin. For this purpose Christ died for us&mdash;the persons&mdash;that we may live to Him in the resurrection life. (2 Cor. 5:14-15). This is the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we may become the righteousness of God in Him. By the two aspects of His death He has fully reconciled God&rsquo;s chosen people to God. This is not simply to be justified by God, but to be made the righteousness of God in Christ. For Christ to become sin is higher than for Christ to bear our sins. Likewise, to be made the righteousness of God is deeper than justification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BETROTHED AS A PURE VIRGIN TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>There are a number of points in chapters six through ten, but these points should not be considered as crucial. In considering the crucial points in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, our standard is very high. When we use the Life-study Messages, it is not necessary to use every message and every part of the messages. When the messages were given as a study of a particular book, every verse was covered. However, we should focus on the crucial points in the central line of the book. These are the things which are neglected and overlooked by many of the saints.</p>
<p>In 11:2 Paul says, &ldquo;For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.&rdquo; Verse 4 says, &ldquo;For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different gospel, which you did not accept, you bear well with him.&rdquo; In verse 5 Paul referred to the super-apostles. Super-apostles is an ironic term. Besides Paul and his co-workers, there were others who taught differently. Paul considered that all those different teachings were replacements of the unique Husband. The unique Husband is Christ in His unique revelation. Other teachers came in pretending to be even higher than the apostles. However, Paul said that they were &ldquo;super,&rdquo; not higher, and that what they taught may become another husband to the Corinthians. To take their teachings is to take another husband.</p>
<p>The enemy is very subtle. Throughout the centuries many fundamental and scriptural teachings have been used by the enemy to replace Christ and the revelation concerning Christ. These teachings are more subtle than the Judaic teachings. The Judaic teachings of the Old Testament law and genealogy are not so fundamental as so many of the teachings given in past centuries, especially since the Reformation. Many good fundamental and spiritual teachings all became replacements for the proper revelation of Christ. According to Paul these are other husbands. When the super-apostles taught, they also used the name Jesus and the term gospel. Otherwise, Paul would not have referred to another Jesus and another gospel. This was very subtle. This point is very crucial and impresses us with a principle&mdash;anything that distracts people from the central line and from the focus of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, even though it may be quite fundamental and scriptural, is a replacement of Christ and of the revelation of Christ. If it is a replacement, it is another husband to us as the pure virgins.</p>
