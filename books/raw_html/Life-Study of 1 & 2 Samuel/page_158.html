<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Israel's Complaint over Judah<br>in the Bringing Back of David to His Kingship</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Israel's Claim</H2><P>The men of Israel asked David why the men of Judah had stolen him away and brought him and his household over the Jordan along with the men of David (v. 41). Israel also claimed that they had ten parts in the king and that in David they had more than Judah (v. 43a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Judah's Claim</H2><P>Judah claimed more prevailingly that David was near of kin to them and that they had not eaten at all at David's expense and that David had not given them any gift (vv. 42, 43b). The claims of Israel and Judah show that the whole people warmly welcomed David in his returning to his kingship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. THE REBELLION OF SHEBA</H2><P>Second Samuel 20:1-22 is concerned with the rebellion of Sheba.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Sheba, a Man of Belial,<br>a Benjaminite, Blowing the Trumpet</H2><P>Sheba, a man of Belial (2 Cor. 6:15), a Benjaminite, blew the trumpet and said, "We have no portion in David,/Nor do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse./Every man to his tents, O Israel!" (2 Sam. 20:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. All the Men of Israel<br>Leaving David and Following Sheba</H2><P>All the men of Israel left David and followed Sheba, but the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem (v. 2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. David Shutting Up the Ten Concubines<br>Defiled by His Son Absalom</H2><P>David shut up the ten concubines defiled by his son Absalom until their death (v. 3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. David's Charge to Amasa</H2><P>David charged Amasa to call the men of Judah to David in three days (v. 4). Amasa went out to call the men of Judah, but he delayed beyond the time that David appointed to him (v. 5).</P>
