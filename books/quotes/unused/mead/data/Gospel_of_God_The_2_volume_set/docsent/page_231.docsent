   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUFFETING THE BODY TO PLEASE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another passage which some misinterpret as referring to perdition actually refers to the losing of the kingdom and the losing of the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 9:23-27 says, "And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Run in this way, that you may lay hold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And everyone who contends, exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air; but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul feared that, having preached to others, he himself might be disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here Paul was saying that he could also be disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the meaning of being disapproved here?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And of what is one being disapproved?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In these messages, we have emphasized the fact that in reading the Bible, one should pay attention to the context.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we must also consider the context.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 24 Paul likens himself to one who is running in a race in which only one will get the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the problem here is not a matter of salvation, but a matter of receiving the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul is talking about how a saved one can receive the prize; he is not talking about how an unsaved one can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only the ones who are saved, who have believed in the Lord Jesus, who are reborn, and who have become the children of God are qualified to enter the race.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only the children of God can run in the race and pursue the prize that God intends for us to gain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If someone is not a child of God, he will not be qualified even to enter the race.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nowhere does the Bible say that salvation is gained by our running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible never says that if someone is able to run, he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If that were so, then very few could be saved, and salvation would be dependent on works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible says that the prize comes from the running; God has placed us on a racecourse for us to run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 25 says, "And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here it says that the prize is a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have mentioned that the crown signifies glory and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the word "disapproved" does not refer to the losing of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word "disapproved" means to fail to receive the crown and the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If Paul could be disapproved, then we all have the possibility of being disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If Paul had the possibility of losing his prize and losing his crown, then each one of us also has the possibility of losing the prize and the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 26 indicates the reason for being disapproved: "I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul had a purpose and a direction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was not beating the air.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His goal and direction were what he said in 2 Corinthians 5, that he was ambitious to be well-pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether he would live or die on this earth, his desire was to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How did he run in the race?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not run in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He had a definite direction and a definite goal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was not beating the air.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not simply do whatever others told him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nor did he do something simply because the need was there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If he were to work according to the need, he would have to run day and night, for the need was too great.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not for the work, but for pleasing the Lord.</S>
