   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"And the slander from those who call themselves Jews..."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Rev 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord not only knows the tribulations of His people and puts their tears into His bottle Psa 56:8 , He also knows the cruelty and slander of their persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result of their tribulations, His people have not tolerated evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have rejected the doctrine of those who have called themselves Jews but are not.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is true that there are many faithful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we should not think that because of this the church is at her golden age and that she is full of glory and void of failures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the Lord was fully sympathetic towards His suffering people, He pointed out the problem that everyone else did not see: "the slander from those who call themselves Jews."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Who call themselves Jews and are not."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This expression carries a few meanings:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 Those who are called Jews but are not are Jews according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the Jews according to flesh call themselves Jews, they are actually not Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are but Jews outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Inwardly they are not Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This undoubtedly corresponds to the apostle's word in Romans 2: "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly...But he is a Jew who is one inwardly" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are only Jews outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they were the real Jews, they would have believed in the Lord Jesus and would have become a part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Jews were the enemy of the church in Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first few centuries, the Jews were always linked with the persecutors of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a condition as it was in those days, where the descendants of Abraham joined hands with the unbelieving Gentiles to persecute the believers, was especially unbearable for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's holy Word was originally entrusted to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is easy for Satan to put a doubt in the believers' mind: "For hundreds of years they have been the chosen people for God's testimony, the kingdom from which the Messiah came.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they say that we are wrong, should we not doubt the position we are standing on?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2 But there is a more crucial meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These people are not only Jews in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If so, since these people are Jews already, why do they have to call themselves Jews again?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why did the Lord have to prove with such emphasis that they were not Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they were Jews, it was only right and proper for them to call themselves Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why did the Lord have to rebuke them?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would be meaningless for God to judge the church simply because they were Jews in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, there must be some deeper meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These people were counterfeit Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were actually Judaizers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord considered them people who called themselves Jews but were actually not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were the ones in the church who wanted to mingle Christianity with Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, they wanted to combine the Old Testament with the New Testament and to mix grace with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because this matter is crucially related to the whole church and to individual believers as well, we have to discuss its history in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the beginning, there were these Judaizers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They thought that those Gentiles who had believed in Christ should also keep the Mosaic law, be circumcised, and do other things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, these Judaizers had at the same time become the believers of Christ and the disciples of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This group of people can be traced from the history in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before Peter went to the house of Cornelius, and before he saw the vision of the great sheet, the Christians at that time still considered it an unlawful thing to preach to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although they were believers of Christ, they still kept the commandment in the law that forbids the eating of things common Acts 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While it is true that the Old Testament does teach this matter, they failed to realize that the age had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we read this chapter, we realize that without putting aside the law, there is no possibility for the Gentiles to believe in the Lord and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fact that the Gentiles have believed in the Lord and are saved proves that the law has lost its binding power in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Further on, we see how the Holy Spirit and the church 15:28 saw it good not to have the Gentile believers keep the laws of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That conference set the rule for the Gentile believers' walk throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Within a short time, the decision was made; the Gentile Christians no longer needed to be circumcised or keep the laws of Moses, as some believing Pharisees had demanded v. 5 . However, the tide of the age then was still for the ordinances of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Its influence on man was surprisingly great.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A person who understood God's way of grace as much as Peter did vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>7-11 would still falter in his walk on account of man and would be rebuked by Paul Gal 2:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, was not entirely clear in many areas at the beginning concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He may have done what he did for the sake of keeping peace, but he was not successful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He circumcised Timothy Acts 16:3 , he himself made a vow 18:18 , and he performed the ceremony of purification 21:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul did not need to do any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet because of the strong opposition of the time, he compromised to avoid trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The greatest persecutions of Paul came, on the one hand, from his countrymen the Jews according to flesh , and on the other hand, from the believing Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These were but the beginning of the work of the Judaizers in the church at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their poison, however, remains until today and has become even more serious; there is no sign of their going away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible is not lacking in warnings concerning the danger of the Judaistic teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The books of Galatians and Hebrews are written specifically to counter this error.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Judaistic teaching causes man to fall from grace and to underestimate Christ's accomplished work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, the apostle ranked the Judaizers who were of the concision with the dogs and the evil workers Phil 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If this teaching were not so dangerous, the Holy Spirit would not have inspired Paul to deal with these people so severely.</S>
