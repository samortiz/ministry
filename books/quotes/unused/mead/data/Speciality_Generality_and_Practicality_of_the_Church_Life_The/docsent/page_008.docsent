   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ATTITUDE OF THE WRITERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT TOWARD THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament we see the gifts, but we have to consider the whole New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the book of Acts we see that Paul was powerful in divine healing during his early ministry Acts 14:9-10; 19:11-12 though he did not stress it, but in his latter ministry when his spiritual son, Timothy, had stomach trouble, he only told him not to drink water, but to drink a little wine 1 Tim 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Also, Paul's intention in writing 1 Corinthians was to restrict the saints a little, or at least to adjust them, that they might use the tongues properly 1 Cor 14:6-11, 18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Ephesians, the book on the church, Paul does not say anything about the miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter four the gifts are persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul knew that the best way to build up the church was not with teachings, nor with the gifts, but by the Spirit with life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In all his latter books, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus, Paul didn't say a word about the miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, neither Peter nor John said anything in their books concerning the so-called Pentecostal gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul, Peter, and John were persons full of experience, yet none of them stressed the Pentecostal gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE WAY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way of life by the Spirit is the profitable way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It goes very slow, but it is steady and steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the long run, nothing can beat this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It goes on year after year, and it goes from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It also becomes stronger and stronger, and it gets more and more solid.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is slow, but for the long run it is the fastest way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is like raising an orchard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The trees being grown for the production of fruit grow quite slowly, but for the long run it is not slow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, the way of life by the Spirit produces something that nothing can shake or destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A FINAL WORD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not oppose anything that is genuinely of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The local churches must be all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, whether in teaching or practice, it is wise to use the things which are better.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we come to the generality and the practicality of the church life in the forthcoming chapters, this will become more and more clear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So many things are not within the circle of the speciality, our Christian faith, but in the realm of the practicality, which is for practice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>An example is pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We don't insist on pray-reading, because it is not an item of our Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But it is something for our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that by fellowshipping in this way we all will become clearer and clearer.</S>
