to Minister to the Others in the Meeting</h2>
<p>All of us should learn how to have something to minister to others. Every day in the morning we should read and pray-read two or three verses. Then during the day we can practice speaking these verses. We should learn to speak even if no one is with us. We can speak to the desk, the window, the table, and the entire creation. We need to speak again and again what we have read and pray-read in the morning. We must learn to speak. The more we learn to speak, the more we will have to speak. If we do not speak throughout the day, we will have nothing to speak when the meeting time comes. The time to prepare ourselves to speak is not merely right before the meeting. We must prepare ourselves throughout the day in the easy way by speaking the verses we read in the morning during the entire day. If this becomes our practice, we will have something stored within us when we come to the meeting.</p>
<p>You do not need to speak too long when you share in the meeting&mdash;about one to three minutes at most is sufficient. It is not sufficient for you to stand up and say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; and sit down. Occasionally this is acceptable, but not frequently. Learn to take the verses you have enjoyed in the morning as a base for your speaking. You do not need to memorize the verses. Just speak according to their content. I believe you will have something to speak if you put this into practice. Suppose the verses you have enjoyed in the morning are the first two verses of Matthew 1. Verse one says, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.&rdquo; If you would speak this verse during the day, you will have something when the time for the meeting comes in the evening. In the meeting you can say, &ldquo;Dear saints, our Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham. I love Him because He is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham.&rdquo; By doing this you have begun to learn how to speak in the meetings.</p>
<p>Try to practice this for four weeks and see how much improvement you will receive in speaking. If you speak well, some may appreciate it. Do not be proud of that. If you speak poorly, some may shake their heads. Do not be disappointed. When you are listening to others, on the other hand, learn not to overly appreciate anyone nor to despise anyone. Practice speaking together with all the saints. Through your practice you will become a different person, a useful person. Formerly you may have been dumb. Now you will be so bubbling. Formerly you had nothing to say. Now you will have much to overflow.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Psalm for Both Singing and Speaking</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 14:26, the saints may have five categories of items to minister to others in the meeting: a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. A saint may have a psalm for both singing and speaking in a Christ-filled spirit, not only to praise and thank God the Father but also to edify and build up the attendants. According to Ephesians 5:18-21, psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing but also for speaking. We should learn to speak the hymns. Hymn #501, &ldquo;O Glorious Christ, Savior Mine,&rdquo; is a wonderful hymn for singing and speaking. We should read and study this hymn and learn to speak it privately in our homes. Then we can come to the meeting and speak this hymn with others. This one hymn will become a marvelous message full of nourishment, revelation, and edification if we speak it properly. But we have to learn not merely to read but to speak. We have to sing or speak either a psalm, a hymn, or song in a Christ-filled spirit. We must come to the meeting with a spirit filled with Christ to praise and thank God the Father and to edify and build up the attendants.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
