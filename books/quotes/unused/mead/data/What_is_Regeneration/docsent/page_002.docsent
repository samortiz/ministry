   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BORN AGAIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regeneration also means to be born again or born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Originally we were born of our parents, but now we are born once more, this time of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible calls this experience being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were born of our parents, we obtained human life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we were born of God, we obtained God's divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A MATTER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regeneration is not self-improvement or better behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a rebirth which brings in a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is absolutely a matter of life, not a matter of doing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have already received the human life from our parents; now we need to receive the divine life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For us to have another life we must have another birth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we have the life of God, we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The life of God gives us the right and authority to become the sons of God John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this life we possess the divine nature of God, and have a life-relationship with God 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not need religious or ethical teachings to regulate and correct us; we need another life, the life of God, to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>WHY DO WE NEED TO BE REGENERATED?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because We Are Corrupted</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to be regenerated because of two conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From the negative side, we need to be regenerated because our life has been corrupted and has become evil, and cannot be improved from evil to good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"The heart is deceitful above all things / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jer 17:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Can the Cushite change his skin, / Or the leopard his spots?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>/ Then you also may be able to do good, / Who are accustomed to do evil" 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, nothing good dwells" Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because We Lack God's Life</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the positive side, however, we need to be regenerated because we do not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of all God's creation, man has the highest development of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No plant or animal has a higher life than man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet man, the highest created life, needs to receive another life for his completion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He needs the uncreated, eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Adam was created, he obtained only created life; he did not at that time obtain God's uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Likewise, when we were born of our parents, we obtained only the natural, created human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That birth gave us an entrance into the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But for us to enter the kingdom of God, we must have another birth from another source.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By our first birth we were born into the kingdom of darkness, but by our second birth we are transferred into the kingdom of the Son of His love Col 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's purpose is that we may obtain His own uncreated life and be transformed by this life into His image to be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if our human life had not been corrupted by the fall of man in Genesis 3, we would still need to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Genesis 1 and 2, Adam was without sin, yet he was void of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, God placed him before the tree of life that he might receive the life of God and be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's purpose in creating man is not merely to obtain a sinless man, but even more to have a God-man, one who has God's own life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>AN EXAMPLE OF REGENERATION NICODEMUS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 3 speaks of the new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It also contains a wonderful example of one who needed a new birth Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nicodemus was a person of excellent virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was a teacher with a high attainment in education.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a teacher of the Jews, he taught the Old Testament, the sacred Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nicodemus was a ruler of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He had a position of honor and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As an old man, he was full of experiences, and morally, he was an honest and good man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nicodemus was also a man who was truly seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although he was somewhat fearful of the Pharisees, he still came to the Lord Jesus by night.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This indicated that he was seeking God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nicodemus was an old man of perhaps sixty or seventy years of age, yet he came to see the Lord Jesus, who was only a little over thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This indicated his humility.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although he was a teacher, he addressed the Lord Jesus as Rabbi.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Among the Jews, to call a person Rabbi implies that you are humbling yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Could you find a better person than Nicodemus?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Surely he was a man of superior standard, great attainment, and high morality.</S>
