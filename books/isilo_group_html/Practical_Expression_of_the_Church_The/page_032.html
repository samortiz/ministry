Some may think that it is possible to have the church in the city and at the same time a church in the home.<p>In the New Testament epistles, only four homes are mentioned in which there were churches. In two of these places, it is the home of Aquila and Priscilla. The first is in Romans 16:5, &#8220;Likewise greet the church that is in their house.&#8221; This is the house of Aquila and Priscilla. At this time, they were living in Rome, and the church in Rome was meeting in their home. Therefore, the church in Rome could be called the church in their house. In fact, today in Sacramento, the church in Sacramento meets in the home of a certain brother. So we could say that there is a church in his house.<p>Then in Romans 16:10-11, two more houses are mentioned. But both of these verses do not mention a church. Romans 16:14 says, &#8220;the brethren which are with them.&#8221; They have the brethren, but it does not say that it was a church. And Romans 16:15 mentions, &#8220;all the saints which are with them.&#8221; But it also does not say that that was the church. It is just like the place that we call the Magnolia House, that we use today in Los Angeles. So many saints are living there, but we cannot say that is a church. At that time in Rome, there was only one house where there was a church, and that was the house of Aquila and Priscilla.<p>We must realize that the church in the home must be equal to the church in the city. There were not two churches in Rome, one called the church in Rome and another which met in the house of Aquila and Priscilla. The church in Rome simply met in the house of this couple; so there was a church in their house.<p>Then 1 Corinthians 16:19 says, &#8220;The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.&#8221; This again is the house of Aquila and Priscilla. Now this couple has moved from Rome to Ephesus. Acts 18:18-19 tells us this fact. So the church in Ephesus was meeting in their house. Wherever they were, this couple was so willing to have the meeting of the church in their house. In Acts 18, we see that Aquila and Priscilla traveled with the Apostle Paul from Rome to Ephesus. But after Paul left Ephesus, they remained there, and the church in Ephesus met in their home. This is why the Apostle Paul mentioned the church in their house.<p>Another church meeting in a home is mentioned in Colossians 4:15-16. Verse 15 says, &#8220;...the church which is in his house.&#8221; This is the house of Nymphas. If we read these verses carefully, we will see that the church in the house of Nymphas was the church in Laodicea. Verse 16 says, &#8220;And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.&#8221;<p>The church in the house of Nymphas was the church in Laodicea. This does not mean that there was a church in Laodicea and another church in the house of Nymphas. In Revelation 3:14, the church in Laodicea is mentioned as the only church in that city. This is the strongest proof that there were not two churches in Laodicea. There was only one church in this city, and that church was meeting in the house of Nymphas.<p>Now let us read Philemon 1-2. &#8220;Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, and to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and the church in thy house.&#8221; To understand these two verses regarding the church in the house of Philemon, we must read Colossians 4:9, 17: &#8220;With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you&#8221; (cf. Philemon verse 10). &#8220;And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it&#8221; (cf. Philemon verse 2). These two verses prove that Philemon lived in Colosse. The church in Colosse was meeting in his home. The church in his house was the church in Colosse.<p>The church in Rome was in the home of Aquila and Priscilla. And the church in Ephesus was also in the house of Aquila and Priscilla. Then the church in Laodicea was in the house of Nymphas, and the church in Colosse was in the house of Philemon. These are the four instances of a church meeting in a home in the New Testament.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practical Expression of the Church &nbsp; pg 32</div><br></body></html>
