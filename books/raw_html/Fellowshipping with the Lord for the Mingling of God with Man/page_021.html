        <h2 class="head1">THE SOUL BEING TRANSFORMED<br />
THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s work in us is in the principle of death and resurrection. Prior to our salvation, our spirit was dead, but through His death and resurrection, the Lord regenerated us and enlivened our spirit. Now our spirit has not only been enlivened, but our spirit is living because of, according to, and by the Spirit and the divine life. At the time of our regeneration, our deadened spirit was enlivened. However, our soul and our body still remained in their fallen condition. The work of God&rsquo;s salvation, thus, must reach our soul and our body. Hence, our soul and our body need to experience the Lord&rsquo;s death in order to be saved. Many portions in the Bible speak of the soul being put to death, such as, &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man [the soul] has been crucified with Him&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6); &ldquo;I [the soul] am crucified with Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20); &ldquo;Whoever loses it [his soul-life] will preserve it alive&rdquo; (Luke 17:33); &ldquo;Whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it&rdquo; (9:24); and &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself [lose his soul-life]&rdquo; (Matt. 16:24; Mark 8:34). These verses speak of the soul&rsquo;s experience of the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, John 12:24 says, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; <em>Dies</em> in this verse is equivalent to the word <em>loses</em> in the aforementioned verses. The dying of a grain of wheat is the death of its shell; the losing of the soul refers to the death of the soul. When our soul is put to death, the Spirit has the opportunity to work in us to enliven our soul by transforming it (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). Transformation in Romans 12 and 2 Corinthians 3 is not for our spirit, because our spirit received the life of God at the time of our salvation. The work of transformation after our salvation involves the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;the three parts of our soul. The transformation of our soul can be accomplished only through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>From the time of our regeneration until the time we are raptured, we must pass through three stages. At the time of our salvation our spirit was enlivened. Now that we are saved, our soul needs to be transformed. Finally, our body will be transfigured at the time of the rapture. Each stage in this process of transformation is according to the principle of death and resurrection. Romans 8:11 says, &ldquo;He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; This means that God will give life to our mortal body through the Spirit of life who is dwelling in our spirit. This word is fulfilled in us when the Spirit supplies our weak body with life so that we are empowered to serve God. The ultimate fulfillment of this word will be at the transfiguration of our body in the future. Although our body will die one day, it will be resurrected by the divine life. Death and resurrection are the principle by which God works in saving our soul. Our soul can be delivered only through death and resurrection. This also applies to our body.</p>
<p>The principle of death and resurrection implies transformation. After death and resurrection our soul is not annulled; rather, it is transformed. Transformation means that the element of God is added to our being. Formerly, our soul did not have God&rsquo;s element, but after experiencing death and resurrection, the divine element is added to our soul. In other words, transformation through death and resurrection brings our soul, which was previously unrelated to God, into God. As a result, our soul possesses the element of God. Hence, the principle of death and resurrection is to bring people who are outside of God completely into God by constituting them with the divine element. Our body is still outside of God. But it will be transfigured and brought into God when we are raptured in the future. At that time, our body will not only be intimately related to God; it will also contain His element.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIVE STEPS OF DEATH</h2>
<p>Our soul is transformed through the process of death and resurrection. Our soul-life must die in order for us to be transformed. Where there is death, there is resurrection, and there is also transformation. We experience death in the following ways.</p>
<p>First, our old man, our soul-life, was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6). This is of God. When the Lord died on the cross, the life of our soul was crucified with Him. Hence, objectively speaking, our soul-life was terminated on the cross when the Lord was crucified. We were crucified at the same time and in the same place that He was crucified. This is also when the Lord bore our sins on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24). This is an accomplished fact.</p>
<p>Our soul-life was crucified together with the Lord on the cross. This is an accomplished fact. Now the Holy Spirit gives us the revelation that we need to experience dying together with the Lord. This is the second step.</p>
<p>Third, based on the revelation that we receive, we can rise up to deny and to reject the soul-life. In our experience, we first see that we were crucified together with the Lord. Then we need to experience our being crucified together with the Lord. We must rise up to reject and to deny our soul-life, that is, to lose our soul-life. This step is not so easy to carry out. It requires the cooperation of our will.</p>
<p>Fourth, in coordination with our desire to lose our soul-life, the Holy Spirit arranges our environment in order to discipline us. If the Spirit does not work in our environment, it will be very difficult for us to lose our soul-life. Hence, God uses our outward environment to help us fulfill our inner desire of denying our soul-life.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Holy Spirit shines upon us to show us that in various matters we are still full of the element of our soul. This is a deeper shining of the Holy Spirit. These are the five steps of death that we experience.</p>
<p>As Christians, the lessons that we learn depend upon these five steps. Our growth and maturity in life also depend on these five steps. By experiencing these five steps, our problems will be solved. This is the way for us to lose our soul-life, for our old man to be crucified, and for us to deny our self.</p>

 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
