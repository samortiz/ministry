   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY SPIRIT CONVEYING THE LORD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE LORD HIMSELF TO US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we must see how the Holy Spirit conveys the work of the Lord to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord's work includes all that He has done on the cross, in His resurrection, in His ascension, in His second coming, and in everything that He bestows upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot go into detail concerning all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is too much to say about them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To speak of them, we would have to mention the work of the Holy Spirit in the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tonight we can only mention it in brief.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The coming of the Holy Spirit is not merely for conveying the Lord's work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is also for conveying the Lord Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The purpose of the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is to convey the Lord Jesus and His work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man has not received the work of the Lord, the Holy Spirit conveys this work to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a man has not received the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit conveys the Lord Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time we were saved, the work of the Holy Spirit was to convey the work of the Lord to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later His work is to convey the Lord Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ministry of the Holy Spirit is to manifest the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A week ago, two sisters came to me asking me how to translate the English phrase to minister with Christ into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a difficult phrase to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It means to serve others with Christ, like serving someone with a cup of tea or a bowl of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The work of the Holy Spirit is to serve the Lord Jesus to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we received the Lord, the Holy Spirit transferred the Lord's work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, all the work that the Lord has accomplished, such as the gift of repentance, forgiveness, cleansing, justification, sanctification, and joy, are accomplished by the Holy Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matters such as regeneration or the receiving of eternal life are accomplished in us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of the Holy Spirit is to convey the life of the Lord Jesus to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is similar to a wire conveying electricity from the power plant at Willow Tree Creek to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the Holy Spirit, we receive a new life, a new heart, and a new spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>36:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we receive a new spirit and a new heart, the Lord Jesus is able to abide in us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, regeneration is the Holy Spirit preparing a new temple for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since we are of the flesh, the Lord Jesus cannot dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are like the world under judgment at the time of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the water subsided, Noah released a dove from the ark Gen 8:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the dove found no place of rest; it could not abide anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same way, we are full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus can find no place to abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That being the case, God gave to us the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord accomplished everything objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now the Holy Spirit gave us a new spirit subjectively, so that the Son of God can abide in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Holy Spirit came first to prepare a dwelling for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the Lord came to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, the Holy Spirit gave us a new life within.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, day by day He conveys God's truth and purpose into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why the Lord says that when the Spirit of reality comes, He will guide us into all reality John 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, there is another item of the work of the Holy Spirit, which is to communicate to us the gifts, such as prophecy, tongues, healings, miracles, revelations, words of wisdom and words of knowledge, faith, and all kinds of other gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE HOLY SPIRIT PRESERVING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE ETERNAL FRESHNESS OF THE LORD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not want to enumerate in detail all the items of the Holy Spirit's work of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I will only stress one thing: all of the work of the Lord Jesus is conveyed to us today through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even the Lord Jesus Himself is conveyed to us through the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people do not understand the Holy Spirit's work of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They ask me how the Lord's work that was accomplished nineteen hundred years ago could be applied to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, if there were not the work of the Holy Spirit, their question would be fully justified.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can a work accomplished nineteen hundred years ago be applied to us today?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What the Lord accomplished nineteen hundred years ago was not left to "dry in the wind and the sun."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has preserved and nurtured this work in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That is why this work remains so fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today we can receive the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This work can be the same as it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once I went to a shop and the shopkeeper gave me a can of imported vegetable soup.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The can looked old and ugly outside.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was covered with dust.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The shopkeeper recommended it very much and was willing to sell it to me at a discount.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I bought it and took it home.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When I examined the date afterwards, I found out that the date was older than my age.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Later, when I opened it and cooked it, I found out that the soup was still quite palatable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the Lord Jesus' work were not preserved in the Holy Spirit, the question of time and space would come in. How could the Savior who died on Calvary nineteen hundred years ago come into me? But with the Holy Spirit, there is no question of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God has preserved the work of the Lord in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now the work of the Lord is living.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is why the Holy Spirit is able to convey the work of the Lord into us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have a brother who studies biochemistry.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He conducts experiments all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order to cultivate a certain bacteria, he has to use a certain kind of chemical.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As long as he maintains a certain temperature, the bacteria will live.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If the temperature becomes too high or too low, or if other elements are added into the culture, the bacteria will die.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The best environment to preserve the work of the Lord is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once the work of the Lord leaves the Holy Spirit, it will not be able to live and will die.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The same is true with the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A Christian life can never be separated from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If the truths understood by the Lord's children are separated from the Holy Spirit, they will gradually dry out and die.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Hence, all spiritual matters have to be in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Apart from the Holy Spirit, everything will die.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Nothing will survive.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to see that the Holy Spirit is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In Him is life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Apart from Him, everything is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Through the Holy Spirit, God conveys everything of Himself and the work of the Lord into us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God has prepared everything related to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Furthermore, the Holy Spirit has come and is ready to convey everything that God has prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If there is anyone who is not saved yet, he cannot say that God has not loved him, or that the Lord Jesus has not accomplished redemption for him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He cannot say that the word is too far from him and is unreachable.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>My friends, do you have a mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Some people may argue that they are dumb and that they do not have a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But they have a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They can be without a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But they cannot be without a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Romans 10:8-9 says, "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart...that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Because God has said that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Perhaps you wonder how it can be so simple and how it is that one can be saved just by calling.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is because the Holy Spirit has come.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He will save you as soon as you call.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>How does one call?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If he has a mouth, he can use his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If he does not have a mouth, he can call with his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This word is not far from us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is in our mouth and even in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This word is the word of justification by faith that we have been speaking of in the past few days.</S>
