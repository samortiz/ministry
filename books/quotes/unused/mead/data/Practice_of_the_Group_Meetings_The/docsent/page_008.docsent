   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE RAISING UP THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE GROUP MEETINGS BEGETTING AND RAISING NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way for the church to practice the God-ordained way to meet and to serve is first through the exercise of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel by preaching the gospel through visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must first bring people to be regenerated and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is to produce new believers by begetting them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we need to raise up group meetings to build up the new ones, to perfect them, and to raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To raise the new believers is harder than to beget them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All parents know that begetting a child is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the delivery of a child, a mother must feed her child several times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although this can be troublesome, it is not difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, to raise a child for over twenty years is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After being fed, a child begins to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, the child must be sent to kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, he must be sent to elementary school, junior high school, and high school.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At home also the parents must do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They must instruct, correct, and discipline the child.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They must also provide food, clothing, lodging, and many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Much has to be done in order to properly raise the child.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After more than twenty years, the child will graduate from college.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then he will be useful, not just for making a living but for doing things that can help his society.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Raising the new believers is the purpose of the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Acts 20 reveals Paul s heart and practice regarding the raising up of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He called for the elders from Ephesus to meet with him in Miletus, and he told them, Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears v. 31 . He said, I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house v. 20 . Paul exhorted and admonished the believers, both publicly in the big meetings and privately from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not shrink from telling them of all the things they needed to live their daily life according to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He told them all the things concerning God s counsel, the mysteries of God s economy, and he told them how to fulfill God s eternal plan concerning the mystery of God, Christ Col 2:2 , and the mystery of Christ, the church Eph 3:4, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Raising up the new believers in the way Paul did cannot be accomplished merely by the big meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even the home meetings for feeding the believers are not adequate to raise them up in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To raise up the believers in this way requires the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If only a few saints know the proper way to preach the gospel and have group meetings, they will be able to go anywhere and raise up new believers within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They will be desperate to get a few people saved and will then teach them in the way Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These new believers, who formerly might have been heathens who knew nothing about Christianity, will have a very good group meeting within a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many of us, however, came from the background of traditional Christianity, and it is not easy to change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if we practice the group meetings, we may not do it in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our oldness and staleness damages our practice of the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all are able to change, but whether or not we change depends upon our desperation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must not merely receive the speaking in these messages and appreciate and agree with all the points.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be desperate to have a radical change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without this desperation we will still have group meetings with spiritually old saints in the old way with the old concept.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be stirred up to have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We desperately need a new start and new group meetings.</S>
