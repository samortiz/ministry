However, I have met with you often before the throne. I would like to mention some matters briefly so that we may thank the Lord together! He has raised up faithful children in all the localities of Wenchow and P'ing Yang to truly take up a heavier cross and live a more difficult life for the Lord. There are a few brothers who once worked in the denominations. Now they stand alone by relying on the Lord for the sake of obeying the Lord. This is completely His work, and we thank the Father for this matter.</p><p>There is something in all the localities that causes us to worry. Many brothers and sisters have not really been revived! They have only moved out of the denominations. Nevertheless, we have already seen "a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand" arising! Therefore, we hope you will pray for this. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Ts'ai Ch'i</p><p>Some brothers who live by faith: P'an Huo Ling, 36 Beneath the Iron Well, Lan Hsing Temple, Wenchow; Lin Sheng Wu, P'u Men Horse Carriage Station.</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM THE JAN BROTHERS IN HANGCHOW REQUESTING TO LEAVE THE DENOMINATIONS</h2><p>Greetings to the Directors of the Sze Cheng Chapel:</p><p>Because we have seen that in the Bible there are no denominational differences and that it is a sin to have denominations, please remove our names from the Sze Cheng Chapel's Book of Life. This is not a matter of personal emotions but of obeying the teachings of the Bible. Since we have done this, we do not need to mention it again. When we meet, we are still friends. We have no other motives. That is all we have to say. We greet you. Peace in your way!</p><p>Sincerely,<br />Jan Ch'i Yu, Jan Feng T'ien<br />July 10</p><h2 class="head1">LETTERS FROM CHEN CHIA DISTRICT,<br />HUAI AN, NORTHERN KIANGSU</h2><h2 class="head2">One</h2><p>Greetings to the faithful bondslaves in the Lord,</p><p> our dear brothers, Mr. Watchman and Mr. Witness:</p><p>Thank the Lord for His love. Its depth is immeasurable. Even a worthless and evil servant like myself has been graciously called by the Lord! The Lord's table was established in my home more than two years ago. In the beginning, when we were laying the foundation, more than twenty people believed and were baptized. A few of them had never been in the denominations. The rest came out of the denominations. Then we did not increase again until June of this year when two sisters were baptized into the Lord's name. They were both more than seventy years of age. Recently, three or four more who are seeking the Lord and trust in Him have been added. We are still in a period of waiting. Last year two people went to sleep in the Lord. My wife was one of them. Before she died she said two sentences to me: "In the future, you do not have to stay in the house, you can go out to visit. On the Lord's Day come home." She shut her mouth and stopped breathing after these words. This proves she was saved. Our meeting place is less than two miles from a denominational gospel chapel. When the preacher of this group saw that we had left the denominations, he became contentious. He began to slander us before the people who went there to worship. He is very diligent in his labor of "sweat." Every Saturday he visits the homes of the worshippers to charge them to come worship on the next day. His diligent watchfulness shuts them in as tightly as the doors of the city of Jericho. We are really too immature. We can only drink milk and cannot take solid food, so our meetings are very low. I believe that God is almighty and a day of stirring up will come. If this were not true and He knew that I was cold, why would He grace me in the first place? I went to Shanghai in January to attend the Overcomers' Conference. I received both God's enlightenment and the brothers' help. During the conference, I first heard Mr. Lee speak on the living of a Christian. He said that toward the Gentiles we should be proper in everything, and we should keep our position in dealing with the brothers. Next I heard Mr. Nee say that if a Christian has not been sent, he should return to his own occupation. After the conference, I returned home. I prayed earnestly before God. I truly did not know what kind of occupation I should go into. I did not have the strength to be a farmer. I did not have the capital to open a shop. Thank the Lord, He opened the way for me. He enabled me to return to my old occupation of teaching. The school is in Hsu Chia Village about ten miles from my house. It is five miles from Ke Chia Village and seven miles from Chu Chia Kou. Although the supervisors are not brothers, they allow me to be free on the Lord's Day. At first I planned to rotate between these three localities on the Lord's Day. I did not know that I would feel a heavy burden once the Lord's Day came. So I still return home to meet every week. Although I walk twenty miles in one round trip, I am not tired. The glory for this should be given to the Lord Jehovah. He has made it more convenient for me to read the Bible at school than at home. In the early morning I read five Psalms. I read a few chapters of the Old Testament in the late morning and a few chapters of the New Testament in the afternoon. I have more than enough strength to do this and can also discuss the teachings with two or three students. There is no one to oppose. Now I would like to ask the brothers and sisters in every place to pray for us because the believers in Chen Chia Yu are mainly backsliders. Ask the Lord to revive the cold ones, uphold the weak, and free the oppressed. I also ask you, brother, to teach such a useless one as myself how to walk in the Lord's way. Moreover, I ask that you pray much before God because the locality of Chen Chia Yu lacks gifted members. Pray that the Lord would raise up priests to blow the horn before the ark of God while walking around the city of Jericho. I will write more details about the other matters in another letter. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Ju Ni<br />August 13, 1934</p><p>P.S. I am more than sixty years of age. I am not very talented, nor have I studied in depth. My eyes are going bad.
