None of them directly touches God's New Testament economy; none of them involves the divine dispensing or the divine mingling
Transportation, the means of traveling on the earth, has been improving steadily for nearly six thousand years
Such a dispensing and such a mingling are for the building up of the organic Body of Christ, which is composed of all the churches
There is no need to recover God Himself but among Christians the revelation concerning God has been lost missed put aside and even given up
The great theologians of the fourth and fifth centuries referred to the Three of the Trinity as three hypostases
The primary sense of the Greek word for hypostasis is something which stands underneath, that is, a support or a foundation
The word hypostasis, which was used in the theological writings that appeared in the Greek language, can also be translated substance
We should not understand this to mean that They are three separate persons according to the common understanding of the word person
The Father, as the origin, is the fountain; the Son, as the expression, is the spring; and the Spirit, as the transmission, is the flow
It is wrong to say that the Three of the divine Trinity are three separate Gods; that is the teaching of tritheism
The Father purposed , the Son accomplished what the Father had purposed , and the Spirit applies what the Son has accomplished
The Son came with the Father to accomplish redemption , and the Father was with the Son all the time while the Son was on the earth
When the Lord Jesus came to the earth to accomplish redemption, He came not only from the Father but also with the Father
These two things are evidence not only that the Son and the Father are one, but also that the Spirit is one with both the Father and the Son
In time, Christ as the Word of God became flesh to be a man and to tabernacle among men , full of grace and reality
Now, twenty-six years later, it is common to hear the saints in the Lord's recovery speak of Christ being the Spirit
Christ is the God-allotted portion of the believers as their life and life supply today and their glory in the future
Christ is resurrection, life, power, wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, and the reality of all positive things
Colossians 21617 says that eating drinking holidays the Sabbath and new moons all are shadows and that the body of these shadows is Christ
In 1 Corinthians 10:3-4, Christ is our spiritual food and our spiritual drink; He is also the spiritual rock that follows us
The Spirit is the Holy Spirit the Spirit of God the Spirit of Jesus the Spirit of Christ the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the Spirit of life
The word anointed is used by the apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 121 and the word anointing is used by the apostle John in 1 John 220 and 27
In Exodus 30 the Scofield Reference Bible has a note telling us that the compound ointment is a type of the Holy Spirit
It does not go on to tell us that this ointment is a compound with oil as the base and with another four spices as elements for compounding
In all of today's Christianity, it would be difficult to find one person who has any knowledge of these things
In Matthew 25:46, those among the nations who are judged by the Lord Jesus to be 'sheep' will enter into eternal life in the kingdom age
The eternal life is crucial for the producing of the believers and for the building up of the organic Body of Christ
Vincent, writing on Matthew 28:19, said, 'Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him'
It is carried out by the Spirit with the divine life, and it makes us, first, the children of God, and then, the members of Christ
The church is the church of God , chosen and predestinated by God the Father , redeemed by God the Son , and sealed by God the Spirit
The church is the counterpart of Christ, as Eve was to Adam , as His increase , a glorious church, holy and without blemish
The church exists universally as the unique universal church , but it is expressed locally as many local churches
The second element of the church ground is the unique ground of the locality in which a local church is established and exists
Briefly, the third element of the church ground is the reality of the Spirit, who is the living reality of the divine Trinity
The way to be saved out of all these divisive fellowships is to take and keep the unique, genuine, and proper ground of the church
Without the local churches, the Body of Christ has no way to exist and to carry out its function in practicality
The local churches, being the existence of the Body of Christ for its function, are the many expressions of the Body of Christ
A local church is one that exists in a locality as a city, the jurisdiction of the church being within the boundary of the city
Its administration under its eldership should, in everything, be carried out in the organic way, not by any organizational method
Without the building up of the local churches, by what other way could the Body of Christ be practically built up?
Among these items, the recovery of the proper ground of the church touches a major practical problem that we are facing today
In the past three years we have been facing a real problem among us, a problem that may be termed a rebellion, a turmoil, or a division
We have been enlightened to see that Christ has a Body and that we are members of His Body, that is, members of Christ Himself
In this Spirit there is divinity, that is, God's divine nature, and there is humanity, that is, man's human nature
There is also Christ's person, Christ's wonderful, all-inclusive death, and Christ's empowering resurrection with His ascension
Individually, we are members of the Body of Christ, and all the local churches are parts of this one unique Body of Christ
Since the Body of Christ is uniquely one universally, the fellowship of the Body of Christ also is uniquely one universally
The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the fellowship of the apostles the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God
1 John 1:3 tells us that the fellowship of the apostles is not merely with us, the believers, but also with the Father and the Son
The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the Body of Christ, the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God
By the Lord's mercy, today in the Lord's recovery we are under the apostles' teaching and in the apostles' fellowship
We need to see and have the boldness to say that we are in the fellowship of the recovery which is the recovered apostles' fellowship
When we see something going on in the recovery which is not so good, we need to have this kind of fellowship and a proper attitude
We have seen that the problems between Barnabas and Saul were probably due to a lack of proper and adequate fellowship
The circulation of blood in our physical body is a good picture of the fellowship, the flow of the divine life, in the Body of Christ
No part of my physical body can be separate from the other parts since all the parts must participate in the one blood circulation
The best way to stay healthy is to 'receive more blood and to give more blood,' that is, to stay in the fellowship, the circulation of life
Perhaps ten days from today, fifty brothers from fifty cities can go to a certain church to be in their Lord's Day morning meeting at 10 a
The circulation of blood within our body is like a river that always carries away the waste in our being so that it can be discharged
We need to see that it is not healthy or profitable in the Lord's recovery for anyone to have a boundary for his work
Any local church that does not keep this universal fellowship of the Body of Christ is divisive and becomes a local sect
Some so-called local churches are not genuine and have become divisions; we do not need to fellowship with such 'churches'
We should have fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ
We must receive all kinds of genuine believers, not according to anything of ourselves but according to Christ
A believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church that is the fellowship of the Body of Christ because of only three things
In dealing with the divisive ones we must also take Pauls word in Titus 310 A factious man after the first and second admonition refuse
To practice Paul's word in Romans 16:17 and in Titus 3:10 is to quarantine the divisive members in the Body of Christ
In 1 Timothy 13 Paul said that he had urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently
They do not believe that Christ is both God and man who came in the flesh to accomplish redemption for us, the sinners
The apostle John said that if such a one comes to us, we should not receive him into our home, and we should not even greet him
In his first Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul charged the church in Corinth to remove a sinful brother from the fellowship of the church
Jones, regardless of how nice, humble, and submissive she may be toward her husband, the base of her marriage will be annulled
Regarding one's condition, it is possible to pretend, but concerning the ground on which one stands, no one can pretend
We should not recommend any believer in the local churches to have any share in the meetings and activities of the divisions
The title 'the church of God' denotes not only that the church belongs to God, but also that the church must have the nature of God
The oneness of the Spirit is the oneness of the Body of Christ, which is the basic element of the unique ground of a local church
The unique ground the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, plus the unique ground of locality preserves a church from being divided
The condition of a certain church may be good, but that does not assure that the ground of that church is right
The condition of a local church can change and sometimes it does change but the ground of a local church should remain unchanged permanently
There is a difference between a denomination and a sect: a sect is not a denomination if it does not denominate itself
The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the entire Body universally, covering all kinds of genuine believers
Any bread on the Lord's table that does not signify the Lord's one universal Body but the body of a certain sect is divisive
Each time they made a strong announcement that whoever was not a member of that denomination had to leave the premises
The bread that they partook of was not a symbol of the Body of Christ; it was a symbol of the sect of that denomination
If we partake of such a divisive table without discernment, we participate in a division, which is condemned by the apostle
Some of the new believers among us may wonder what the difference is between the Lord's recovery and Christianity
We need to conduct ourselves properly, and we also need to exercise our discernment because of the confusion that is around us
