   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CRUCIAL POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CONTENTS OF THE HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To know the hymns we have to know some of the crucial points of the contents of the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we must know some of the hymns on the blessing and experience of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word blessing is used here not to refer to the good things the Triune God has given us but to the praise, the blessing, we offer to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An example of a good hymn on the blessing of the Triune God is #7 Glory, glory, to the Father! and an example of a good hymn on the experience of the Triune God is #608 What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also need to know hymns in the categories of the praise of the Father and the praise of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another crucial point of the contents of the hymns is the filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some have used the term the fullness of the Spirit, but we have seen from the Word that fullness is used for the expression of the riches of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is different from filling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible reveals that there are two aspects of the filling of the Spirit the inward filling for life and the outward filling for power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word pleroo refers to the inward filling and the Greek word pletho refers to the outward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We also need to know hymns concerning the identification with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I feel that identification is a better word than union.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not just united to be together with Christ, but we are actually one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A number of hymns in this section of our hymnal were written by A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of these deeper and excellent hymns written by A. B. Simpson cannot be found in today s hymnals of the Christian and Missionary Alliance churches, but we have included them in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The experience of Christ is another crucial point of the contents of the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hymn #499 Oh, what a life!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Oh, what a peace! and #501 O glorious Christ, Savior mine are excellent hymns in this category.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also need to know the hymns on the crucial points of the inner life, the church, the assurance of salvation, consecration, and comfort in trials.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hymn #720 is a good hymn in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first verse of this hymn and the chorus read:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God hath not promised skies always blue,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through;</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God hath not promised sun without rain,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But God hath promised strength for the day,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rest for the labor, light for the way,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Grace for the trials, help from above,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unfailing sympathy, undying love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also need to know the hymns on the crucial points of spiritual warfare, the gospel, the meetings, the hope of glory, and the ultimate manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hymn #948 and #949 are excellent hymns concerning Christ as the hope of glory, and #972 is a very good hymn on the ultimate manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hymn #949 was written to the tune of He Lives, He Lives :</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the hope of glory, my very life is He,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has regenerated and saturated me;</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He comes to change my body by His subduing might</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Like to His glorious body in glory bright!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He comes, He comes, Christ comes to glorify me!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My body He ll transfigure, like His own it then</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>will be.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He comes, He comes, redemption to apply!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As Hope of glory He will come, His saints to glorify.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE STANDARD OF THE HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can choose three hymns from our hymnal to illustrate what we mean by the standard of the hymns #70, #154, and #152.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These hymns are concerning our love for the Lord and His love for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The standard of hymn #70 Oh, how I love Jesus is very low in life, truth, experience, and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hymn #154 It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine is of a much higher standard.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first verse of this hymn says:</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My Savior, Jesus; yet this soul of mine</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Know more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hymn #152 O how deep and how far-reaching is of the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first verse of this hymn says:</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>O how deep and how far-reaching</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Is Thy love, dear Lord, to me!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Far beyond my pow r to fathom,</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Deeper than the deepest sea!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It has caused Thee death to suffer</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And to me Thyself impart,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That in Thee I might be grafted</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And become of Thee a part.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order to know the hymns, we must know the standard of the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some hymns are of a low standard, others are of a higher standard, and others are of the very highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A. B. Simpson s hymns on the identification with Christ are of the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hymn #481 is a very sweet song on being identified with Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verse 2 says:</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Tis not hard to die with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When His risen life we know;</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Tis not hard to share His suff rings</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When our hearts with joy o erflow.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In His resurrection power</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He has come to dwell in me,</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>And my heart is gladly going</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All the way to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do you feel that it is hard to die?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Here is a word that tells us it is not hard to die.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>To die with yourself is hard, but to die with Christ is not hard.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is not hard to die with Christ when His risen life we know.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This refers to Philippians 3:10 where Paul says, To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hymn #482 is another excellent hymn by A. B. Simpson on being identified with Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I especially appreciate the third stanza:</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This the secret nature hideth,</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Harvest grows from buried grain;</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A poor tree with better grafted,</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Richer, sweeter life doth gain.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We can compare these hymns by A. B. Simpson to hymn #1059, another hymn on knowing the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The first verse and the chorus say:</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Jesus, keep me near the cross,</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There a precious fountain,</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Free to all a healing stream,</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Flows from Calvary s mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In the cross, in the cross,</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Be my glory ever;</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>From the cross my ransomed soul</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Nothing then shall sever.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The chorus of this hymn indicates that the writer was referring to Galatians 6:14 But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The word boast may also be translated glory.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Thus, the hymn says, In the cross...be my glory ever.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Yet this hymn does not properly convey what Paul meant in Galatians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Paul gloried in the cross because of the circumcision exalted by the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The cross was really an abasement, but the apostle made it his boast.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He was glorying in the shame of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The most shameful death for a criminal was crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Circumcision foreshadowed the dealing with man s flesh; the cross is the reality of this dealing Col 2:11-12; Gal 5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The Judaizers endeavored to bring the Galatians back to the shadow; the Apostle Paul struggled to keep them in the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Circumcision was fulfilled by Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Thus, the apostle only boasted in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This truth in Galatians is not conveyed in hymn #1059.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This hymn was written before A. B. Simpson s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>At the time it was written, the revelation concerning the Lord s subjectiveness was not that deep.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is a good hymn, but it is obvious that the hymns by Brother Simpson are of a much higher standard.</S>
