<h2 class="head2">Swatow, Kwangtung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>For a long time we have been preserved in peace by the Lord. Two weeks ago I received a few letters from my sister in Bangkok urging me and Hwei-min to go there. There is no meeting in Thailand, and the two of us going there alone is a fearful thought. I do not know whether there are brothers and sisters in Thailand. If there are, please send us the address.</p><p>Sisters Chai Lan-jen and Hwang Hwei-min, June 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Presently, we do not know of anyone living in Thailand. If anyone knows of any, please inform us.)</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Recently, the broken dams on the Yellow River caused widespread catastrophe in a vast area. I wonder whether there are any brothers and sisters living in the disaster area. Hankow is now dispersing its population. I wonder whether there are brothers and sisters who have moved to other places. How are the meetings there? The political situation here is still very tense. More sisters have moved to the inland regions, but they are all safe, which is comforting.</p><p>Enclosed please find the X dollars which we received from the offering box. X dollars of this are for the pioneering work in the border regions, and X dollars are for relief to brothers and sisters in difficulty.</p><p>Brothers Chai Gi-chen, Chen Fang-ching, and Hsie Tse-shun<br />June 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</h2><p>The church here has experienced much of the Lord's grace. We see many people saved continuously. Many brothers and sisters have active, personal evangelistic work. After our first baptism, we had three more baptisms. Altogether twenty-five brothers and sisters have been baptized into the Lord's name. May all the glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Praise the Lord! He has saved a few instructors and students at the Aviation Institute through the brothers and sisters, and the saved ones have also been baptized into the Lord's name. Some of the baptized ones work in the hospitals, and some in the Telegraph Bureau.</p><p>K. H. Weigh, June 6</p><h2 class="head2">Ku-Jiu, Yunnan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brothers Weigh, Chen, and Lin:</p><p>God has cared so much for us humble specks of dust. At the crossroads of hopelessness, He caused us to turn suddenly into the way of life and light. Thank God that through the mouths of you three, I was brought to the understanding of the truth of regeneration. At the meeting on Tuesday afternoon, I testified to the saving power of Christ. Tonight, at the house of Mr. Fung of the Railway Department, I gathered together a group of friends, and we studied 1 Corinthians 13. I hope that every week we can have three special Bible studies together. But I am weak and powerless in myself. I hope that the brothers and sisters will pray for me. I pray that the Lord would bless all of them.</p><p>Brother Gung En-lung, April 24</p>
