   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE IN THE DEPTHS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hosea 14:5-7 reads, "I will be like the dew to Israel;/He will bud like the lily/And will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon./His shoots will go forth;/And his splendor will be like that of the olive tree,/And his fragrance, like that of the trees of Lebanon./Those who sit under his shade will return;/They will revive like grain/And will bud like the vine;/His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this passage, Lebanon is spoken of three times: once in relation to the lily, once in relation to the olive tree, and once in relation to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why is there such an emphasis on Lebanon?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is such an emphasis because the cedars on the mountain of Lebanon are very tall and the roots are very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible uses the cedars of Lebanon to represent the tallest and biggest trees on earth; they also signify people who strike their roots deep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this passage Lebanon is first spoken of with reference to the lily, then the olive tree, and finally the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the Bible to speak in this way is profoundly significant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us briefly consider these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why is the lily linked to Lebanon?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A lily is pure and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The lily that is referred to grows in the wilderness, not in a house garden.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No gardener cultivates this lily; it depends solely upon sunshine, rain, and dew for sustenance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christians are lilies of the valleys S.S. 2:1 ; we rely entirely upon God's cultivation and maintenance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A pure and beautiful spiritual life is derived from uninterrupted fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, "he will bud like the lily/And will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why is the olive tree linked to Lebanon?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the eyes of man, an olive tree has no splendor at all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we said that something has splendor like a peony plant, it would be easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But to compare splendor to an olive tree does not sound very appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the Bible shows us that splendor to God is not a superficial splendor but genuine fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The olive tree bears oil-yielding drupe its splendor is in its fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The splendor of a Christian is in the bearing of the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This can be achieved only by going inward and striking roots in the depths.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, his splendor is said to be as the olive tree and his fragrance as Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why is the vine linked to Lebanon?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The verse says, "They will...bud like the vine."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have we ever seen the budding of a vine?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Vine blossoms are tiny!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Very soon after budding, the buds are turned into grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We never see vine blossoms in a flower vase.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why does the verse not say that the budding is like that of the peach tree or the chrysanthemum?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is because the budding which God honors is not something for man's appreciation but something that bears fruit like the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God requires a Christian to strike roots and bear fruit abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is why the verse says that they shall bud like the vine and their renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lebanon is referred to three times all for the purpose of drawing attention to a life in the depths.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although this life in the depths is a secluded life like the lily in the valley , a life that is outwardly unattractive like the olive tree , and a life that is not prominent like the budding vine , it looks to God in simplicity and is capable of bearing much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the kind of life a Christian should have.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet it is impossible to have this kind of life unless one strikes deep roots; there has to be a regular daily exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must set aside a little time every day to pray and study God's Word reading and praying simultaneously in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If possible, we should also appropriate some time to pray for the saints, the churches, and God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a Christian does not read the Bible or pray every morning, he simply does not have any life in the depths.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To strike roots is not a matter of words but is an actual practice in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the beginning of this practice, one has to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May God's love attract and lead us into the depths day after day so that our roots may go down deeper and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to live a life in the depths, it is necessary to have direct and intimate fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Song of Songs 4:12 says, "A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse;/a spring shut up, a fountain sealed."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is spoken of here is a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the Bible, a garden is God's very first thought.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A garden is not an ordinary plot of land; it is not for general- purpose planting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Neither is it a field, which is specifically for tillage.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A garden exists solely for the purpose of beauty and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In a garden there may be trees, but their purpose is not for wood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There may be fruit trees, but their purpose is not for fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The importance of a garden is in its flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are planted only for their beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Flowers are for the pleasure of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The description of the garden as "inclosed" means that it is not a public park which everybody has access to for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, it is inclosed exclusively for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The inward beauty is to be seen and appreciated by Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This kind of life is not one that pleases men but one that only pleases Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This life is "a spring shut up."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The word "spring" can be translated "well."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A well is for man's use.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although this well is for man's use, it is still under the restriction of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This life is also "a fountain sealed."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A well is produced artificially, but a fountain is not.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A well is for man, but a fountain is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A fountain stands for the joy and contentment we acquire before God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We cannot consciously divulge our experience to men, because it is a sealed fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A Christian should not consciously exhibit his beauty, pursuit, and spiritual experience to others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything should be silently sealed up for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only this kind of life in the depths will satisfy the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers and sisters, our life is often too shallow, and a large portion of it is exposed on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May the Lord grant us grace and do a deeper work in us through the cross so that we may strike roots and have a life in the depths to fulfill God's requirements and satisfy His heart.</S>
