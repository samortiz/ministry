   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEWS OF THE CHURCHES A Letter from Brother Chou Shing-yi,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Greetings to X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My mother, sister, and I arrived safely in Shanghai from Mo-Gan-Shan on the tenth of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Tang Shou-ling, Brother Sun Wen-yuan, Sister Yu Siao-ke, Sister Yeh Chui-chung, and their families are temporarily staying on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The situation on the mountain can still be called peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is still food; however, it is not a place where one can live permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the Tang and Yeh families want to come back to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Sun and Yu families have not decided where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was originally going to travel with the brothers and sisters, but God gave me a clear leading and miraculously opened a way for me to come, so I came before Brother Tang and the others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this time of emergency, it is very difficult to get out of the war zone to a safe place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I thought that since God had opened a special way for me, I should go ahead and take it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If one family can leave, there is one less family to worry about.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Tang was hit by bandits in the chest with the handle of a rifle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The wound was very serious at the time, but thank God for His grace; it healed quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we have passed through many experiences in the past half year, including burning, robbery, plots, sickness, and dangers, we have clearly seen God's gracious doings in all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's presence, protection, and faithful promises and the power of His will were more real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I rejoice the most in the fact that I had an opportunity to absolutely seek God and to touch Him in all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was also able to quietly read His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In reality, this was God's answer to my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I had been praying to God for some time for a rest of six months to a year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We never stopped meeting during our time of fleeing the war.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Tang conducted a Bible study on Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He gave us much new light and showed us that the day of the Lord is pressing close.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I deeply believe that we passed through everything so safely because of the brothers' and sisters' prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, please continue to pray for the brothers and sisters left on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is almost impossible to send letters to Mo-Gan-Shan unless you find someone to take them for you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A few days after I came back to Shanghai, some people went there, so I gave them some money to take to the ones there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I will stay in Shanghai temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am considering where I will go next and will tell you when I am clear.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My mother and sister send their greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are very healthy now.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
