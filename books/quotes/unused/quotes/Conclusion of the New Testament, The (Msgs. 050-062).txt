Just as the good land was all things to the children of Israel, so Christ is our portion, our lot, our everything
In God's economy we have been put into this portion, and God has made this portion our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
In verse 24 the Lord goes on to say, 'God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality'
When we put these verses together, we see that the real worship of God is enjoying Him as our drink in our spirit
Many requirements were laid upon us, and it was impossible for us to fulfill them, for the price was too great
Although it is accurate to say that we are redeemed in Christ, this is not as delightful as saying that we are redeemed in the Beloved
We have been redeemed through the blood of God's Beloved shed for us on the cross, and now we may enjoy the Beloved as our Redeemer
In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul compares the believers at Corinth, and himself as well, to the children of Israel
He was born to be our Savior , and His name was called Jesus, meaning Jehovah our Savior, for He shall save His people from their sins
In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom; he says that Christ became wisdom to us
Paul composed verse 30 in the way he did in order to indicate to the believers that Christ should continually become wisdom to us from God
Christ as wisdom should unceasingly flow from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience
As we face certain problems and realize that we do not know how to handle them, we should apply Christ as our wisdom
If we remain with the Lord to receive His dispensing, He will be transmitted into us as the wisdom to handle various problems and matters
Wisdom in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is equal to the way in John 14:6, a verse where the Lord Jesus says, 'I am the way'
Day by day and hour by hour we should live in the spirit and exercise the spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ is the righteousness by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life
Of saying that the righteousness of Christ has become our righteousness, we should say that Christ Himself has become our righteousness
As believers we need not only to receive Christ as our righteousness objectively but also to live Him as righteousness subjectively
Whenever we enjoy Christ and experience Him, we have Him as our righteousness not only objectively but also subjectively
Because our life is our self and because Christ is our life, we may say that, in this sense, Christ has become us
If we experience Christ as our life, what we do in the church will not be done in a showy way but rather be done by a life hidden in God
As the One who is our redemption, Christ 'will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory'
The body of humiliation is our natural body, made of worthless dust and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death
The body of glory is the resurrected body, saturated with God's glory and transcendent over corruption and death
As the redemption of our body, Christ Himself is the element by which we shall be transfigured in our body to have His glorious likeness
After dying on the cross, the last Adam, our Redeemer, became in His resurrection the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life
When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, it was the life-giving Spirit who came into us
We may not realize that we have received the Lord Jesus not only as the Redeemer and the Savior but also as the life-giving Spirit
It would simply be an objective fact unrelated to life and would then be comparable to the resurrection of Lazarus
Resurrection was not merely an objective act accomplished by Christ, but is very much related to us subjectively
Corinthians unveils that the Christ who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we have been called is all-inclusive
As such an all-inclusive One, He is now the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all He is for our experience and enjoyment
In verse 6 we have the Spirit who gives life; in verse 17, the freeing, liberating, Spirit; and in verse 18, the transforming Spirit
Because Christ as the freeing Spirit is within us, we are free from the law, bondage, regulations, and dead letters
Christ as the life-giving Spirit is now doing a transforming work within us as He imparts Himself into us as life
We shall be transformed into His image from one stage of glory to another, until eventually we are the same as He
The glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is the glory of Christ as the resurrected and ascended One, the One who is both God and man
When we with an unveiled face behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done
The 'same image' indicates that we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is
As we receive this supply, it replaces the old element within us and causes it to be discharged and carried away
Christ is the door through which His believers may come out of any kind of fold and come into Him as the pasture
John 10:9 says, 'I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture'
By feeding on the pasture the sheep will enjoy the pasture as their abundant life supply, for the Lord Jesus is their abundant life
Christ had to die for the sheep in order to minister Himself as life to them and thereby be the pasture to them
Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd, Brought us right out of the fold Into His pasture so plenteous, Into His riches untold
In the divisions He sought us, Weary and famished for food; Into the good land He brought us, Oh, to our spirit how good!
Jesus Himself is our pasture, He is the food that we eat; We as His sheep are fed richly Each time, whenever we meet
In our daily Christian life we should have the definite realization that we are in the pasture enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life
As the Shepherd, Christ takes the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and to Himself as the pasture
In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus says of Himself, 'I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep'
Because Christ shepherds us by being life to us from within, the more we live by Him as our life, the more we enjoy His shepherding
As we are under Christ's shepherding, there will be a life consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life
The life within us, which is actually Christ Himself, will indicate that the Lord intends to lead us in a certain way
The Lord supplies His sheep with Himself as life so that there may be one flock and one Shepherd, one Body and one Head
As our Shepherd, Christ has brought us out of the fold into the flock, where we are in the pasture enjoying Him as our life and life supply
The Father is a husbandman, a farmer, cultivating the true vine, Christ, with its branches, the believers in Christ
No plant other than the vine tree can illustrate adequately the living relationship between the believers and Christ
Now as branches we are filled with Christ as life, for to be a branch in the vine means that Christ has become our life
Because we are branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us
The Greek word translated 'abide' means not only to remain in a certain place but also to dwell there, even to make our home there
There are countless aspects of the riches of Christ, for He is the reality of every positive thing in the universe
Because all positive things signify Christ, when He was on earth He could use so many things as illustrations of Himself
As believers, we need to know and experience the unsearchable riches of Christ, which are for the producing of the church as His expression
The very fullness of the Godhead has become the unsearchable riches of Christ to be dispensed into us for our experience and enjoyment
It is significant that Paul's word concerning the unsearchable riches of Christ is found in the book of Ephesians
If we are to know the real significance of these unsearchable riches, we need to consider the context of the whole book of Ephesians
According to 4:8, when Christ ascended to the height, 'He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men'
The heading up of all things in Christ is according to Gods eternal dispensation according to Gods economy His administrative arrangement
The economy or dispensation which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times
Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth
It is crucial for us to realize that the Christ who is our portion for our enjoyment is the Christ with unsearchable riches
Through His death He took away our sins, dealt with our sinful nature and with the old man, and destroyed the Devil
In particular, according to the book of Ephesians, through His death Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances
We need to know these riches and experience them by considering all the profound matters revealed in the book of Ephesians
We all should be able to testify that only Christ satisfies us and that daily we are strengthened, sustained, and satisfied by Him
The Christ who is subjective to us, to whom we are joined and with whom we are one spirit, is our spiritual food
In verse 33 Christ refers to Himself as the bread of God, who came down out of heaven and gives life to the world
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
The spiritual drink here refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock , which typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink
Although eating and drinking are very common in our daily living, in the Bible they are matters of crucial significance
As we eat and drink certain elements, those elements are taken into us and become one with us in substance and essence
Having been born of God by receiving the Word, we have the divine life, eternal life, and this life becomes the light shining within us
When we receive Him as the expression of God, He becomes our life, and this life becomes the light that shines within us
Because the way is a living person, the Son, so the place must also be a living person, God the Father Himself
Christ is not the way to bring the believers into heaven; He is the way to bring the believers into the Father
When we get into Christ as the way, we arrive at the Father as our destination, because the Son is one with the Father
Christ has taken away sin, He has judged the world, He has destroyed Satan, and He has terminated the old creation
We experience the fact that God is in us and that we are one with Him, and then God becomes our enjoyment through the divine dispensing
If we call on a name other than the name of the Lord Jesus, we shall not have a way into God, because all other names are void of reality
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately on the way into God because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God
Because the Son is the embodiment of the Father, when we call on the name of the Lord we have both the Son and the Father
According to Colossians 3:4, when Christ our life is manifested, we also shall be manifested with Him in glory
Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know certain things, the first of which is the hope of God's calling
Christ is not only our Savior; He is also our hope to bring us into the full blessing and enjoyment of eternal life
God has ordained that we should be brought into this glory , and, as believers, we have been called into this glory
The Christ who was God's expression, the effulgence of God's glory , now dwells within us to be our hope of glory
Just as we hope for the blossoming of a seed that has been sown, so we hope for the blossoming of the life of glory that is now within us
Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles
The very Christ who has removed through His redemptive death the separation between the Jews and the Gentiles is now our peace
The peace Christ gives overcomes all troubles and fears, especially those caused by the persecution of religion
Because the disciples were under the fear of the opposing and persecuting religion, the Lord told them that in Him they had peace
No matter what opposition and persecution we may face, the Lord Jesus within us is our peace, and we may enjoy Him as peace
For us to be branches of the divine vine and to bear fruit to express the divine life is a matter of joy-a joyful life
When we are one in the Father's name by the Father's life, enjoying the Father together, we shall have the Lord's joy made full in us
He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself nor expecting to gain something for Himself
All the aforementioned items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come
The word 'feast' in verse 16 refers to the annual Jewish festivals, signifying joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction
Just as the new moon marked a new beginning in Old Testament times, so Christ affords us a new beginning with light in darkness today
According to Colossians 216 and 17 Christ is the reality of the various aspects of the ceremonial law which are shadows of spiritual things
The armor in Ephesians 6 is not for the believers as individuals; it is for the church corporately as the Body
We need to put on Christ as the whole armor of God so that we 'may be able to stand against the stratagems of the Devil'
Truth here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and expressed by us as our living
Because Paul's daily living was conformed to the pattern of Christ, he had the strength to face all opposition and adverse circumstances
Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the breastplate of righteousness, which covers our conscience, signified by the breast
No matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we still need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness
The girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and the firm foundation of the gospel of peace are all Christ
Christ is God expressed and revealed, Christ is the righteous element that covers us, and Christ is the peace that enables us to stand
If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we shall spontaneously have faith
We come now to the very important and vital matter of Christ being the One who lives within the believers so that they may live Him
As the ascended Lord He is sitting in the heavens at the right hand of God, and as the life-giving Spirit He lives within us
On the one hand, we are terminated; on the other hand, we continue to exist, but we do not exist without Christ
Now that He dwells in us as the Spirit, we need to learn how to let Him live in us and how to live together with Him
Sooner or later, those who seek the Lord realize that Someone divine, heavenly, eternal, and spiritual lives in them as a person
If we see this, we shall also see that just as He lived because of the Father, we should now live because of Him, taking Him as our person
The books of Galatians and Philippians indicate that Paul was a person who practiced living Christ in all the small things
According to the book of Galatians, Christ has been revealed in us , He is now living in us , and He will be formed in us
Christ was born into us at our conversion, now He lives in us in our Christian life, and He will be formed in us at our maturity
Our Christ today is the One who lives in us and also the One who is being formed in our being by constituting us of His divine element
Our heart is composed of the three parts of our soul-the mind, the emotion, and the will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit
When Christ makes His home in our hearts, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself
Although Christ is vast, extensive, and immeasurable, in the eyes of the imperial guards of Caesar Christ was virtually nonexistent
Paul magnified Christ; he made Him great before the eyes of others, especially before the eyes of those who guarded him in prison
As a result, through Paul's magnification of Christ even some in Caesar's household turned to Christ and were saved
As Paul was held captive in a Roman prison, he magnified Christ, making Him appear great in the eyes of his captors
Such an expression was a declaration of the unlimited greatness of Christ, a declaration that Christ is inexhaustible
There is a crucial difference between natural human virtues and those virtues that are the magnification of Christ
Even though Paul must have been mistreated in prison, he could display to the guards the unlimited greatness of Christ
He was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure
If we would experience Christ as the empowering One we need to let Him live in us be formed in us make His home in us and be magnified in us
It is the converse of the Lord's word concerning our organic relationship with Him in John 15:5, 'Apart from Me you can do nothing'
The 'all things' in Philippians 4:13 refer to the things mentioned in verse 12 and the virtues listed in verse 8
By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life and be true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of
That man was made in the image of God means that he was made in the form of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Because of the shining in our hearts, we have this treasure, a treasure that is wonderful, precious, and marvelous
God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything
Now this treasure has become the source of the power energizing us and enabling us to shine forth God's glory and to manifest the truth
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
Christ is the center of God's economy, the portion given to us by God for our enjoyment and the mysterious wisdom hidden in God
What is deeper than the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit and our being joined to the Lord as one spirit?
In order to know Christ as the depths of God, we need to know that through incarnation God one day became a man named Jesus
Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us
We shall realize that we are in the very heart, the depths, of the almighty God, and that He is becoming our inner element
Because our experience is limited, we are not able to explain adequately what it means for Christ to be the depths of God
Peter 2:21 says, 'Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps'
Literally, the Greek word means a writing-copy, an under-writing for students to use in tracing letters as they learn to draw them
The Lord Jesus has set His life before us as an underwriting for us to copy by tracing and following His steps
Outwardly Christ is our model, and inwardly He is our person, living in us, being formed in us, and making His home in us
We need to become Christ's reproduction, copies of Christ, by experiencing a process that involves the riches of the divine life
To illustrate, a man may set an example for a monkey to stand upright, and the monkey stands up, imitating the man
We need Christ as the Author of faith, because, according to our natural man, we do not have any believing ability
When we look away unto Jesus, He, as the life-giving Spirit, dispenses Himself into us as the believing element
He transfuses us with Himself, working Himself into us, until He, the very person, becomes the believing element within us
When we look away unto Him, we give Him the opportunity to work Himself into every inward part of our being until we are saturated with Him
As believers, we all need to experience faith in such a subjective way by looking away unto Christ, the Author and Perfecter of our faith
It was necessary for Him to be perfected through suffering before He could become to the believers the Captain of salvation
The writer of Hebrews advises them to go on to reach God's New Testament goal to enter into the veil, that is, to enter the Holy of Holies
For this, Christ has taken the lead, as a Forerunner, to enter into the veil that the believers may follow Him
God sent Christ to us as the Apostle to share God with us so that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness
We should forget our environment, weaknesses, troubles, and even ourselves and remember that Christ is our High Priest ministering to us
He also wore the breastplate in which were set twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel
His attainment is so high that He has entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and has been crowned with glory and honor
Hebrews 4:15 indicates that, as our High Priest, Christ has been tried in all respects like us but without sin
As the One who has been tried in all respects like us, our High Priest, Christ, is able to sympathize with our weaknesses
For Him to be divine is a matter of constituent, a matter of His having the necessary, basic element that constitutes Him our High Priest
Christ's divinity constitutes Him a High Priest who is living and full of life so that He may be able to continue His priesthood perpetually
Having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ is fully equipped and qualified to be our High Priest
Christ has not been constituted the High Priest according to the law of letters but according to the power of an indestructible life
The Greek word translated 'uttermost' also means completely, entirely, perfectly, for all time and eternity and to the end
Hebrews 7:25 indicates that Christ is able to save us to the uttermost because He is always living to intercede for us
He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose
He intercedes for us constantly, knowing how easy it is for us to fall and, once we have fallen, to remain in our fallen state
Hebrews 7:26 says, 'Such a High Priest befits us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens'
As the One who is holy, guileless, undefiled, and separated from sinners, Christ is the perfect One, and He surely befits us
The word of John the Baptist in John 3:29 indicates that to the believers Christ is the Bridegroom: 'He who has the bride is the bridegroom'
Now this One is in the heavens submitting Himself to God's headship for the carrying out of the divine administration
All have been born of the same Lord regardless of the way in which they have been baptized, of the food they eat, or the days they observe
We should realize that He is our Lord and that we are not qualified and do not have the position to make decisions
If we know that Christ is our Lord, and the Lord of all believers, we shall honor Him by praying and waiting on Him for His leading
We the believers should not only recognize Christ as the Lord; we should take Him as our Lord, more personally and more intimately
Paul's word concerning the relationship between slaves and masters reveals that Christ is the believers' Master, Lord
Because the branches are the Lord's friends, they can know the Father's desire to be expressed, glorified, in a corporate Body
We have been predestinated by God to be conformed to the image of the Son so that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers
Christ, the believers' Brother, is the model and pattern for all His brothers, who will be conformed to His image
These many brothers are the propagation of the Father's life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life
Because Christ and the believers are of the same source and have the same life with the same nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers
In God's economy Christ is God's appointed One to accomplish God's plan, and we are Christ's partners in the divine interest
God the Spirit poured Himself out as the anointing oil upon this appointed One, anointing Him to be the accomplisher of God's operation
The Greek word for 'partners' here as in 1:9, is metochos, the same word for 'partakers' in Hebrews 3:1; 6:4; and 12:8
In those three places it means that we share in the heavenly calling the Holy Spirit and the discipline therefore we use the word partakers
We are partakers of heavenly, holy, and spiritual things, sharing in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the spiritual discipline
Joshua entered into the land of Canaan, and Caleb was his comrade, companion, and partner in entering into and possessing this good land
After we have enjoyed Him in this way, in our experience He becomes the Captain who takes the lead, and we follow Him as His partners
The Lord's word in Matthew 9:12 reveals that He is our Physician: 'Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill'
The judgment of a judge is according to righteousness, whereas the healing of a physician is according to mercy and grace
He came to minister as a physician to heal recover enliven and save them so that they might be reconstituted to be the members of His Body
Although the Lord may or may not heal us in our body, He is always ready to heal us in every part of our spirit and soul
Paul's experience in his later ministry helps us to have a proper appreciation of Christ as the believers' Physician
It may appear to some that in caring for Timothy's ailment and Trophimus' sickness in a human way Paul acted as if he were an unbeliever
Paul's experience should help us to see that, for the most part, Christ's healing today is for the spirit and the soul
We may have the assurance to sacrifice everything for Him and for the church life without worrying about our living
Roman Catholicism claims that 'the rock' here refers to Peter, whereas most fundamental Christians say that it refers to Christ
The church that is built upon the rock of Christ and the revelation concerning Christ is the genuine church, and it is not sectarian
Any group that is built upon doctrines, practices, or concepts is not the church built upon Christ and the revelation concerning Christ
As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church
When they were declaring that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, they were saying that these were their foundation and standing
The unique foundation is not Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or any one or anything other than Jesus Christ, the Son of God
According to 1 Corinthians 1:2 and 9, Christ is our common portion, and we have been called into the fellowship of Christ
Among the vast majority of Christians today, there is no governing, restraining vision of Christ as the unique foundation
From this we see that we need to understand 1 Corinthians 3:11 not merely in a doctrinal way but in a way that is very practical
Just as in ones physical body the head and the body are one so Christ the Head and the church His Body are joined and therefore are one
All that Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained as the Head is not only for the Body but also to the Body
Colossians 1:18 says, 'He is the Head of the Body, the church; who is the beginning, Firstborn from among the dead'
The fact that Christ is the Firstborn from among the dead indicates that He is the Head of the Body in resurrection
Ephesians 1 indicates that after His resurrection and ascension, Christ was made the Head over all things to the church
Because Christ is the Head of the Body, we need to hold the Head so that the Body may grow with the growth of God
Now in the church life we enjoy not only God, the Redeemer, and the life-giving Spirit but also the Christ who is the Body
There cannot be circumcision, those who observe Jewish religious rituals, and uncircumcision, those who do not care for Jewish religion
No matter what kind of person we may be, as far as the new man is concerned, we must regard ourselves as nobodies
The Bible does say that in the new man there is no place for the natural person, because Christ is all the members
In sanctifying the church, Christ first washes away our sins with His blood and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life
Sanctification does not mean merely to be separated from what is common; it also means to have the very element of Christ added to us
The Christ who is the Cleanser is not the objective Christ in the heavens but the subjective Christ the Christ who is intimate and available
On the one hand, we have the addition of Christ, but, on the other hand, we have the subtraction of the natural disposition
The vine absorbs the riches from the soil and the water, digests them, and then transmits them to the branches
If we would be nourished by Christ, we need to abide in Him to absorb His content into our being as life and life supply
If we continually take in the spiritual supply, the elements we absorb into our being will cleanse us inwardly
Through Christ's nourishment we are transformed and thereby become a new person with a new element and substance
Just as a mother cherishes a child by holding the child to her breast, so the Lord cherishes us by holding us close to Him
When we are in this atmosphere we experience the rest, warmth, comfort, and encouragement that come from Christ's cherishing of the church
The fact that Christ is 'clothed with a garment reaching to the feet' proves that He is a Priest, for this garment is a priestly robe
He no longer needs to offer the sacrifices, but He does need to dress the lampstands by filling them with oil and snuffing the burned wick
Revelation 116 says He had in His right hand seven stars and as verse 20 makes clear the seven stars are messengers of the seven churches
At the time the book of Revelation was written, the offices in the churches had deteriorated in the degradation of the church
He delivered Himself to death, but death had no way to detain Him; instead, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it
Because Christ is the One in the church who is the Holder of the keys of death and Hades, death and Hades should not have any power over us
In Revelation 1:18 the Lord says that He is the living One, that He became dead, and that He is now living forever and ever
He is the One by whom and with whom the church can be holy, separated from the world, and true, faithful, to God
To fulfill His eternal purpose God must accomplish two categories of work: the work of creation and the work of building
God's creation is for His building, and God's building is the ultimate consummation which fulfills His purpose in creation
At the beginning of the Bible we have a garden indicating God's creation and at the end of the Bible a city indicating God's building
Peter 24 speaks of Christ as a living stone To whom coming a living stone having been rejected by men but with God chosen held in honor
At regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growth in us transforms us into living stones
In this process our natural life is replaced by Christ, and Christ becomes us, thereby making us the precious materials for God's building
In the New Jerusalem there will not be any clay, for all the clay will have been transformed into precious stone
As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for His building
Nothing and no one other than He are qualified to be the foundation of the divine building in the universe according to Gods eternal economy
God's intention in saving us is not to bring us into the heavens; rather, it is to join us to the Jews so that He may have His building
In this message we come to the last aspect of what Christ is in His person-Christ in the divine administration
Apparently the earth is ruled by kings and presidents; actually the Lord Jesus rules the whole earth through the earthly authorities
His throne is like the fiery flame and its wheels as burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him
Revelation 1:15 says that, as the Judge of the churches, Christ has feet that are 'like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace'
Now the feet of Christ are as shining brass, signifying that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise the divine judgment
Speaking to the church in Pergamos, the Lord says in verse 12: 'These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword'
The Lord's eyes search the inward parts and the heart, and His feet judge and give to everyone according to his works
John heard these words: 'Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals'
As the Lion, Christ has defeated the rebellious Satan, and as the Lamb, He has taken away the sin of fallen man
Because the Lamb will supply God's redeemed with waters of life for their satisfaction, they will have no tears of dissatisfaction
The book of Revelation is a book of judgment, and Revelation 8:3-5 unveils Christ as the Executor of God's judgment
In the administration of God's judgment on earth, Christ is the Angel standing in the position of One who has been sent by God
Verse 4 says that 'the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God'
For Christ to place His feet on the sea and on the land is to tread on them, and this means that He takes possession of them
Only He is worthy to open the scroll of God's New Testament economy, and only He is qualified to possess the earth
Verse 1 says, 'I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory'
She has become a dwelling place of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird'
In Revelation 14:8 an angel said, 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great,' and in 18:2 Christ cries out with the same words
In 18:2 Christ declares judgment over material Babylon, not religious Babylon, for this city is ugly and abominable in the sight of God
At the judgment seat Christ will judge His believers not concerning their eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward
While we are still in the body we should do things through it to please the Lord so that we may be rewarded by the Lord at His coming
The fire is the fire of the Lord's judgment , which will cause each believer's work to be manifest and will try and test his work
It will tell Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the entire universe that God is sovereign and that no one can rebel against Him
Revelation 19:16 tells us, 'He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords'
The fact that this name will be written upon Christ's garment and thigh indicates that it will be openly revealed and known to all
He has been designated by God to execute this judgment, and God's raising Him from among the dead is strong proof of this
In the coming age and eternity Christ will be the Ruler over all the peoples on the earth in the divine administration
As described in Revelation 20:11-15, Christ will judge the dead at the great white throne after the millennium
Him' is the Lord Jesus, for God the Father has given all judgment to the Son and has ordained Him to be the Judge of the living and the dead
These books are the records of the works, the deeds, of the unbelievers, according to which they will be judged
Revelation 20:15 says, 'If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire'
The Lord Jesus possesses both the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues
Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence, He possesses the divine nature with the divine attributes
In the Lord Jesus man and God, God and man, are mingled to form a composition full of the divine attributes and the human virtues
With Him the divine attributes filled the human virtues, and the human virtues contained the divine attributes
With Christ the divine attributes are in the human virtues, and the human virtues contain the divine attributes
Possessing the divine nature and the human nature, He lived a life on earth with the attributes of God expressed in the virtues of man
Today the Christ who lives in us is still the One who possesses the human virtues strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes
From the time of His resurrection He has been seeking to live in the believers the kind of life He lived on earth
Man crowned Him with thorns to shame Him , but God crowned Him with glory to show forth the splendor of His person in God's glory
The Lord Jesus participates in the divine glory, not separately by Himself, but along with the Father, for He and the Father are one
Before His incarnation, Christ as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father
His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him
The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord's humanity
Christ's divine element was confined in His humanity much as God's shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle
As the Lord lived, walked, and worked among the people, His disciples saw in Him something that had never been seen by men before
The crowds were astounded at His teaching, for He was teaching them as One having authority, and not as their scribes'
John 17:2 says, 'You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him'
Corinthians 12:9 says, 'He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness
For this reason, Paul would most gladly boast in his weakness, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him
The Greek word translated 'tabernacle' in 2 Corinthians 12:9 is episkenoo, a compound verb composed of epi and skenoo
It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weakness
Our conformity to His death affords a base for the power of His resurrection to rise up so that His divine life may be expressed in us
Revelation 5:12 says that Christ the Lamb is worthy to receive riches, and Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ
Because Christ's riches are unsearchable, untraceable, all the positive things in the universe point to Christ
The church is produced not by teaching nor by organizing but by the dispensing of the riches of Christ into us
Grace is mainly not the work the Lord Jesus does for us grace is the Triune God in Christ dispensed into us and experienced as our enjoyment
In brief, grace is Christ as the embodiment of God experienced and enjoyed by us through the divine dispensing
The love of God the Father is the source, the fount; and the grace of Christ is the flow, the expression, of love
Grace is actually the Triune God embodied in Christ and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our enjoyment
We have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit as the full enjoyment of the Triune God
He is easily touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and quickly enters into a fellow suffering with us in our weaknesses
He knows how to be merciful to man, for He is a man with the experience of human life, the experience of human suffering
We may even say that He is more than like us because He suffered in His human life certain things that we have not suffered
According to our natural condition, we are eligible only to receive the Lord's mercy, a mercy that reaches down to our pitiful condition
Even now, although we are saved, we are still, in some ways, in a condition that needs the Lord's mercy to reach us
We need to receive it by exercising our spirit to contact our High Priest who sympathizes with us in all our weaknesses
When the preposition epi is added to other Greek words as a prefix, it often bears the meaning of full or extensive
It includes love, kindness, mercy, peacefulness, mildness, gentleness, reasonableness, the ability to fit in, and many other virtues
He drew near, went with them, and said to them, 'What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking'?
They proceeded to tell Him about Jesus of Nazareth a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people and who was crucified
How forbearing the Lord Jesus was to listen to the disciples speak things that He knew much better than they did!
After walking quite a distance, 'they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther
When He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, 'their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him'
He has the growth in life, the satisfaction in life, and the contentment of life required to have the virtue of forbearance
He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself nor expecting to gain something for Himself
When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men
He emptied Himself by putting aside the form, the outward expression, of His deity and becoming in the likeness of men
Philippians 2:8 also speaks of Christ's obedience, saying that He became 'obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross'
We may have the desire to be faithful in keeping our word, but we may lack the ability, the means, to fulfill it
From what Paul says in Romans we may think that the righteousness of God is one thing and that the righteousness of Christ is another
Here Peter combines these two kinds of righteousness when he speaks of the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ
His righteous act on the cross fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners
Jesus Christ certainly is the right One, the One who is right, and only this right One can be our Advocate with the Father
Only the Lord Jesus can be called the Righteous One, because only He is right with God and with everyone and with everything
Speaking of Christ, the last part of Luke 1:35 says, 'The holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God'
As the conceiving of the Lord Jesus was of the Holy Spirit so what was born of that conception was a holy thing something intrinsically holy
In Hebrews 725 Matthew 92830 Philippians 321 Hebrews 218 Revelation 535 and 61 the attribute of Christs ability is fully shown
