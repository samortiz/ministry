   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>While I was seeking to know the Bible in a thorough way, there appeared in my hometown a Christian periodical entitled The Morning Star.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I obtained and read all available issues of that paper.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As I read, I frequently noticed articles under the by-line of Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was obvious that those articles were the most outstanding ones on biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were the best in the whole paper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more I read them, the more I enjoyed reading them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the way this writer addressed his readers, I imagined he was an aged Christian teacher, perhaps over sixty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, he was a young man only two years older than I. Then an issue of the paper was published with a notice saying that Watchman Nee would publish his own paper, to be entitled The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Immediately, I subscribed to this magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From 1925 through 1927 I received all twenty-four copies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When one issue would come, I would devour the whole thing in the same day if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Besides reading The Christian, I purchased all the books he published on the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From these I received the greatest help in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I greatly appreciated and highly treasured this magazine and these books.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the same time, I was led to read Watchman Nee's article in The Lamp unto My Feet, a periodical published by the Newton Brethren in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This article also deeply impressed me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During these days I began to correspond with Watchman, and this initiated our first contact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I wrote, asking him questions about the Bible, all of which he answered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In one letter I asked him for advice concerning the best book on understanding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He answered that to his knowledge, the book which could be of most help in knowing the Bible was John Nelson Darby's Synopsis of the Books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He added that unless I read it four or five times I would not be able to understand it well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eight years later, while I was staying as his guest in Shanghai, he gave me this set of books as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After being saved, I still attended the Sunday morning services in the Chinese Independent Church for about two and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But through the reading of Watchman Nee's writings, I began to realize that the denominations were wrong and that there was such a thing as a proper church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Though inwardly I was through with the denominations, yet I still remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In that denomination there was a young man who realized that I was different from others in seeking after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day he asked, "How can we know that we are saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Taking the opportunity to help him with the assurance of salvation, I handed him a book on the subject by Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After reading it, he became clear and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His name was Du Chung-chin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A relationship developed between the two of us, and that relationship was likened by our pastor to the one which existed between Joshua and Caleb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later this brother was transferred by his business to Shanghai, and I encouraged him to attend a meeting where Watchman Nee was ministering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Seven years later he became one of the first three elders of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the end of 1927, the Chinese Independent Church elected me to be a member of their board.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was an unusual distinction for such a young man as me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But I was forced at that time to tell them that I could not accept the position and would remain in their denomination no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I rather asked them to remove my name from their "book of life."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Henceforth, I began to meet regularly with the Brethren Assembly, attending all their seven weekly meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I sat among them, earnestly absorbing all the doctrines they taught.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I remained with them until 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While I was still with them, I was baptized by immersion in the sea by their leader, Mr. Burnet, in 1930.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One day in August 1931, as I was walking down the street, the thought suddenly occurred to me that all the teachings I had received in the Brethren Assembly were mostly doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I considered how much knowledge I had accumulated and yet how dead I was.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>True, I never returned to the world, yet, though I attended seven meetings a week, I was utterly cold and fruitless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At this time I experienced a deep and real repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The next morning at an early hour I climbed to the top of a small mountain near my home.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I cried to the Lord and wept in desperation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Morning by morning I went there to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From that day on I cared little about talking; I only wanted to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This experience lasted for several months, from August until February or March of the following year.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During the time I was seeking the Lord, in September 1931, Watchman was about to have his second overcomer conference in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time I corresponded with him and enrolled as one of the attendants in that conference.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But because of the Japanese invasion into Manchuria, close to the province of Shantung, I was prohibited from attending that conference.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the spring of 1932, Brother Du Chung-chin returned to Chefoo from Shanghai and came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He told me of all the good meetings and all the good things of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This made me all the more eager to travel to Shanghai and partake of the blessings there with the saints.</S>
