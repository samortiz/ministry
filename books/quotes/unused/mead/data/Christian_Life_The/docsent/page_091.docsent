   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN LIVING AND WALKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UNDER THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:24-26; Gal 5:24; Rom 6:6; 8:13b</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we covered the matters of being regenerated crucified and of dying to live.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The term regenerated crucified may seem strange, because the two words regenerate and crucify have opposite denotations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if we are regenerated, we are crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our first birth there was no crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In that birth we were born to live.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in our second birth, that is, in regeneration, we were born crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have been born, or regenerated, crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After being regenerated crucified, we continue to die.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After our baptism, every day we should live a dying life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a life is a continuation of our baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not forget that we are dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only so, we should not forget that we are even buried persons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are dead and we are buried.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After our baptism we are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every day we are dead persons, and now we live by dying.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the phrase regenerated crucified and dying to live the conjunction and conjoins regenerated and dying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are regenerated, and we are dying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have been regenerated crucified, and now we need to die that we may live.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After our baptism we live by dying and we die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Dying to live is the proper meaning of bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From my youth I heard the teaching concerning bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This teaching was based on the Lord's word in Matthew 16:24: "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the understanding of many Christians concerning bearing the cross is not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to their understanding, to bear the cross is to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this wrong understanding I wrote a hymn Hymns, #622 concerning the meaning of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first stanza of that hymn says:</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we take up the cross, will we but suffer pain?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nay, if we bear the cross, be sure that we will die!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The meaning of the cross is that we may be slain;</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The cross experienced the self will crucify.</S>
