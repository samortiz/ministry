<h2 class="head1">GOING THROUGH<br />
THE GATEWAY OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>How should we consecrate ourselves? It is very simple. We need to bring our position, our work, our family, and our all to God, handing them over completely to Him through prayer. When we go before the Lord in this way and yield ourselves to Him, the Lord will bear the responsibility, not us. This is consecration.</p>
<p>The Lord has led me through such an experience of consecration. One morning I felt strongly that I had to pray. While I was praying, the Lord showed me that I needed to go through the gateway of consecration. Kneeling before the Lord, I confessed my sins and then handed over my ability and my speaking to Him. I also offered my wife to Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, You have given my wife to me; I hand her over to You.&rdquo; I also offered my children, one by one, to Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, they are Your children; I hand them over to You. Furthermore, I hand over everything else that I have, including my furniture and my clothing to You.&rdquo; We should hand ourselves over to the Lord in a detailed way.</p>
<p>If we are willing to have such a consecration before the Lord, we will enjoy all that He has. We must hand over everything we have, both within and without, to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STANDING IN THE POSITION OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>After going through the gateway of consecration, we need to stand in the position of consecration by faith. Consecration does not mean that the circumstances of our living will change. For example, our children and our spouses may still trouble us. In such situations, however, we need to stand in the position of consecration by faith. The devil seeks to frustrate man&rsquo;s salvation in two ways. First, he hinders man from being saved, and second, he causes believers to be skeptical and full of doubt. Before a person is saved, the devil tries to prevent him from being saved, but after a person is saved, the devil tries to make him doubt his salvation. Likewise, before a believer consecrates himself, the devil tries to hinder him from consecrating himself to the Lord, but after a believer consecrates himself, the devil tries to make him doubt his consecration. This is the devil&rsquo;s cunning scheme.</p>
<p>When a brother, who was a farmer, went to work in his field, he was reminded of his need to consecrate himself to the Lord. Therefore, he prayed, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I consecrate everything to You.&rdquo; Shortly thereafter, a question from the devil entered his mind, asking, &ldquo;Have you truly consecrated yourself?&rdquo; The farmer began to have some doubts, and he said to himself, &ldquo;Just in case, I will consecrate myself again.&rdquo; So he prayed, &ldquo;Lord, I give everything to You. I give You my house, my field, and everything I have.&rdquo; After he worked for a period of time, the same question again came to him: &ldquo;Have you really consecrated yourself?&rdquo; When he began to have some doubt, he realized the scheme of the devil. In response, he inserted a wooden stake into his field so that he would be able to point to the place of his consecration. He said to himself, &ldquo;If the devil comes again, I will show him the evidence of my consecration.&rdquo; After a short while, the devil again asked, &ldquo;Have you truly consecrated yourself?&rdquo; The farmer quickly responded, &ldquo;Go away! I have consecrated myself to the Lord, and this stake is the place of my consecration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we offer ourselves to God, He is pleased to accept us. We have no cause for doubt. When we place ourselves on the altar, our offering of ourselves is counted by God. We should have no uncertainty about our consecration or about the Lord&rsquo;s acceptance of our consecration. There was once a brother who had nothing to give to the Lord. He was in poor health, and his situation showed no signs of improvement. When many of the brothers began to consecrate themselves to the Lord and were full of rejoicing, he was concerned that he had nothing to offer to the Lord. The only thing he could think of to offer to the Lord was his wife, who loved the Lord very much. Even though he was afraid that the Lord would call her for His work, he still offered her to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I have nothing to give you, but I offer my wife to You.&rdquo; In his mind this consecration was merely a polite gesture to the Lord; he fully expected that the Lord would not accept his offering. Little did he know that the Lord truly wanted his wife to work for Him. When the brother learned of this, he was very disappointed. He later testified, saying, &ldquo;I was merely trying to be polite to the Lord when I consecrated my wife to Him. Little did I know that He would not be polite in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once we consecrate ourselves, we are in the position of consecration. We must see that this position is crucial. Once we stand in such a position, we should not be afraid of anything. The devil is afraid of our consecration, and he is happy as long as we do not stand in the position of consecration. We need to say to the Lord, &ldquo;You are the Lord; You should gain everything that I have.&rdquo; This word will not only touch God&rsquo;s heart but also scare the devil away.</p>
<p>A sister who was serving as a missionary was traveling on a boat that encountered some pirates on the sea. She prayed and received a word: &ldquo;I belong to Jesus.&rdquo; When the pirates came to her, she courageously said, &ldquo;I belong to Jesus. You cannot harm me unless Jesus wants you to harm me.&rdquo; This word scared them, and they were fearful of harming her. One of the pirates, however, noticed that she was wearing a watch, and he demanded that she give him the watch. She spoke to the pirate in a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;I cannot give my watch to you. I cannot give my watch to a pirate. If you want it, you will have to use force to take it because I will not give it to you.&rdquo; The pirate then forcefully took the watch. When the leader of the pirates heard about this incident, he returned the watch to her. At this point she spoke to the leader, saying, &ldquo;Look at the dirty deck. Are you not concerned about sickness? You should clean the deck.&rdquo; Because of her speaking, the pirates cleaned the deck. She did not suffer any harm, and she was able to grasp the opportunity to preach the gospel to them.</p>
<p>To stand in the place of consecration means to let the Lord be the Lord, allowing Him to control everything. After consecrating your child to the Lord, you should ask the child, &ldquo;Whose child are you?&rdquo; Surely he will say, &ldquo;You are my father, and I am your child.&rdquo; Then you have to say, &ldquo;Formerly, you belonged to me, but you are no longer mine.&rdquo; The child might say, &ldquo;If I no longer belong to you, I still belong to my mother.&rdquo; you have to tell him, &ldquo;You no longer belong to your mother either. We have consecrated you to the Lord; now you belong to Him.&rdquo; Then when your child makes a mistake, you will have the ground to show him the Lord&rsquo;s interest in the matter, which will give the Lord the opportunity to work in your child&rsquo;s situation. Many people rise up in the morning and pray to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Today I consecrate everything to You.&rdquo; But when their children make a mistake, they quickly act as if their children belong to them, saying, &ldquo;We are your parents. We told you not to do bad things. Since you did not listen to us, we are going to punish you.&rdquo; Parents who act in this way chase the Lord away and give Him no opportunity to be the Lord.</p>
