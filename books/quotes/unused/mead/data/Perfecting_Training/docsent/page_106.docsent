   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider the verses concerning the law of sin and of death in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 21 reads, I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul found a law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was not the law of God given through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a law just like the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I throw something into the air, I don t need to pray that God would send it back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It comes back because of the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, if you drop a book, and it falls to the earth, you shouldn t condemn Satan, saying that he took away your book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That is not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That means you do not know the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also need to read verse 20: But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul discovered that what he did not want to do, he did.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then he said it was no longer he that did it but something within him that did it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He said that it was sin dwelling in him that did it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He discovered that there was a law working within him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he wanted to do good, a law came in to frustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 22 Paul said that he delighted in the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This refers to the law given on Mount Sinai through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This law was outside of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 23 goes on to say, But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive in the law of sin which is in my members.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Mosaic law was outside of Paul, but another law was within him warring against the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This law was in his members, in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It goes on to say that this law is warring against the law of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law in the mind is another law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not the Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a law in your mind, in your very nature created by God, always trying to do good, to keep the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mind represents the soul, and the soul is the being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that in the living part of your being is another law which wants to keep the law of God and to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the law in our members is always warring against this good law in our mind and making us captive to the law of sin which is in our members.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This one verse makes it very clear that the sin in our members is the law of sin in our members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can we prove that the law of sin in our members is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must go back to read verse 18: For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to do the good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This proves that the law of sin in our members is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is sin personified and in verse 21 is also called evil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He says that evil is present with him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that in the whole universe what is evil is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And this evil is the very sin that is in our members, that is, in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>AN EVIL SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us also read Romans 5:12.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The world here means mankind, human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through Adam, sin entered.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means something living entered into human beings, into mankind, into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This something living must be that evil one, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Genesis 3 the Devil tempted Adam and Eve to take the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time Satan entered into man and that entered Satan is nothing less than Satan himself becoming a system in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That system within us, that set up principle within us is called the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>AN EVIL INSTALLATION</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that at the fall of man Satan entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words Satan has installed himself into man as an evil electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Satan has installed himself into man as an evil system.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That system, that set up principle, is the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From that time onward, when man wanted to steal, to commit fornication, to kill people, he didn t need to do it by activity but by law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No human being needs to be taught to steal or to commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That evil law in you simply works.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one needs to be taught to be selfish or to be covetous or to be greedy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not a matter of an activity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is simply the law of the greedy lust.</S>
