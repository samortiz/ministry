   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CHRIST IS THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:19, 20, 23; 15:4-5; Gal 2:20a; Eph 3:16-17; Phil 1:20b-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to impress us again with the five wonderful statements mentioned in the first chapter which specifically express the burden of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, man is the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, Christ is the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, the church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fourth, the church life is the real communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fifth, go therefore and disciple all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>GOD'S NEED FOR US AND OUR NEED FOR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this chapter my burden is to share with you that God needs us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God needs man, and man needs Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without man, God cannot fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without man, God can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, we also have to say, "Without Christ, I can do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without us, God can do nothing, and without Christ, we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God needs us, and we need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are here for God, and Christ is here for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we were not for God and if we did not have Christ for us, we would be miserable and pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Unfortunately, this is the real situation of today's world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The people in the world are not for God and they do not have Christ for them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They just go along by themselves and by trusting themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we Christians are different in that we are for God and we have Christ for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you have a genuine realization that you are for God and that you have Christ for you?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you really do, you will be on fire, and you will go and tell people this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We said in the preceding chapters that God has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's purpose is to express Himself and also to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To carry out His twofold purpose, God needs man to be His expression and to subdue His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But how can man do this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Humanly speaking, we may be incapable of doing many things, but all of us can breathe, drink, and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even the little babes know how to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need for anyone to teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the same manner, we are incapable in the spiritual realm, but we can breathe in Christ John 20:22 , drink Christ 4:14; 7:37 , and take Christ in as our food 6:35, 51, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the air, the breath; Christ is the water, the drink; and Christ is the bread, the food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we all can take Christ in. God has no intention for us to express Himself by ourselves or to do anything for Him by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's intention is that we express Him and do things for Him by taking Christ as our life Col 3:4; John 6:57; 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are two big mistakes one made by the worldly people and the other by the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The big mistake of the worldly people is that they do nothing for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Christians, on the other hand, try to do something for God by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This also is a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The right way for us is to do something for God, not by ourselves but by taking Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus said, "Apart from Me you can do nothing" John 15:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet the apostle Paul said, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me" Phil 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without Christ, we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But with Christ and in Christ, we are able to do all things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In John 14:20 the Lord told the disciples, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, we are not without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have Christ and we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In today's human society, there is nothing except vanity and misery because people are on the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They have nothing to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Christians, however, are trying to do something for God by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now, at the end of this age, the Lord is going to recover something mainly through the younger generation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, you young people all have to learn how to be for God by taking Christ as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If I ask you what you are doing here, you should not say that you are here studying or working.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, you have to say, "I am here in Southern California for God!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What are the young people doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are here for God!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By what way?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By taking Christ as their life!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means they are breathing Christ, drinking Christ, and eating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without us, God can do nothing, and without Christ, we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are vessels for God who need to take Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How wonderful it is that we are good for taking Christ as our life!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The animals were not created for taking Christ but we were.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all are qualified to take Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you truly realize this, you will go out to tell people that they are good and qualified for taking Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ is our life Col 3:4 , and the eternal life is nothing less than Christ Himself John 3:15-16, 36; 14:6a .</S>
