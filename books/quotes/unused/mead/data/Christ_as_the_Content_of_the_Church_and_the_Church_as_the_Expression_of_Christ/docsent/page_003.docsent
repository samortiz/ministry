   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING THE PURE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to stress that since Christ is the life, content, and everything to the church, the church must be purely the expression of Christ, not of anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church should not be the expression of any teaching or gift but just the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why there is not much teaching in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we were asked to write something about the church, we might write a long book with many chapters of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But Ephesians is a book on the church of only six chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because the church is the expression of Christ not of Christ in doctrine, but of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why the miraculous gifts are not mentioned in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, what is seen are the living person of Christ and His living Body with His living members.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even the gift of teaching is not mentioned in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have the Teacher, not the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to realize that the Teacher is different from the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Body of Christ, His living members express Christ and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Body is the fullness of Christ as the One who fills all in all Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ must be the very fullness within us, settling down within us to make His home in us as our everything by occupying, saturating, and permeating our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the church becomes a pure expression of Christ and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to see this vision clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many so-called churches today give people the impression of healing, teaching, or speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These gifts become a replacement of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you come among some Christians, you may have the impression that they are very dogmatic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are always determining the difference between wrong doctrine and right doctrine, giving others the impression that they are for a certain kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is all wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must give people the impression that we are for nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When people come to our meetings, they must have the impression that we are standing for Christ Himself, not only in terminology but in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This should be our atmosphere and the impression which we give others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to reconsider the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This book does not give us the impression of doctrines or gifts but only of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to make it clear that Christ is the life of the church, the content of the church, and everything to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the church must be the unique and pure expression of Christ and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we need to know how we can have Christ as our life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to see the detailed items in the New Testament of Christ being our content.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The book of Acts shows us that Christ was the content of the early church, and the church was the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Old Testament types also show us Christ as the content and the church as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the reality of all the offerings and of the rich produce of the good land for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is also the real ark as the very content of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tabernacle is the expression and the ark is the content.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the abnormal situation, the ark as the reality and content was not within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we minister the word, we have to stress Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have much to experience and much to learn in ministering along this line.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to learn how to minister Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ.</S>
