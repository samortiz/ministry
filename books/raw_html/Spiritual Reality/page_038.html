 <h2 class="head1">GOD COMING INTO MAN<br />
IN ORDER TO GAIN A DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s work in man is this one thing&mdash;to work Himself into man. He desires to dwell in man, to be joined to man as one, and to take man as His dwelling place. This is God&rsquo;s work in us. If we repent, yet we do not have God dwelling in us, our repentance is futile. If we confess, yet we do not have God dwelling in us, our confession is in vain. In the same way, if we do not have God dwelling in us in our morning watch, our morning watch means nothing. If God does not enter into us in our Bible reading, our Bible reading is worthless. If God does not enter into us in our prayer, our prayer has no value. If we attend a meeting, yet God does not enter into us in that meeting, that meeting is meaningless. If we listen to messages and attend special meetings, yet God does not enter into us, all of these things are futile. The most important matter in our Christian life is that God would be brought into us so that He would enter into us to gain a dwelling place. Everything is for this purpose. All our activities, whether preaching the gospel, repenting, confessing, or pursuing the Lord, are for the purpose of allowing God to enter into us to gain the dwelling place He desires.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR GOD TO MINGLE WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that the crucial matter in the relationship between God and man is that God wants to work Himself into man, and the way this purpose is accomplished is through His mingling with man. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Our being joined to the Lord as one spirit means that God is joined to us in our spirit. God is Spirit, and He also created a spirit for us. The reason God created a spirit for us is so that we would have an organ to receive Him. Only our spirit can receive the Spirit of God, which is God Himself.</p>
<p>If man had only a mind, emotion, and will but not a spirit, he would have no way to contact and receive God. This is why the more a rational and intelligent person thinks, the more he feels that there is no God. After pondering over this matter very much, many highly educated people say that there is no God. They do not realize that we cannot contact God in our mind. We can contact God only in our spirit. Whenever we disregard our mind, ignore our thoughts, and use our deepest part to touch God and to pray to God, we are filled with God. The more we pray, the more we are filled with God, and the more we pray, the more we have the presence of God.</p>
<p>I hope that all of us would see that God&rsquo;s presence with man is not in his soul&mdash;his mind, emotion, and will&mdash;but in his spirit. It is only in the spirit that man can be joined to God as one spirit. Our spirit is our innermost part where we may contact God and mingle with God. When we see the vision of the mingling of God and man, we will have the way to be mingled with God. May God be gracious to us that we may despise all other matters and simply seek to be joined and mingled with God in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS, ANSWERS, AND TESTIMONIES</h2>
<h2 class="head1"><em>Question: One time shortly after I had been saved, I was athome feeling very depressed within. Because I felt so depressed,I asked the church to pray for me. Then I met a brother on the road. After I had fellowship with him, I felt much better, but after I walked ten or twenty steps farther, the inner feeling came back again. Why did that happen?</em></h2>
<p>First, we must be clear about the way of experience. When you have a feeling, you should not immediately go to fellowship. Rather, you should shut your door and pray to God wholeheartedly from deep within. You may say, &ldquo;O God, I feel very depressed within. Please come to relieve my depression.&rdquo; After you pray, you must discern what your inner condition is and then decide whether or not you should go to a brother for fellowship. If you do not pray before you go to other people for fellowship, your inner being certainly will not be satisfied. Every feeling of depression within us is a call for us to pray to God. If we still have the feeling of depression after praying, then we should go to the brothers for fellowship.</p>
<p><em>Testimony: When I was young, I did not obey my parents, but after being saved, the Lord enlightened me and showed me my flesh. I even quit smoking and drinking. Not only so, before I was saved, I had a bad temper, but the Lord has been dealing with me little by little. This is how I have changed since the Spirit of God entered into me. I have received God, and He fills, regulates, keeps, and comforts me.</em></p>
<p>We all have to learn to touch the presence of God from our innermost part in silence. The dealings between God and man are the dealings of the Spirit with our spirit. God is Spirit, and He created a spirit for us that we may contact and receive Him. From the day of our salvation, we should learn not to pay attention to our mind, emotion, and will but to exercise our spirit to contact God and to allow the Spirit of God to come into us. This is the fellowship of the Spirit with our spirit, the echo of the Spirit in our spirit, and the feeling of the Spirit in our spirit. In this way our spirit will be strengthened, bright, and living. Because our spirit is strengthened, bright, and living, its demand will spontaneously increase, and our dealings with God in spirit will also increase and broaden. Hence, we all must learn to touch the feeling of the spirit from our deepest part.</p>
<p><em>Testimony: I have had many failures, particularly in my experience concerning this matter of our being joined to God in the spirit. It is very hard for God to reign in me because most of the things I like are frustrating to the spirit. I am one who has fallen deeply in my mind, emotion, and will. I long to be delivered from this, but practically it is not that easy. I have been trying to submit to the spirit, but I have failed every time. My wife just gave birth to our fifth child, so basically I have no way to attend the meetings. However, inwardly I felt that this kind of thinking was out of the flesh, and I had no peace in my heart, so I came. I put my self aside. May the Lord have a free way in me.</em></p>
<p>This kind of experience is very precious and accurate. It clearly shows us how our mind, emotion, and will need to cooperate with the spirit. Many times we do not touch the feeling of our spirit. Our will is unyielding, and our emotion and mind are not cooperative. We must realize that God&rsquo;s work of breaking and tearing down in us who have received mercy is to deal with our mind, emotion, and will. He wants us to be subdued. Hence, as long as we have a feeling in our spirit, we should ignore what we are thinking in our mind, what we are feeling in our emotion, and what we are deciding in our will. Those who are able to ignore their mind, emotion, and will are those who have been strongly enlightened by God, smitten by God, broken by God, and torn down by God. If we set our heart on God and desire that He would gain the ground in us, we have to be prepared for Him to strongly shine on us and smite us with His hand sooner or later.</p>
<p>Our mind, emotion, and will need to cooperate with the spirit. When we pursue God, He works in our spirit and requires us to submit to the ruling of the spirit and the demand of the spirit. When we meet a person who has much spiritual experience and who knows how to touch the spirit, we will find that he is not thoughtless, having no mind. Rather, his mind is spiritual. Although his mind is not the spirit, his mind is in submission to the spirit. We will also find that we can touch his emotion. He can easily sympathize with people, being full of love, yet we will find that his emotion is also controlled by the spirit. As for his will, he may be very strong, but once he touches the spirit, he is submissive. We may say that he has a strong but spiritual will. This kind of person is truly a spiritual man. We need this kind of spiritual reality so that our mind, emotion, and will may all be subdued to live under the spirit.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can we tend toward the center? In one of her books, Madame Guyon talks about a tendency toward the center. One who tends toward the center can see that he is opposing God, and after he has tended toward the center, he will confess and repent outwardly. What is it to tend toward the center?</em></p>
<p>This question is actually a question of what and where the human spirit is. We have said before that the spirit of man is man&rsquo;s innermost part. For us to allow the Lord to mingle with our inner man, our spirit, we first need to see that it is useless for us to only know teachings. We may have heard the teaching of living in the spirit several times, even to the point where we are able to speak it to people. But if we remain unchanged and continue to do things the way we used to do them, this teaching will not profit us. One day the Holy Spirit will give us the light and open our inner eyes to show us that the most important matter in the universe is that God wants to mingle Himself with us. From that time on, something within us will move us and change our direction. Then we will learn to touch the presence of God and to fellowship with God, and we will clearly realize that the dealings between God and man are in the spirit.</p>
<p>The dealings between God and man occur in a place deeper than man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will. They occur deep in man&rsquo;s spirit. Sometimes the dealing is silent, and at other times it is vocal. Sometimes it is without form, and at other times it is with a form. Sometimes it is an explicit word, and at other times it is merely a groaning. In such a way we learn to fellowship with the Lord, not in our mind but deep in our spirit. We begin to realize that the demand in our spirit is something that our will cannot subdue, our emotion cannot answer, and our mind cannot agree with. Our innermost being is in a certain condition whereas our soul is in another condition. It is as if we are two men, living a life of contradiction.</p>
<p>Many times within us there is a demand, yet our will refuses to submit to it, our mind does not incline toward it, and our emotion does not like it. Conversely, sometimes there is an inclination in our mind, emotion, and will, but our innermost part, our spirit, has no peace. At times like these we find that we are divided people. On the one hand, we are in the spirit while, on the other hand, we are in the soul. Moreover, our spirit is in conflict with our soul, which means that God is in conflict with us. The spirit represents God while the soul represents man. If we tell God, &ldquo;God, I want You, and I choose to be on Your side,&rdquo; then the Holy Spirit will break forth from our spirit. Once our heart chooses God and stands on God&rsquo;s side, the Holy Spirit breaks forth from our spirit. However, do not think that the Holy Spirit is that strong. Many times the Holy Spirit is not as strong as our will. This is why many people, even though they have been moved by the Holy Spirit numerous times, still refuse to repent and believe in the Lord.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Holy Spirit is able to break forth from within us, but because our mind, emotion, and will are too strong, even the Holy Spirit cannot conquer us. Because of this, God&rsquo;s hand arranges an appropriate environment to smite our being. God knows that it is only through endless smiting that our mind, emotion, and will can be subdued and controlled by the spirit. I hope that from now on in our fellowship meetings or daily conversations we would all rid ourselves of fellowshipping about blessing and peace, or matters such as receiving healing from sickness and prospering in business. Rather, we should share our testimonies of submitting to the spirit. Through this kind of mutual encouragement, everyone will desire to live in the spirit and enter into a deeper union with the Lord.</p>
<p>However, we must remember that merely listening to messages will not help us to have these experiences. We need the Spirit of God to open our eyes that we may see this, know this, and live in it. To receive more exhortations and doctrines is useless. After hearing the messages, the Spirit of God must one day open our eyes to show us that the unique way in this universe that God wants to take in us is to mingle Himself with our spirit. When we see this, our inner being will turn, and we will have a longing and prayer from within. At that time, we will reconsecrate ourselves. We will say to God, &ldquo;God, here I am&mdash;a person who has received Your mercy, whose eyes have been opened to see the way that You desire to take. God, I am willing to answer this revelation, this calling, to surrender my mind, emotion, and will into Your hands. From now on I will no longer struggle in my mind, emotion, and will. I desire to yield to You my entire being.&rdquo; This consecration is a different kind of consecration, a renewed consecration.</p>
<p>This is the first vision concerning the relationship between God and man. The first vision those who pursue and serve the Lord must see is that God wants to enter into man. To merely see that we are sinners is too shallow, and to merely see that our sins have been forgiven is too superficial. We must see that God&rsquo;s intention is to come into us and that within us we have a spirit as a vessel to receive Him. From the time we see this vision, we will surrender to Him. Then we will be joined to Him in our spirit and will no longer live in our mind, emotion, and will but in our spirit.</p>
