   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S HAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you read this book carefully, you have to admit that God's hand is behind all the writings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>More than thirty people of varied backgrounds and ideas in different times and places wrote these sixty-six books.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you group them up, they link together as if they were written by one individual.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis was written about fifteen hundred years before Christ, and Revelation was written ninety-five years after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a time span of sixteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One talks about the beginning while the other projects the end of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet whatever begins in Genesis is concluded in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This amazing feature cannot be explained in human terms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every word of it has to be written by God through man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is the motivating One behind the whole composition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>DIE FOR THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is another remarkable thing about this book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In itself it is a book that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet countless numbers of people have lost their lives for its sake.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was a time when anyone who held this book in his hand would immediately be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The most powerful empire in history was the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was a time when this empire summoned all its forces to destroy this book.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone who possessed it would be inhumanly persecuted and later killed or burned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They wiped out thousands of people and burned countless copies of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They even set up a monument at a place where they killed Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On it was the inscription: "Christianity is buried here."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They thought that when they had burned all the Bibles and removed all the Christians, they would see Christianity lying there beneath their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it was not long after that when the Bible came back again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even in a country like England, which has already accepted Christianity as its state religion, you can still find tombs of martyrs for Christ if you visit different places there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here and there you can find places where the Bible was once burned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Or you may come across a tombstone that tells you that such and such a person tried so hard and wrote so many books in his life to oppose the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One place may tell you that the Bible was once burned there, and another place may tell you that Christians were once killed there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One signpost may point you to a statue of martyrdom, and another may point to a site of Bible burning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why is it that so many people have tried so hard to oppose this book?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why is it that men would pass by other books, but would either oppose this book with every fibre of their being or would put their whole life to the stake for it?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There must be something extraordinary here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if you do not believe that this is God's word, you have to admit that there is something unusual about this book.</S>
