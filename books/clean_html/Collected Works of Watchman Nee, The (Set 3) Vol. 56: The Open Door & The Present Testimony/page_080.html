<h2 class="head2">What David Knew</h2><h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Salvation</h2><p>If I stand here and say to you, "The Lord Jesus is our Savior," you will respond, "That is right. The Lord Jesus is our Savior." But Psalm 27:1 tells us that the Lord is our salvation. It shows us that the Lord is our salvation and not our Savior. It is a fact that the Lord is our Savior. But God showed David that the Lord is our salvation. The Lord is our Savior, but He is also our salvation; He is that very thing. The Lord Jesus is the things of God. He is God's matters and God's things. The Lord Jesus Himself is the very thing that God has given us.</p><p>I have no intention of remaining too long on the exposition of the Bible. I am merely laying a foundation. If you spend some time to consider God's Word, you will see that Christ is God's things. God has not only given Him to be our Savior and our Redeemer. He has not only given Him to be the Lord of sanctification and the Lord of righteousness. He has given us Christ to be our things. Righteousness is a thing, sanctification is a thing, and justification is a thing, or a matter. But Christ is these matters or things.</p><h2 class="head2">There Being Only One Person<br />in the Christianity of Life</h2><p>You may ask, "Brother, why do you have to spend so much time on all this?" I must tell you that this is the very difference between a Christianity of life and a Christianity of behavior. There is a vast difference between these two kinds of ways. The gap between these two ways is very great. One is spiritual, and the other is not. One is of God, and the other is of man's mind. These are two entirely different things. If you study God's Word, you will find that there is only one person in His Word; there are not many things. There is only the person; there are not matters and things. There is only one person&mdash;the Lord Jesus. Other than this person, one cannot find any other matter or thing.</p><p>The biggest problem with God's children today is that the Christianity they know is a fragmented Christianity. One person receives a little grace. Another person receives a little gift. A third person picks up tongue-speaking, while a fourth person experiences some changes in his behavior. Some have love, some have endurance, and some have humility. You may consider this as Christianity. Indeed, this is the Christianity that man speaks of today. But actually, this is not Christianity. Christianity is just Christ. Christianity is not a gift; it is not Christ giving you something. Christianity is just Christ Himself. Can you tell the difference between the two? These are absolutely two different ways; they are two entirely different ways. Christianity is not Christ giving you something. Christianity is Christ giving Himself to you. The problem is that in today's Christianity, man thinks only in terms of Christ's gifts. When he was a sinner, Christ gave him grace and mercy. Now that he has become a Christian, Christ gives him endurance and Christ gives him humility and meekness. It seems as if Christ is giving him many things.</p><h2 class="head2">There Being No Non-personified<br />Things in Christianity</h2><p>In God's eyes, what is important is not the gifts of Christ. In God's eyes, He has given us Christ Himself. God has not given us humility or endurance; He has given us the whole Christ. Christ is becoming our humility, and Christ is becoming our endurance and meekness. It is Christ, the living Lord. This is Christianity.</p><p>Please remember that there are no non-personified things in Christianity. We must never receive a merely non-personified thing. In Christianity all things are personified, and that person is Christ. In other words, our endurance is not a thing; our endurance is a person. Our sanctification is not an experience; our sanctification is a person, something personified. Our justification is not an experience; our justification is a person. Our righteousness is not an act; our righteousness is a person. Our redemption and deliverance are not something that we receive at one time; our redemption and deliverance are a person. Our endurance, humility, meekness, love, etc., are the Lord Himself; they are not things. This is Christianity. Christ is everything to the saints today. There is no need to wait for that day to come.</p><p>Many people ask how we can say that Christ is all. If you know the Christianity of life, you will acknowledge that He is all. He does not give all; rather, He is all. These are two entirely different things.</p><p>Why is it that God's children fail so much today? They fail because they have only received a gift before the Lord; they have not received Christ. They have received fragmentary things before the Lord; they have not received the Christ God has given them. They have received only matters and things; they have not received a person. I do not know how much you have seen before the Lord. But I can say that when this question is resolved, all questions are resolved.</p><p>When we were saved, many of us heard God's Word, which says that He so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, so that we will not perish but will have eternal life. When we heard such a word, we felt that we needed to be saved, and we went to God and prayed, "Lord, You have loved me and given Yourself to me. Can You give salvation to me also? You have become my Savior. Can You give me salvation also?" How foolish we were! We felt that having a Savior was not enough and that we needed salvation also! Many people have done this. And what do we do in our gospel preaching? We say that God has given us the Savior, yet when we repent, we pray, "God, grant me Your salvation." However, God has only one Son, and this Son is salvation. When we have the Savior, we have salvation. Do we still have to ask for salvation? Only a foolish man would say, "God, You have given me a Savior. Now please give me salvation."</p>
