<h2 class="head1">THE RESPONSIBILITY<br />OF THE MEMBERS IN THE BODY&mdash;<br />SERVICE</h2><p>If we see that the life of the Body is a matter of fellowship and mutual supply, we will realize that before the Lord we should not be one who consumes life but one who supplies life. If many members in the Body of Christ need the supply of life and few can afford to give the supply, the strength of the Body will fail. Therefore, we must pray for others. God will supply life to other members through this prayer. Thus, when the need in others arises, such supply will be forthcoming.</p><p>First Corinthians 12:26 says, "And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it." This verse does not say that when one member suffers, all the members "ought to" suffer with it, or if one member is glorified, all the members "ought to" rejoice with it. With God's Word there is not a question of what "ought to" be done. God's Word says that when one member suffers, all the members suffer; this is a fact. When one member is glorified, all the members rejoice; this is a fact. This explains why there are times when we have inexplicable feelings. Sometimes we feel heavy within. But after two days, it is over. There can be no other reason for this except for the fact that we are related in one Body.</p><p>At the time of the great spiritual revival in Wales, there was a sister living in another place. One day while she was with two or three others praying, there was an inexplicable power of the Spirit overflowing in her, an experience she had never had before. It continued for four or five months. She could quite effortlessly get in touch with God, as if heaven were near at hand. Then one day she read the newspapers and realized that the Welsh spiritual revival had supplied her. When one member rejoices, other members rejoice also. The Body of Christ is a living Body with organic life. Paul said, "I...fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church" (Col. 1:24). Because we are in one Body, we can fill up the needs of other members.</p><p>This is not only a matter of suffering or rejoicing; it is a matter of life. Some members can supply the Body with life, while others must receive life from the Body. We should have both aspects. We truly need the supply of life from the Body, and we should also supply life to the Body. Through fellowship we receive life from the Body, and as members we also supply life to others. When we talk of the Body, it is not a mere doctrine or teaching; the Body of Christ is an absolute fact. It is an absolute fact that God's children are joined together as members of the Body. Therefore, we must gladly receive help from others, and we should also endeavor to help other brothers and sisters.</p><p>In summary, we should yield obedience to the authority of the Lord, enjoy the life of the Body, and supply life to others. These are the three main principles of our living in the Body of Christ.</p>
