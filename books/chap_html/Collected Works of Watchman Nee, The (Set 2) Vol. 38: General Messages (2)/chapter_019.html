<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE BREASTPLATE OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 28:6-7, 9, 12, 15-21, 29-30; 2 Cor. 11:28-29; 7:3; Heb. 13:17; 1 Pet. 5:1-3, 5-6</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>In His selection of men on earth, God first picked out one man. From this one man, a house was developed, and from the house, a nation was formed. The one man was Abraham, the house was the house of Jacob, and the nation was the nation of Israel. When there was one man, God appeared to him, spoke to him, and revealed Himself to him. When the man became a house, God appeared to the head of the house, spoke to him, and revealed Himself to him. After the Israelites were delivered from the bondage of slavery and after they turned back to God's authority, name, and administration to be the kingdom of God, the Bible shows us that God changed His method of revelation. He no longer spoke and appeared to individual men as He had before. Instead, He revealed Himself to His people and spoke with them according to a prescribed way.</p><p>What was this way? It was the breastplate of judgment. Through the breastplate of judgment, God revealed Himself and spoke to His people. In the past God had spoken to one man, but in speaking to a nation He spoke through one object: the breastplate of judgment. When God's chosen people became a nation, God changed His way of speaking. Whenever troubles and problems arose among God's people, they went to God and sought His guidance and revelation through the breastplate of judgment. I hope that the brothers and sisters will remember this. When you are alone, as Abraham was when he served the Lord by himself, God speaks to you alone. But when God's people are around you and you become one of God's people, you should remember that God's way of revelation changes.</p><p>This does not annul a man's personal communication with God, and it does not annul God's appearance and revelation to individuals. However, when you follow God as Abraham did, He speaks to you individually, appears to you individually, and gives you revelation individually. But when God's people are around you, something important happens. Even though your individual communication is not annulled, you are no longer alone. Instead, you are mingled with the people of God to become one being and one entity. Then God's revelation and His speaking are not directed toward you individually but toward the people of God. There is a change in God's method of speaking and revelation to His people. Brothers and sisters, we must see this in a clear way. We must see that we are mingled as one Body with all the saints. Under such circumstances, God reveals Himself and speaks and appears to man in a different way. If we have not seen this, our fellowship with the Lord may not be stopped, but our service to God will surely be off. If we want to serve the Lord and meet the need of God's children, we have to realize that God's appearance and revelation to individuals is different from His appearance and revelation to His corporate Body. Brothers and sisters, you have to realize that God's revelation to Abraham was by one way, and His revelation to the nation of Israel was by another way&mdash;the breastplate of judgment.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>The high priest wore the breastplate when he went to God; it was placed on the ephod. The breastplate was square and folded into two layers; four rows of stones were set upon it. Each row had three stones, upon which were inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. Moreover, two stones were upon the shoulderpieces, with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel inscribed on them as well. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel represented the whole people of Israel, that is, they represented the people of God. When the high priest entered into the presence of God, he did not go in alone; he had the twelve tribes of Israel on his shoulders and upon his breast. The high priest is a type of the Lord Jesus. This speaks of the Lord shouldering us and embracing us upon His breast. When the high priest went into the tabernacle to fulfill his service to God, he had to put on the ephod. He had to have all of the Israelites upon his shoulders and had to come to God with all of them upon his breast.</p><p>When the Israelites encountered a problem that needed to be solved, the high priest had to put on the ephod and the breastplate and come into God's presence to seek His speaking and revelation. The breastplate was called the breastplate of judgment because from it man found his solutions. Moses asked God to appoint a man to rule over the congregation, and God answered, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom the Spirit is....And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, and he shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah" (Num. 27:18, 21). When the Amalekites invaded Ziklag and took the women and the people captive, both great or small, David inquired of the Lord to see whether he should pursue after the troop, and the Lord said, "Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all" (1 Sam. 30:1-8, 18-19). This shows that after God's people grew from one man into a nation, God spoke to them through an instrument&mdash;the breastplate of judgment.</p><p>Within the breastplate of judgment there were the Urim and the Thummin. Urim in Hebrew means light, whereas Thummin in Hebrew means perfection. When the high priest went into God's presence with the breastplate, God's light shined and His will was fully manifested.</p>
