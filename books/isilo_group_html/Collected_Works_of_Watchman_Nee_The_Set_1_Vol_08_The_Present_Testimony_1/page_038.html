The reason for this is that as soon as a man is regenerated and receives the new life, this life will turn him away from the reign of the flesh to submit to this new life. God's life is absolute, and it will not stop until it gains full control over a person. Once it enters a person's spirit, it will free him from his former master -sin -and will bring him into full obedience to the Holy Spirit. However, sin is deeply rooted in man. Although man's will is renewed through the regenerated life, his will is still joined to sin and self, and many times it still inclines toward sin. For this reason, a great conflict exists between the new life and the flesh. Because many people experience this conflict, we will pay special attention to this experience. But we have to remind the readers that such prolonged conflict with sin (note, not self) and such defeats are unnecessary.</P><P>The flesh wants total domination. The spiritual life also requires total domination. The flesh demands that man belong to it forever, while the spiritual life demands that man fully submit to the Holy Spirit. The flesh and the spiritual life are different in every way. The nature of the flesh is of the first Adam, while the nature of the spiritual life is of the last Adam. The motives of the flesh are earthly, while the intentions of the spiritual life are heavenly. The flesh takes itself as the center for everything, while the spiritual life takes Christ as the center for everything. Since they are so different, it is inevitable that man often comes into conflict with the flesh. The flesh induces man to sin, while the spiritual life induces man to righteousness. After a believer is regenerated, there is always this experience of conflict within him because of his ignorance of the full salvation of Christ.</P><P>A young believer is often bewildered at this kind of conflict within him. As a result, some become discouraged. They consider themselves to be too evil and feel that it is impossible to advance any further. Some even begin to doubt the genuineness of their regeneration. Little do they realize that they experience such conflicts precisely because they are regenerated. Originally the flesh was reigning, and there was no hindrance to its reign at all. Moreover, because their spirit was dead, they did not feel sinful even though they committed many sins. Now the new life has come in, bringing with it a heavenly nature with a new intention, new light, and a new will. Once this new light enters into man, it exposes the true vileness and corruption in man. The new intention surely does not want to remain forever in corruption and vileness; it wants to walk according to God's will. The flesh naturally fights with the spiritual life. Such conflict causes a believer to think that there are two persons within him, each having their own opinion and strength, and each vying to overcome the other. If he goes along with the spiritual life to overcome, he will feel much joy. If his flesh prevails, he will feel condemned. This kind of experience proves that a person is already regenerated.</P><P>God's goal is not to reform the flesh, but to destroy it. God gives His life to man at the time of regeneration in order to destroy the self in the flesh through His life. Although the life God gives to man is very powerful, a regenerated person is just like a newborn baby; he is still very weak. Because the flesh has reigned for so long, it has become very powerful. In addition, the person has not yet laid hold of God's full salvation by faith. At such times, though a man is regenerated, he is still fleshly. The meaning of being fleshly is to be ruled by the flesh. It is most pitiful for a believer to be regenerated, to be enlightened by the heavenly light, to realize the evil of his flesh, and to fully desire to overcome his flesh, yet be unable to do these things because of the feebleness of his strength. This is the time when tears flow the most and sorrow is the greatest. Every regenerated person invariably has some new aspiration to eradicate sins and please God. Yet the will is not strong enough and is often overcome by the flesh. As a result we see more failures than victories. How could one not feel remorse?</P><P>The experience Paul described in Romans 7 is a story of the conflict during this stage. "For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do...For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not. For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice...I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members" (vv. 15, 18-19, 21-23). His final sighing should find an echo in the hearts of many people with similar experiences: "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" (v. 24).</P><P>What is the meaning of this warfare? This warfare is one aspect of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. God has a full salvation prepared for man. But man fails to obtain it either through ignorance or through an unwillingness to obtain it. God can only give man what he believes in, what he accepts, and what he claims specifically. Therefore, when man asks for forgiveness and regeneration, God forgives and regenerates him. By this way of warfare, God makes the believers seek and lay hold of the full victory in Christ. If believers do not have full victory because they do not know about it, they will seek to know about it after such warfare. In this way, the Holy Spirit will have the chance to reveal to them the way Christ dealt with the old man on the cross. He will cause them to believe and receive. If a believer will not receive full victory because he does not want it, all the truth he has is merely in his head. He will realize after this warfare that mere knowledge is useless; through constant failure, he will be made to aspire to experience the truth that he already knows.</P><P>This kind of warfare increases as time goes on. If believers will not lose heart, but will faithfully press on, there will be more fierce warfare ahead of them. Such warfare will not stop until the believers are fully delivered.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1) &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
