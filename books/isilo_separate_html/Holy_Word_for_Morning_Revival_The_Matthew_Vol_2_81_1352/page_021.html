To insult the Spirit is to disobey Him willfully. Many believers do this. If they confess this sin, they will be forgiven and cleansed by the Lord&#8217;s blood (1 John 1:7, 9). But to blaspheme the Spirit is to slander Him....[According to verse 32, speaking against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven in this age or in the one to come.]...In the economy of the Triune God, the Father conceived the plan of redemption (Eph. 1:5, 9), the Son accomplished redemption according to the Father&#8217;s plan (1 Pet. 2:24; Gal. 1:4), and the Spirit reaches sinners to apply the redemption accomplished by the Son (1 Cor. 6:11; 1 Pet. 1:2). If a sinner blasphemes the Son as Saul of Tarsus did, the Spirit will still have the ground to work on him and cause him to repent and believe in the Son that he may be forgiven (see 1 Tim. 1:13-16). But if a sinner blasphemes the Spirit, the Spirit will have no ground to work on him, and there will be no one left to cause him to repent and believe. Hence, it is impossible for such a person to be forgiven. This is not only logical according to reason but also governmental according to God&#8217;s administrative principle, as revealed here by the Lord&#8217;s word.</p><p>In God&#8217;s governmental administration His forgiveness is dispensational. For His administration He has planned different ages. The period from the first coming of Christ to eternity is divided dispensationally into three ages: (1) this age, the present one, from Christ&#8217;s first coming to His second coming; (2) the coming age, the millennium, the one thousand years for restoration and heavenly reigning, from Christ&#8217;s second coming to the end of the old heaven and old earth; and (3) eternity, the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. God&#8217;s forgiveness in this age is for sinners&#8217; eternal salvation. This forgiveness is given to both sinners and believers. God&#8217;s forgiveness in the coming age is related to the believers&#8217; dispensational reward. If after being saved a believer commits a sin but will not make a clearance through confession and the cleansing of the Lord&#8217;s blood (1 John 1:7, 9) before he dies or the Lord comes back, the sin will not be forgiven in this age but will remain to be judged at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). In such a case, the believer will not be rewarded with the kingdom [to] participate with Christ in the glory and joy  in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, but will be disciplined so that the sin is cleared, and will be forgiven in the coming age (Matt. 18:23-35). This kind of forgiveness will maintain this believer&#8217;s eternal salvation but will not qualify him to participate in the glory and joy of the coming kingdom.</p><p>An idle word [mentioned by the Lord in verse 36] is a non-working word, an inoperative word, a word that has no positive function and is useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren. In the day of judgment, those who speak such words will render account concerning every one of them.</p><p>In verse 37 the Lord concludes, &#8220;For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.&#8221; What a warning this is! We must learn to control and restrict our speaking.
