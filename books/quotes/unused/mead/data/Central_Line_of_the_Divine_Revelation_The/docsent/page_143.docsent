   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In John 11 Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To be resurrected from the dead is to receive the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 12:24 Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the Lord had not fallen into the earth and died, He would have been one grain alone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By falling into the earth and dying, He sprouted in His resurrection, and the one grain became many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the dispensing of the life within the one grain into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can never exhaust the significance of John 14 16.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first part of chapter fourteen tells us that Christ is the embodiment of God the Father to express Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 16-20 tell us that the Spirit is the reality of Christ to make Him real to us, and that all those who believe in Him will receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we receive the Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way we have the Divine Trinity within us dispensing Himself to us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter fifteen there is a vine tree with many branches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every day and every moment the vine tree dispenses its rich life juice into the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapter sixteen the Lord likened His coming resurrection to the birth of a child vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>16-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Resurrection is a real dispensing of the Divine Trinity into God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In John 17 Jesus prayed to the Father, saying, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me" v. 21 . The oneness for which the Lord prayed here is a coinherence, that is, a mutual dwelling of the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the believers in one another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Father, and all the believers are in the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way the believers share the oneness of the Divine Trinity.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now, in addition to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we become the fourth party in this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether or not we can explain this, it is a fact that the oneness revealed in John 17 is a oneness of four parties.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To include the fourth party in this oneness was not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord accomplished many things to get into us and bring us into the Triune God, to make us one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is all due to the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 18 the Lord was arrested, and in John 19 He was crucified.</S>
