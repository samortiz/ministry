   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RELEASE OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to the accomplishment of redemption, Christ's death has accomplished twelve things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first is that Christ's death releases the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consider a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a grain of wheat is kept in a container, it will remain alone; nothing will happen to it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for the grain to multiply by having the life within it released, the grain must die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have pointed out that in John 12 Christ had come to His golden time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had performed a great miracle in raising Lazarus from the dead, and a large number of Jews believed in Him because of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He was about to enter Jerusalem, a huge crowd welcomed Him enthusiastically.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even the Pharisees felt that their opposition of Him had been in vain because the world was following Him John 12:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every preacher in Christianity would enjoy having such a great following.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the Lord Jesus was not excited by the reception given Him by the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Philip told Him that the Greeks were interested in seeing Him, He said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, "Philip, I don't care for this welcome.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, I am ready to fall into the ground and die."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I had been Philip, I would have been very disappointed and I probably would have said, "Lord, I'm excited because this is Your golden time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For three and a half years, You have been rejected, opposed, despised, and persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now the crowds are welcoming You.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lazarus is here as a strong testimony, and everyone is convinced and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even the Greeks want to see You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But You are not excited.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, You speak of a grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What does this mean?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE NEED FOR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes, although there was a great crowd, the question we must ask is this: Is there anything of life in this crowd, in this great following?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, the life that was in the Lord as the grain of wheat had not yet been released and imparted into them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the Lord seemed to be saying, "I have life in Me, but it has not yet been released and imparted into them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am the grain of wheat containing life, but the crowd does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only through death can the life that is in Me be released and imparted into them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Philip, there is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You are excited by this welcome, by this large following.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But I don't care for the excitement or for the following.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I came that these people may have life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is needed is not excitement or a welcome or a following.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is needed is for Me to die so that the life within Me can be released into them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Philip, even you need My death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although you have been following Me for three and a half years, you still do not have My life within you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The divine life is concealed and confined in Me. I must fall into the earth and die so that it can be released to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am now the unique grain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But after My death, you all will become grains just like Me. Philip, don't be excited about this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What you need is life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You need Me to die so that you may have life."</S>
