   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OBEYING GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Recently we have been unjustly accused of being mind benders.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not bend the mind we rob it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church life robs the devilish things from our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church life we help all the saints to think one thing the enjoyment of Christ for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all think of the experience of Christ for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In doing this, we are obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we think other things, we are disobedient and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To think something other than the one thing is to rebel against God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's economy is that we think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Has a certain brother offended you?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You should not think about that offense, for God's economy does not allow you to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you think about the offense, you rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Murmuring is also rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's economy does not allow us to murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To do so is to be disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all have our disposition, and we all are accustomed to murmur, reason, and complain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if we are enlightened concerning reasoning and murmuring, we shall say, "Lord, forgive my rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I don't want to be a rebel in Your economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, I want to be obedient, obeying Your economy to think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although certain ones have offended me, I do not want to think about the offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, I want to think only of the enjoyment and experience of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To do this is to work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The salvation in Philippians 2 is actually the proper oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To work out our own salvation is to work out this genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we are not in the genuine oneness, we are in some kind of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we need the salvation which is the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to be one not only in spirit, but also in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have said again and again, we need to think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we think the one thing, we are one not only in spirit, but also in soul.</S>
