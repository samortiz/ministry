   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE NOT A MOVEMENT IN WORK BUT AN ACTIVITY IN LIFE Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 1 Cor 4:15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The main burden for this term of the training is to prepare for the spread of the gospel to the countryside that will start in January of next year.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We hope that by January of next year, we will have one hundred brothers and sisters to be the pioneers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thereafter, every two months we will have thirty more to follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In March, May, July, September, and November, we will add thirty more people each time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then in the following year, we will do the same thing by sending thirty brothers and sisters out every two months.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In all there will be twelve waves with a total of three hundred sixty people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the start of this move, the training center will produce fifteen people every month.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we cannot send out thirty people every two months, all of us will have to fast and pray because this is an important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE WORK OF THE LORD NOT BEING A MOVEMENT BUT AN ACTIVITY IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The work of the Lord on earth was never a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Gospels show us that when the Lord Jesus was working for God on earth, He did not advertise or gather huge gatherings; He did not solicit any contacts for the sake of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All social activities in human society are basically movements.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As such, they need advertisements and huge gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is also the need for soliciting contacts as a kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Lord was not promoting a movement on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the disciples whom the Lord called were mostly humble people of little education.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first pair of brothers that the Lord called, Peter and Andrew, were both fishermen Matt 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second pair of brothers, James and John, were also fishermen Matt 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A fisherman did not have a high education or refined culture; he would not have been that eloquent, much less would he have known how to advertise, how to organize huge congregations, or how to do other things of that nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the Lord Jesus were to gain the refined ones, He would have had to go to Judea to find them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the talented ones were gathered in Jerusalem, close to the city of David.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Lord began His work in Galilee, the fishing land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of the twelve apostles that Jesus called, eleven were Galileans.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only one was a Judean.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is so strange that in the end he was the very one who betrayed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This proves that the Lord was not spreading a movement on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was true not only with the Lord Jesus; with the apostles it was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Acts 4 tells us that when the Jewish Sanhedrin interrogated Peter and John, they realized that these ones were uneducated and unlearned men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This proves that the apostles were not promoting a movement either.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Next we come to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to his background, Paul was much more refined than the Galilean fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But neither was his labor for God a work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was born in the then highly cultured city of Tarsus Acts 22:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Academically speaking, doubtless he was educated in the highest school of learning there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Religiously speaking, he was taught by Gamaliel, the most knowledgeable rabbi of Judaism at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But after he was saved, he did not promote a movement either.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We only see him preaching Christ Jesus everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Jews were jealous of him; they tried their best to catch him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was forced to go to Antioch, a place not much noticed by the Jews Acts 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Antioch he did not promote any movement.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Acts 13 tells us that while they were there fasting and praying, the Holy Spirit separated Paul and Barnabas and sent them out vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This sending was not a movement; there was no formality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only a few prophets and teachers laid their hands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When they went out to preach the gospel, there was no organization or arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They preached this way until they reached the west and north coasts of the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everywhere they went they set up churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, from the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles, we cannot detect any flavor of a movement in the works of the Lord Jesus or of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is because what they did was not a movement but an activity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They were a group of people constituted by life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They knew nothing except to act according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After Paul met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he was completely changed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The former Saul of Tarsus had been a persecutor of those who believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now he became a saved Paul speaking to everyone about Jesus, even entering into the synagogues of the Jews to preach there.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everywhere he went he lived this way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For Paul, preaching Jesus was not a work; rather, it was his living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have to know that, outwardly speaking, going to the countryside for the spread of the gospel is a work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Actually, it has to be your living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some have misunderstood; they thought, "Brother Lee has gone to Taiwan to promote a great movement."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But I must tell you soberly that we are not after a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To go to the countryside for the spread of the gospel is not a movement but a living.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When you go to the countryside, you are bringing the Lord Jesus and His gospel to people and sharing with them the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This move of dispensing is not a movement but a living.</S>
