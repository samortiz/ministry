   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SMALL TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I lay sick in bed for thirty-one years just like the man in John 5 who was sick for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today I have been completely healed by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I began studying theology in a denomination in 1903.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At first I was baptized by sprinkling, but later I went to another denomination and was baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have received salaries from several denominations and preached for a few denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was just like in Revelation 3:1 where the Lord said, "I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During these thirty-one years, I was living a life that shamed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, because the denominations could not satisfy me, I also sinned for three or four years by not reading the Bible, praying, or going to meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was sixty last year according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In November I was sick for twenty days.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My physical body was very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In March of this year, Brother Ke Ts'ung Yi came to Chin Chia Pien Elementary School, Kao Tze, to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He zealously exhorted me to obey the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, I asked Brother Ke to clearly explain some of the things I doubted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After hearing his explanations, it seemed as if scales fell off my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I thanked, obeyed, and praised the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now there are a few matters I would like the brothers and sisters in the Lord to pray for on my behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, please ask the Lord to keep me and strengthen me to the end. Second, please ask the Lord Himself to do a good work in me and glorify Himself through this useless, weak vessel to testify for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, please ask the Lord to save my wife, son, daughter, son-in-law, and my grandchildren, that our whole house may believe in the Lord and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fourth, please ask the Lord to establish a place for a meeting in the Lord's name so that those who believe in the Lord with a pure heart will have a place to meet and partake of the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fifth, please implore the Lord to work in my circumstances that I may always glorify and obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Also pray that my home would be near a meeting in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sixth, please pray that the Lord would add saved ones into His precious name every day so that the lost sheep may become a flock under the hand of the great Shepherd, our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hallelujah, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Finally, I bless all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Health in spirit and body!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The smallest brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Feng Ching Yi</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>August 17, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This letter was sent in by a believer in Kao Tze, Kiangsu who was helped by Brother Ke and was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>NEWS FROM LIEN SHUI, NORTHERN KIANGSU</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Greetings to our dear brother in the Lord, Watchman:</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May the Holy Spirit within each brother pray for us, the dried-up children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have been believers in the Inland Mission for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were all blindly zealous and knew nothing about being saved and overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We often sought the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have seen the divisions among the denominations, and when we met brothers who believed in the Lord, we asked, "Which church do you belong to?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we praised his church for doing this or that or we discussed the salary the believers gave the preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our spirits were not pleased that we did not speak of the Lord's grace, but we had no alternative.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank and praise the God who loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He sent His faithful and obedient messengers, Chiu Jih Chien and Chi Yung Tung, to Chi T'ang Chi to begin the work there and to give us the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was from July 26 to August 1, 1929.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God laid hold of a few of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Satan also worked by saying, "Chiu and Chi from Su Chia Tsue are speaking the devil's doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The last days are here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are false apostles and false prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord has told us not to believe in them or be led astray."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in our hearts we felt that the Scriptures they quoted were all true.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later we bought some books from Ting Chung Shu, including The Christian Life and Warfare, The Christian, and The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But we were still cheated; we did not understand, and we placed our flesh in this life at the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We were unable to overcome for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord placed us in trials, while Satan raised up some work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Seventh-day Adventists preach a proper living, the law in the last days, and the commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many worldly people followed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In April and May of 1933, thirty-six people were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Oh, thank the Lord, He enlightened us to see 1 John 4:1-6.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the brothers and sisters in our locality were considering our love for God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord who knows man sent His messenger, Brother Chiu, to us again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In more than ten days of work, God grasped a few brothers and sisters out of the many to meet, break bread, and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We were so joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We thank the Lord and remember how much He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our Lord and His cross were livingly depicted before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our hearts could not help but respond; we each shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After about fifteen minutes, we read the Bible, broke the bread, and received the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are seven brothers and four sisters who break bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The responsible brothers are Sun Tze Kang and Chi Ju Ch'un.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We received an issue of Collection of Newsletters and learned about the conference in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Satan did a special work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brother Chi wanted to go, but his wife persecuted and frustrated him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is difficult to describe the situation in a sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord caused him to overcome, and he arrived safely in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The devil also worked so that he would have a recurrence of a chronic illness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When he suffers from this illness, it usually lasts for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This time the Lord blessed him in that he was healed after two days.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He asked Brother Chi Yung Tung to tell the brothers and sisters who love the Lord to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Thank the Lord that He heard their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In February Sister Chin began a women's work in Yi Lin.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord moved a mother and daughter, Chi P'ing Ch'uan, and another sister, Chi Tao Hua, and her daughter, Chi An Yu, to go to Yi Lin for more than twenty days of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Chi P'ing Ch'uan and Chi An Yu were both baptized in Yi Lin.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They entered into the Lord Jesus' death and are living to God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A sister was baptized here in our locality on April 15.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Every Lord's Day, the attendance is more than thirty people.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God's promise is true.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He adds saved ones to us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Every Lord's Day many sick people come.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We are still meeting in the old meeting place that the China Inland Mission used to occupy.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is in Sun Tze Kang's house.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He is saved and his wife obeys, but the rest of the people in the household are unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We hope that all the brothers and sisters who love the Lord will pray for us before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We do not know where God wants to put us because we are young and dry.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We do not know what God's will is.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Every Lord's Day, a brother who is led by the Holy Spirit gives some testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We do not know when God will give a gifted member to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>May the Lord bless each one of you.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Health and peace to your spirit, soul, and body!</S>
