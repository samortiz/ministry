We must pray in this way, in a continuous way, and in a claiming way, to claim these souls for the Lord's testimony
The principle of both the spiritual life and the spiritual work is the principle of faith, not of sight or appearance
To seek feeling, sight, or appearance means that more or less we have an evil heart of unbelief, even an evil heart of disbelief
Enclosed within the Holy Place, the priests could not see the heavens, the earth, and all the surroundings, as they could in the outer court
There was no physical light but the Shekinah light, the Shekinah glory of God; here there was not the created light but the uncreated light
In a covenant, an agreement or contract, there may be certain promises, promising something will be done for you
Christ was incarnated lived on this earth was crucified and resurrected ascended was seated and enthroned and has descended as the Spirit
We can first read the item in the will that tells us that our sins have been put on Jesus, that He has borne our sins on the cross
We have to exercise our spirit, even exercise our will in the spirit, to believe what we are told in this will
Only the Lord Himself can save people, but we can help people to receive the Lord, to accept the Lord and accept salvation
After we help people to pray, we need to help them in several matters; otherwise, they will not be properly saved
Otherwise, they will be only religious people, not living Christians; we will merely have some religious members
We should even learn to preach the gospel from Romans 12, telling people that they have to be members of the Body
We must tell people definitely and thoroughly that Christ is a living Spirit today, waiting for people to receive Him as life
Following this, we have to tell people that if they are going to receive Christ as the living One, they have to make a thorough confession
We should help them to realize how many sins they have how sinful they are and help them to repent and confess their sins in a thorough way
In the will there is such an item telling us that if we believe in His name our sins are forgiven the remission of sins has been given to us
After reading the words in the will concerning the forgiveness of sins, we should read to them about justification by faith
These two verses tell us two things, that forgiveness is announced and that justification has been given in this One, that is, in Christ
Besides showing people forgiveness of sins justification by faith and eternal life we need to show them verses that tell them they are saved
We may also use Acts 16:31: 'And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household'
We must stress these four main points from the Word they are forgiven they are justified they have received eternal life and they are saved
The very next day we may go to contact them again to help them realize that the Lord Christ is the living Spirit
After a meeting for preaching the gospel, we should ask the new believers to come for three nights of follow up
We can help them to know a little bit about the church, and they will realize that the church, the Body, is their home
We should also help them to know that we do not preach the gospel individualistically; we preach the gospel in a Body way, a corporate way
After we help them to this extent, we must help them to offer themselves to the Lord, to consecrate themselves
Regarding baptism, they have to exercise their faith to believe that in many cases a great blessing came down to those who were baptized
We should tell them that if they have any problem, even physical sickness, they take it into the water and bury it there
In the Far East and in many other places, when someone is buried, the things they loved, their favorite things, are buried with them
Matthew 12:28 and 29 say, 'But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you
Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man?
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
We all have to realize that to preach the gospel is not merely to preach or to teach; it is to fight the battle
We are the Body of the Head, and we are under the headship, so we have the Head as the 'government' backing us
It is not merely the ground that we love sinners or that we feel that there is the need for materials for the building up of the church
Recently there has been a real flow and a burden among us for the gospel, and some people already have been saved
Recently the brothers and sisters have learned how to take the standing that they have been baptized with the power from on high
We have to realize that the Body of Christ has not only been baptized with the power but also entitled with the authority of Christ
In this will we have not only an item telling us that power is ours but also an item telling us that authority is ours
It is on this standing with such a realization that we go out, not merely to preach the gospel but to pass on orders
For a policeman to give a ticket does not require much work; he simply writes the ticket, and people have to take it and pay the fine
If this is good enough, then there is no need to have a feeling, and there is no need to seek the manifestations
In our heart and in our realization we do say, 'I am here with authority,' but in our attitude with people we have to be very nice
Rather, we need to have the assurance that the Lord is with us, and His living Spirit is mingled with our word
Of course there is no need to declare to people that we are doing this but we have to do it in a proper way learning the proper way to speak
According to Romans 10:6 through 8, while we are preaching Christ, this kind of preaching becomes the living Spirit
Recently some brothers went out to preach the gospel, telling people about the Body of Christ, God's economy, and the spirit, soul, and body
We must have the assurance that we are ministering Christ to people, and this Christ whom we minister to others is the all-inclusive One
Not only is He the Savior and the Redeemer, but He is also the Head, the Lord, and the One on the throne with glory and authority
If we preach a living Christ, the Holy Spirit will honor our preaching, and the word that we speak will become the Spirit and life to others
We can point out to them that Christ is now in their heart and in their mouth because today Christ is in the Spirit and He is the Spirit
When the word is spoken at the radio station, it becomes radio waves that bring the word to every part of the earth
He will love the Lord, he will love the Scriptures, he will love to contact genuine Christians, and he will love to come to the meetings
Whenever a person would open his or her mouth to say 'Lord Jesus,' we have to say, 'Hallelujah, praise the Lord!
There is no doubt that we need love and a real concern for sinners, but going out to preach the gospel is mainly a matter of faith
The principle is that what is accomplished is according to our faith: 'According to your faith, let it be done to you'
We must take a positive attitude in faith, but this requires that we have everything cleared up and be cleansed
The enemy knows whether or not we are right with God, right with the Body, and right with the members of the Body
When we say that we have to pray much for the gospel preaching, we mean that by praying we are dealt with by the Lord very much
We will have the furtherance of the gospel, not only in this city but to other districts and even to other nations
We have to learn how to bear the responsibility, how to take care of the difficulties, and many other necessary matters
Praise the Lord, these matters will afford us the best opportunity for us to learn and be trained in a practical way!
To not have a living, prevailing, and powerful faith means that either we depend on ourselves or that we have an evil heart of unbelief
To command the Lord to do something means that we do not trust in ourselves and that we believe; the Lord will honor this faith
Learn to prove the Lord, not as the people of Israel did in the wilderness with an evil heart of unbelief, but with a believing heart
Luke 14:23 says that a master told his slaves not merely to invite but to compel people to come to his great dinner
Many times our friends give us a promise in a polite way, but after the meeting they apologize and give an excuse why they did not come
If we will all fast for one meal a day until the meeting for preaching the gospel, two hundred people may be saved
For many years we may not have had much growth in life, but if we preach the gospel in this way, we will see the growth in life
We need some brothers to accompany the speaker, and we also need many brothers and sisters to be present in the seats
When a brother speaks, the brothers standing with him say amen, and the rest of the congregation also can say amen
Right away after that, the brothers and sisters have to contact two or three, or at least one person, to care for them
In the work after the gospel meeting, every one of us must be a good midwife, knowing how to deliver the child
After we speak with someone for two or three minutes, five or six at the most, we have to influence them to pray
We should also help them to realize that by Christ's redeeming death, by the cross of Christ, their sins have been forgiven
After this kind of prayer, many persons have had a change in their life, and the Holy Spirit becomes real and living to them
By those sheets we will know how many have been influenced by our preaching and what we must do in the meeting
There may be a number of new ones who are not clear about salvation and baptism, so we must follow up with them within a few weeks
Our work must be completed by their being brought into the church life; otherwise, we must care for them some more
If one of our friends is not saved in the preaching, then we have to care for him in a second meeting for preaching in the following month
We have even something deeper than the heart that is our inmost part the human spirit to seek something better higher and more important
In past generations in century after century many thoughtful people philosophers and wise and learned men did their best to find the answer
In order to know the purpose of something, we need to go the manufacturer, the maker, and ask him why he made it
He is the living and omnipresent Spirit, and you have a spirit, not only a body and a mind, not only a soul, but a spirit deep within you
When a person receives Jesus Christ the Lord as the Savior, there are two categories of things we must take care of
Many dear brothers and sisters, even among us, are not clear about the main items that Christians must know and practice
For two thousand years many historians have studied and discussed this matter: Who is Jesus Christ; what is the person of Christ?
The Word is Christ, and this Word which is Christ was with God, and this Word which is Christ was even God Himself
Verse 18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Do not think that Christ is a separate person from God-that God is God, Christ is Christ, and these are two separate persons
The 'handkerchief' became green, but within this green cloth is the reality, the substance, of the handkerchief
One little round seed grows up to be a tree, another grows up to be a flower, and another grows up to be wheat
One day He became a man; then He died on the cross, He resurrected, and He has been transformed into a wonderful form
Acts 1043 says To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins
You will sense the loveliness of Christ, and you will sense the light, the power, the life, and the love of Christ within you
He will help you to know whether or not to hate that person, and eventually He will help you to drop your hating
He needs to know the work of Christ, what Christ has done for him and for what purpose Christ died on the cross
If we are going to enjoy Him and receive Him into us, we must open ourselves, the more the better and the deeper the better
To receive Christ is mainly to believe in Him but this believing includes several matters so we may say that there is a process of believing
Acts 20:21 says, 'Solemnly testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance unto God and faith in our Lord Jesus'
Some Christians indeed have a certain kind of repentance, but they turn only a little; they have only a little change
When he goes to open his mouth to testify for Jesus, the enemy will say, 'You are a liar,' and his mouth will be shut
It is easy to be used by the Lord to speak a word of edification, but it is not easy to speak a word of preaching
John 1:9 says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
Verse 4 of chapter three says, 'Everyone who practices sin practices lawlessness also, and sin is lawlessness'
In the Scriptures there is the law, which includes not only the Ten Commandments but many bylaws and regulations
In this country, in the Far East, and in Europe, many people are not just and righteous when they go to the market
In order to be a proper believer in Christ, you have to confess all your sins; you must make a thorough confession
You may not consider that you are sinful, but if you desire to take care of this need, go to spend some time with the Lord
Consider all your relationshipswith your parents your wife your husband your children and your schoolmates roommates friends and relatives
In addition, when many Christians check all the material things in their possession, they will find out how many sinful things they have
In order to be a living, proper believer in Christ, you need to have such a dealing, such a confession to confess all your sins before God
By the grace and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, we will be able to help people to realize that they need this kind of confession
Believers also need another kind of confession, not only the confession of sins but the confession of the Lord
It is also very strange that when people follow Confucius and tell others about it, they have a feeling not of shame but of boldness
The proper believing in the Lord Jesus includes the step of telling people that from this day you are no more an unbeliever
You should not try to be a hidden Christian, a secret Christian, or a nice Christian within but with no appearance without
You may say that this was too much, but if you were in that environment, you would realize that there was the need for it
In order to be a living, prevailing, powerful believer, you have to make a public confession of Christ before people
After you believe in the Lord Jesus right away you have to be buried because you realize that you are so sinful good for nothing but death
He told the congregation, 'This young man is a member of a Christian family, with a very nice mother and sister
After you believe in the Lord Jesus, if you seek the Lord within you, there will be the desire to be baptized, to be buried
When we preach the gospel, we have to preach to such an extent that we tell people, 'You are entitled to receive the Holy Spirit'
If you have not been baptized yet, but you have the desire to be baptized, in the eyes of God it is as if you have been baptized already
If you are willing to do these four things, you are on the ground and entitled to claim the gift of the Holy Spirit
The church of Christ is on the earth today to fight the battle for the kingdom of God, that is, to subdue the enemy and to plunder his goods
On the earth during the New Testament dispensation there is a real battle between God and Satan, a battle over people's souls
To subdue the enemy Satan and to release people from his usurping hand is one thing; to evangelize people is another thing
If we are full of energy within but are in darkness, we would do many things wrongly; the more we would do, the more we would be wrong
Every balanced, normal Christian must have abundant life within and must have adequate knowledge, truth, and light from the Word
There are not only the two aspects of life and light; we also need the other three aspects: the Body, the service, and the gospel
We might have abundant life and adequate light, but if we are not living in the Body, in the church, we are disembodied
The Lord mentioned this kind of cutting off in John 156 which says If one does not abide in Me he is cast out as a branch and is dried up
In this way we become a living Body always cooperating and coordinating together in order to subdue the enemy and release the souls
All these words are right-evangelize, gospel, preaching-but they are inaccurately used by today's Christianity
To be a living person who preaches the gospel, you have to preach with your mouth, ears, eyes, nose, two hands, and two feet
Some groups even proclaim that they are rich in life rich in knowledge and also have the church life but they are short of gospel preaching
After five years passed there were still the same number meeting with them, and after another five years there was no increase
It is good for a few people to receive the Lord, but according to my experience, this seems like two drops of water
If you would endeavor, pray, and work to bring more people in, next week you may baptize fifty, one hundred fifty, or two hundred people
The Holy Spirit within the spirit of the saints honors this, because this is the purpose of God in this age on the earth
Day by day they are growing, day by day they are being built up, and month after month a good number of people are brought into the church
Week after week, month after month, and year after year we are living here for this-to win the world for Christ and win souls for Christ
In order to do this we have to be filled with Christ we have to have light we have to be in the church and we have to be functioning members
We should keep a record of the persons who are interested in receiving the Lord or already have made a decision for Christ
They are not afraid of you as an individual, but if you call one or two brothers to come along with you, the evil spirits will be afraid
Two brothers can keep the records on file for the men who are new ones, and two sisters can keep the records for the women
The primary issue of preaching the gospel is the building up of the Body; the secondary issue is the preaching itself
It is in this way that we will be built up as a building and in the Spirit be formed as an army to fight the battle
You must have a thorough dealing with the Lord to consecrate yourselves once again and to claim the Lord's richness and fullness
The more you do not have any evidence, yet still believe, the more the Lord will honor you and honor your faith
In the books written by the apostle Paul, only Philippians speaks in a particular way concerning the preaching of the gospel
We Christians today may not know clearly what it means to have the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel
The apostle Paul prayed for them that their fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel might be carried on to work out God's purpose
In reading this word we can also realize that the apostle was burdened that this fellowship would not be interrupted
He said he was confident that He who had begun in them a good work would complete it until the day of His coming back
Verse 27b says, 'That you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel'
The word together is also very meaningful, having the sense of 'as one man, shoulder to shoulder in absolute cooperation'
In verse 5 the apostle Paul uses the word fellowship, speaking of the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel
If we preach Christ yet do not have fellowship and do not love one another, our fruit will be very limited; we will not be very fruitful
If we Christian brothers, however, live together in pure love and sincerity, this will become a strong testimony
When we live by Christ in Christ with Christ and for Christ we have love for one another and this mutual love becomes a strong testimony
In order to be prevailing and fruitful in the preaching of the gospel, we must pay our full attention to the Body life
When all these people see the kind of mutual love we have among us as Christian brothers, they will be very impressed and influenced
We will work not just by ourselves, but we will invite the brothers to work together with us in a way of coordination
We need the Body life, and the best way to be built up together is for us to have the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel
If we do not have the mutual love and the reality of the Body life, even if we invite three or four to come, they will bring only coldness
If on the other hand, we are in the Body life and we have the reality, nothing will be able to conceal that reality
When three or four brothers and sisters come to our home, there will be the influence; there will be something that warms people
We need to learn how to preach the gospel in the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel in the Body life
Those powers would not give up anyone so we must fight a battle not by ourselves individually but by keeping the fellowship in the Body life
According to Philippians, the genuine, fruitful, and prevailing preaching of the gospel is a kind of fellowship
After the book of Romans there are the two Corinthians and after these are four short books Galatians Ephesians Philippians and Colossians
God's central thought, eternal purpose, and economy are revealed in them more than in all the rest of the sixty-six books of the Bible
The experience of Christ is for the preaching of the gospel, and the preaching of the gospel is the very experience of Christ
When we express Christ, when we live out Christ, and when Christ is expressed through us, there is the preaching of the gospel
The magistrates charged the jailer to keep them securely, so he put them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the stocks
They were simply filled with Christ and filled with the Spirit, and at midnight they sang hymns of praise to the Lord
That was not merely preaching in word; that was the expression of Christ, the outward expression of the inner life
That was a strong example of the genuine preaching of the gospel, and the jailer, the keeper of the prison, was saved
If we put that story together with the writing of the book of Philippians, we can realize what the proper preaching of the gospel is
Suppose, on the other hand, that these two apostles had merely realized that their responsibility was to preach the gospel
Philippians 1:19 contains the secret to experiencing Christ- the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Regardless of what kind of situation, in life or in death, even in suffering and in prison, they magnified Christ
Wherever we are, in school or at the store, among neighbors or among relatives, there must be the magnifying of Christ in our life
We need to experience Christ within and learn the secret of how to experience Christ; then we will have an overflow of Christ
In the north of mainland China, in my hometown, we spent more than eight years trying to build up credit for the gospel
By that time we had learned more, and a group of trained persons came over from the mainland to carry on the work
Macintosh said: It will only be in the presence of the Lord one day that we will know the real result of our work
Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ, and along with the experience of Christ there is the preaching of the gospel
Do not think that the preaching of the gospel is merely a kind of activity to be carried out in a rough, crude way
The word of the prayer of the apostle is that He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus
Not only must we preach the gospel to save others, to bring souls to the Lord, but we ourselves must learn the lessons
It is not related merely to preaching but to testifying, not only by word but by our life and living and even the sacrifice of our life
The normal condition is that we live for the gospel, and the outreach of the gospel is the main part of our living
We simply abide in the Lord and let Him abide in us, and we deal with all the hindrances to life and fellowship between us and the Lord
It was also the result of one hundred twenty people giving up their country, their family, and their everything
Even at the cost of their lives they stayed in Jerusalem, regardless of the threatening situation, and they prayed for ten days
We have to work, we have to pray, we have to spend whatever we have, and we have to be willing to be spent in whatever we are
In this country there is an even greater need for a testimony in our daily walk, a testimony in the way we live
In the office as a co-worker or employee, we have to be different, not in the negative sense but in a very positive sense
According to history, a greater percentage of people has been saved through a proper testimony than through the so-called miraculous way
It is mostly those who are brought to the Lord through the testimony in the lives of the believers that stand steadfast and grow in life
We must know Christ not in mere teachings nor in the gifts, but in life-the inner life and our daily life in the spirit
In this way we can fulfill God's eternal purpose, coming together to have a local expression of the very Christ whom we experience
In order to help us, we sometimes need to have a gospel preaching meeting, but we do not trust very much in the gospel meeting
Even if we do not have a gospel preaching meeting, after one or two months we still will baptize some new ones
The first step may be to determine whether they have believed in the Lord Jesus with repentance and confession
As a third step we should know if they are ready and willing to be baptized, and then we should know if they are clear about the church life
Even if we do not have the time every day, we can separate some time at least once a week for the work of the gospel
If this responsibility is too much for a few brothers, then in fellowship more brothers can be brought in to help
As to what we have, we simply spend what we can, and as to what we are, we are willing to be spent for the gospel's sake
Monthly we can have a preaching meeting to help us, and we can all live for the gospel and work in a proper way for the long run
The book of Philippians shows us that the church in Philippi was a church that always bore the gospel as their responsibility
In the New Testament there are a number of Epistles, but only Philippians deals with the preaching of the gospel in such a clear way
We do not have such a clear mention of the gospel in Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, or any of the others
If we read this book carefully we will see that the first chapter tells us Christ is life within us that we may live by Him and live Him out
The third chapter tells us that Christ is the mark of the goal, and the fourth chapter tells us that Christ is the secret
Although Philippians is mainly on the experience of Christ, it also deals with the gospel preaching of the church
According to the whole context, the proper way to preach the gospel is to live out Christ and magnify Christ in our body
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
We have to abide in Christ, live with Christ, and live out Christ, and we have to be built up together as one in love
The Lord Jesus would never commit Himself to anyone who came in through the miracles unless that one was born again
In chapter two a crowd of people, stirred up and convinced by miracles, came to Jesus, but Jesus would not commit Himself to them
If we all live by Christ and with Christ, spontaneously we are the living and functioning branches of the great vine tree
The bearing of fruit by the branches is the outworking of the inner life, the manifestation, the expression, of the inner life
When we abide in the vine and let the vine abide in us, the life of the vine nourishes us, saturates us, and bears fruit through us
In that book we can see that the preaching of the gospel is in the experience of Christ and is the experience of Christ
The Lord did no miracle to deliver the apostle from prison but there was the mighty prevailing manifestation of Christ through this apostle
Rather, we all must pray, fellowship with the Lord, and learn to abide in Christ, to be built up, and to be one in Christ
If we consider this as a movement, we are one hundred percent wrong; we are 'in one bed with different dreams'
We never pretend to be anything but by the Lords mercy we want to learn how to live and abide in Him and how to be built up with one another
We as members have to be built up together as a living Body-living by Christ, living with Christ, and living out Christ
The proper way to bring people to Christ is the way of life, and the proper way for the church to be built up is also the way of life
After that we need the two Epistles to the Corinthians to adjust us from the wrong thought to the life of the cross
Never be frustrated; do not challenge yourself and do not be challenged by others to try to have the power to do miracles
It is in Christ as our inner life that we are built up as one to be a living expression, the living Body to express Him
It is through this expression that people gradually, one after another, are brought into the life of Christ and also into the church life
The right way for the church to be built up is the way of life and the right way for the church to preach the gospel is also the way of life
Only one thing works well, that is, to take Christ as life in an inner way and to be built up in this life as the living Body
According to Revelation 13, it is the Antichrist and his false prophet that will do many miraculous things when they rise up
Rather, Revelation tells us clearly that we have to sacrifice, to die, to be martyred, as the last apostle, the aged John, did
We simply realize that we are little members of Christ, abiding in Him, learning to live with Him and to be built up together
A brother may pray for a friend a relative a neighbor or a classmate preach the gospel to him and have a certain amount of contact with him
They may realize that this person needs a certain other brother to help take care of him, and they can pass this name on to that brother
Spontaneously he will contact the first brother to fellowship about the new one, and then they will find out what they must do
From this we can foresee and anticipate that the building of the Body will be realized through this kind of preaching
We should do things in a cooperating way, contacting related brothers or sisters to pray and fellowship with them
If we have some doubt about these two matters, we should endeavor to help this person to realize the Lord's salvation
If we have more time, and if we have only this one person in our hands, we can help him further and work on him for the Lord
If we do not have much time, if we have more persons to take care of, there may be no need to spend more time with him
What we do will pave the way and open the door for the Holy Spirit to come in, not only to work on the unbelievers but also to work on us
It is in this way that 'one stone will kill two birds'-we will have both the gospel preaching and the building up of the church
We will spend our life, our time, our energy, and our money for the Lord's kingdom, winning souls for the Lord
If we work on it a little to plant and care for it, one day we will have glorious blossoms and bountiful fruit
We have to pray whenever we receive the names of new contacts, and we should pass their names on to others for them to pray also
We are not dealing merely with a work; we are dealing with an evil force in the heavenlies, the force of darkness
Many Christians do not have the thought that the Gospel of John deals with the real outreach of gospel preaching
3:6 tells us that this birth is a birth in the spirit and of the Spirit: 'That which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
Of course, from birth we receive life, by eating and drinking we grow, and by growing we attain the fullness of life, that is, maturity
Eternity past is indicated in 1:1, which says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
As we have seen many times, this building is a mutual habitation of God and man, and it is the universal, great vine tree
John 3:25 through 30 say, 'There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification
Even in type it is very clear that the bride, or the wife, is always an increase of the bridegroom, the husband
These then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus
While the disciples were excited and came to tell it to the Lord, He said 'The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified'
Verses 25 and 26 continue He who loves his soullife loses it and he who hates his soullife in this world shall keep it unto eternal life
They wanted to see people following John, but they saw something different, that is, that people came to Jesus instead of John
They became jealous, and one day they came to John and said, 'Rabbi, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him'
Regrettably, however, many Christians today do not realize that to bring people to Christ is to have Christ increased
In the Bible there is the principle of the first mention; the first time anything is mentioned, that sets the principle for that thing
The first evangelist told us that to bring people to Christ is to increase Christ and constitute the bride of Christ
Sometimes, even many times, the more we preach, the more nothing happens, and people become disgusted with our preaching
Throughout the last two thousand years the crucifixion, the death, and the cross of Christ have been speaking to many hearts
We need the death of Christ, we need the cross, and we need the crucifixion to speak Christ more than we need our mouths to speak
Regardless of how many days, nights, months, or even years we pray, the answer to proper prayer is, 'You have to die'
If we read on, however, we come to verses 25 and 26, which clearly tell us that the principle of verse 24 is also for us
The inner life, that is Christ Himself, will be manifested, and by this manifestation, Christ will be imparted into others
Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, it seems that the preaching of the gospel is a movement, a certain kind of activity or work
It is only in the Gospel of John, the Gospel of life, that the preaching of the gospel is not a work or activity; it is an outflow of life
We must go forth to produce Christ, to have Christ reproduced, multiplied, and increased thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold
It is not in a way of work, activity, or movement, but it is in the way of life, in a way of the outflow of the inner life
If you go to the best husbandman to ask him how he helps the branches to bear fruit, he will tell you that he prunes them
When one day the environment, our situation, is not so fine, even upside down, that will be the prevailing time for gospel preaching
Once the Father, the Husbandman, touches the branch a little, their health is gone; they have some kind of illness
People will not care for this kind of speaking and will listen to it in the same way that they listen to the news
The outflow of the inner life is the fruit, and many times this outflow comes out only by trimming, cutting, and pruning
Whenever we open our mouth, there will be the prevailing power, not merely an outward power but the power of the inner life
John 15:7 and 8 say, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you
If we add all the foregoing items together, we can see where our shortage is and why our preaching is not prevailing
Many in today's Christianity think that gospel preaching is a matter of activities, evangelistic campaigns, and crusades
How much we have been dealt with by the Lord and how much we have learned the lessons must be tested by the building
If this is the case, we can be assured that whenever we open our mouth to preach the gospel, there will be the convincing power
The gospel preaching is the increase of Christ, and this increase can be possible only by our being put to death
For many years we have seen reports concerning the gospel with numbers in black and white, but where is the real result?
The saints in Taipei simply have a life for the gospel, and monthly and yearly a number of people are brought into the increase of Christ
We need the patience to be built up, and this building up is revealed in all of the steps we have fellowshipped about
In the first three Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke-there is the commission for gospel preaching, seemingly in a way of activity
In the last Gospel, however, the Gospel of life, this commission is not mentioned in the way of activity but in the way of life
Even after Jude there are the seven epistles in the book of Revelation, which is at the end of the entire New Testament
In John we have the way to preach the gospel in and by life, the way to preach the gospel by the mending ministry
It is very easy for Christians to realize the way of preaching the gospel that is mentioned in the first three Gospels
Otherwise, we cannot see it; it will seem that in this Gospel the Lord never says anything about the preaching of His gospel
The Lord did speak of the gospel, but He spoke in the way of life, not in the way that the natural concept can apprehend
Only a few, who have been truly helped by the mending ministry, the ministry of life, are still in the church life
For the long run, the best and proper way for the church and the members of the church to preach the gospel is the way of life
To have life is good for ourselves, but if we are going to impart life to others, we must have life abundantly
On the one hand, he passed out tracts and preached the gospel, but on the other hand, he argued with people and easily lost his temper
The head considered that since he had studied in America, he knew all about Christianity, and he did not need it
That couple again contacted the poor brother and his wife and asked them how they had such a beautiful family life
The department head was not happy with this poor brother so he did many things to persecute him and the little brother suffered all the time
The first Presbyterian missionaries who went to China had a real love toward those poor Gentiles, and they had a testimony
The people made a corporate decision that no one in the whole village would open his door to any of the foreign missionaries
Not one person in the whole village would come out of his home until the gong was sounded again because the missionary was gone
He would push the door until he was half through it, and then regardless of what the people inside did, he would push all the way through
In China in the early days, almost every home had a grinding room with a millstone to grind the wheat and corn
If someone was rich, he would use a horse or mule to do the work, but if he was poor, he would do the grinding by himself
We must be able to show to the whole universe especially to those for whom we are concerned that we are living members of the Body of Christ
To do this, we should invite the brothers and sisters who are built together with us to help us deal with the unbelievers
When we invite the brothers and sisters to help us deal with the unbelievers, they will sense that there is something among us
One brother who came to our meetings went back and told people, 'Oh, you do not know what kind of meeting that was!
We must also pray for the sinners, preach the gospel to them, have the testimony of life, come together in love, and be truly built up
If we have such a meeting in oneness and in life, full of love and the release of the spirit, this kind of meeting will impress people
Even through such a wedding meeting, however, this woman was saved simply by the atmosphere, which was sweet, full of love, and inspiring
Even if people cannot understand in their mentality still their heart and spirit can sense that there is something sweet and convincing here
Before one elderly brother among us was saved, he asked Brother Watchman Nee many questions, but Brother Nee did not answer
We will be accustomed to it, and whenever we contact people, we will not pay much attention to talking, preaching, or arguing
In this message we will consider the last chapter of the Gospel of John and the first chapter of the Song of Songs
According to the human concept, we would never imagine that there would be a story of shepherding at the end of John, the Gospel of life
John 21:14 says, 'This was now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples after He had been raised from the dead'
Verses 15 through 17 continue Then when they had eaten breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of John do you love Me more than these
As we have seen, the first section of the Gospel of John, in chapters one through three, deals with the birth of life
The last section, especially from chapter ten and onward, is for the maturity of life, that is, for the building up
The birth of life is a matter of the spirit, growth is a matter of drinking and eating, and maturity is a matter of oneness
The end of chapter twenty says, 'Moreover indeed many other signs also Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book
These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name'
We know we need to grow, to pay our full attention to growth, and we have seen the light that we have to be built up
At the end of the other three Gospels, there is the commandment, the so-called great commission, from the Lord to go and preach the gospel
After asking the Lord to show His love, the seeking one immediately realizes His love and says, 'For your love is better than wine
Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you
Verses 5 and 6 continue, 'I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon
Even according to the flesh, if the brothers and sisters do not have children, there is something seriously wrong
Sometimes after a few months, one of those sisters would get married, and after two or three years she would have children
When those sisters married and had their own children, however, there was no way for them to give their children to someone else
We have to take care of some spiritual children, either some young believers, some new converts, or some unbelievers
Whether someone knows the way of life and how to feed on the Lord Jesus will be tested by his feeding of others
To feed others is a matter of life, just as for mothers to feed their children is a matter of life, not of knowledge or anything else
If the church life is proper and normal, we all will take care of some spiritual children and continually feed them
You have to consecrate yourself to the Lord and seek the Lord's guidance, and you need to have the anointing within
What you need is a real experience of life, the real way to know how to feed on the Lord Jesus and experience something of Him
You also will know what other people need, and you will know what you have to minister to others, what you have to feed others with
You will be humbled, you will be calmed down, and you will become sympathetic with others who bear responsibility
Let us all take the burden, the responsibility, not only to help others but to feed others, to feed some spiritual children
