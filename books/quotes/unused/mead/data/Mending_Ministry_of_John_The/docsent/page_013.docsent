   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you abide in Him, you will bear much fruit John 15:5, 8, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fruit does not mean behavior or good deeds; it is the expression of a life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To bring forth fruit is to live Christ out in your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Expressing Christ in your daily life depends upon your fully realizing that you are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the vine, and you are a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Together you are one organism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the real Christian life: a mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we live this way, we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There will be no division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The oneness we enjoy is simply the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even among couples there is not oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The wife may be pleasant and gentle, yet she still has her ideas about how things ought to be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The husband may be considerate and mild mannered, but he has his opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They cannot be one as long as they are not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They may not fight, but one of them is traveling in the air and the other on the ocean!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are liberal toward each other, so things appear peaceful, but they are traveling in different circles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This may also be the situation in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You lack the real oneness because you are in your mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You give others the liberty to travel on the ocean, while you remain in your higher opinions in the air!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no possibility for the church life unless you come back to this uniting and mingled spirit, that is, Christ as the life-giving Spirit mingled with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is here you must remain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is to this that John's mending ministry is calling us back.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christians have been distracted from this, but John comes to remind us that the Lord is in us and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must abide in Him and let Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we live in spirit by the Lord, we shall fully enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We shall experience reality and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this one organism, that is, Christ mingling with our spirit, we grow, we live, we walk, and we have our being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have no argument with our spouse and no argument with our fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ABIDING IN OUR SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This oneness is mysterious yet simple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we abide in our spirit with the Lord, all the complications and distractions will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If, however, we remain in our doctrines, we shall keep getting more complicated and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only way out is to return to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here we have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit with the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here Christ as the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we are one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must turn away from every distraction and return to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we live Him, we shall enjoy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is our wonderful Christian life, which issues in the church life.</S>
