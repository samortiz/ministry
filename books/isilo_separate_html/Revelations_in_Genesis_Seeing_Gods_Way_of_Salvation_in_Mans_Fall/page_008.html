<p>A fifth result of man&rsquo;s first fall is that man was not only constituted a sinner, having a record of sin before God, but he was also cursed by God. God said, &ldquo;Cursed is the ground because of you&rdquo; (Gen. 3:17). Adam was the head of the old creation, and he represented all the old creation. Therefore, Adam&rsquo;s sinning brought in a curse upon the old creation that he represented. Because one man sinned, all creation was made subject to vanity, groaning, travailing in pain, and hoping to be freed from the slavery of corruption (Rom. 5:12; 8:20-22).</p>
<p>God also said, &ldquo;Thorns and thistles will it [the ground] bring forth for you&rdquo; (Gen. 3:18). This speaks of disharmony in creation. Originally, creation was in harmony, but when Adam, the head of creation, sinned and was no longer in harmony with the Creator, all creation lost its harmony as well. This disharmony has produced the killing and the lack of peace in the universe today.</p>
<p>Not only was the ground cursed to bring forth thorns and thistles, God greatly multiplied the pain of the woman in her childbearing and made man eat bread by the sweat of his face (vv. 16-19). These are curses that man brought upon himself when he fell.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Cast out of Eden</h2>
<p>Being cast out of Eden is the sixth result of man&rsquo;s first fall. Verses 23 and 24 say, &ldquo;Then Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he was taken. So He drove the man out.&rdquo; God formed man from dust and brought man into the garden of Eden so that he might contact the tree of life and be transformed into precious materials as symbolized by gold, bdellium, and precious stones (2:10-12; cf. footnote 1 on verse 12 in the Recovery Version of the Bible). Regrettably, however, man contacted the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was corrupted before he contacted the tree of life. Therefore, until the corruption that man incurred could be dealt with, God could only send him forth to return to the ground from which he came. Man was from the dust of the ground, and to dust he was to return. Henceforth, in his sinful condition man could no longer enjoy the pleasures in the garden of Eden or take of the fruit of the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bringing In Death</h2>
<p>The seventh and final result of man&rsquo;s first fall is death. God warned Adam that in the day that he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would surely die (v. 17). When Adam violated this forbidding commandment and ate the fruit of this tree, he experienced death. Death can be divided into a few steps. First, man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened. This happened when he ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. At that time, his fellowship with God was cut off, and he could no longer use his spirit to contact God. Second, his body died. Genesis 5:5 says, &ldquo;All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, and he died.&rdquo; Third, there is an eternal death. Except for God&rsquo;s redemption, Adam would be cast into the lake of fire, along with all those whose names are not written in the book of life. This lake of fire is the second death (Rev. 20:14-15).</p>
<p>Romans 5:12 says, &ldquo;Just as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death; and thus death passed on to all men.&rdquo; Adam&rsquo;s sinning brought in not only sin but also death. Who would have thought that one transgression would bring in such tragic results? All the tragedies in the world of the old creation are due to that one fall of man. The result of sin is indeed dreadful!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
