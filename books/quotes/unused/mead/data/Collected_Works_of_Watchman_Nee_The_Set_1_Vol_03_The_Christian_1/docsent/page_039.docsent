   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REVELATION NEGLECTED BY MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis, the first book of the Bible, tells about Satan being cursed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation, the last book of the Bible, covers how Satan will be defeated in the future and how God will execute judgment upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The true face of Satan and his eternal destination are recorded in these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason, Satan particularly hates these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He attacks the book of Genesis, saying that it does not agree with science and that the story of creation is only a myth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the surface what he attacks is the record of creation, but in so doing he subtly hides his cursed background.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the book of Revelation, which prophesies his destiny, he resorts to a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not openly attack the book of Revelation, but he changes it to a book of "hidden instructions."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He convinces the believers that this book is very difficult, profound, and hard to understand, and that even if one studies and researches it, it would just be a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, many believers read some of the other books in the Bible but do not dare to touch the book of Revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way, Satan easily covers up his coming humiliation!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know that the book of Revelation was despised by early Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only did they despise it; they rejected it totally.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can find this out from the study of history.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today in the twentieth century, although there are a few a very few Christians who are willing to read this book, the majority of believers demonstrate a cold attitude toward it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many would place it on a high shelf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The probable reason some people do not read it is that they do not even read the other books in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Naturally they would also abandon Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are others who, having no trust in the Holy Spirit, have no patience to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They often say, "This book is too profound and too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I cannot understand it."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In fact, there are many strong reasons why the book of Revelation is not welcomed and is even considered a stumbling block by men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In brief, besides the frustration of Satan, the contents of this book hardly leave a pleasant impression upon the worldly believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is concerned with the glory of the millennial kingdom and the happiness of the eternal kingdom 20:1-9; 21:1 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is glory and real joy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But those who want to enjoy this glory and joy must be "faithful unto death," "hold fast until I the Lord come," be "watchful," "repent," and be "zealous."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who would gain the future world must renounce the present world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they suffer today, they will have glory in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, those who have the glory of the world now will be put to shame in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many worldly believers cannot part with this world because they have been attached to it for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When suddenly faced with the prospect of bidding it farewell, they have difficulty cutting off the affection for it in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more they read Revelation, the more bothered they become.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, they give up reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, this book mostly speaks about God's wrath and judgment chs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>4 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man prefers to hear about God's kindness and love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In their imagination God is One who never gets angry or judges people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet, this book tells about God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His wrath and judgment are not welcomed by men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why would they read this book if they do not welcome it in their heart?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The whole book of Revelation, from beginning to end, talks about supernatural things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God does not want men to be concerned solely with things in the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God wants us to see Him face to face; He wants to deal with us in the supernatural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Men can tolerate supernatural stories about the past because past events and past circumstances do not have any effect on them today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if these supernatural things will still occur in the future, would it not deal a great blow to their materialistic mind and their disbelief in signs and wonders!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moreover, if many of these things are to really happen in the future, how much should men pass their days in godliness and in glorifying God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a pity that many people, because they cannot tolerate the simple and direct teachings of Revelation, decide to spiritualize this book instead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They consider this book to be an allegory that does not really have historical value for the future!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How the flesh is put to shame before God's two-edged sword!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Truly the heart is deceitful above all things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people think that the world is getting better day by day and that all civilizations are improving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They think that the world is advancing and making progress and that there is no evidence of its degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To them, if the world continues to improve at the present rate, the ideal society of Christ will arrive on earth soon.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What a striking contrast between Revelation and the thought of man!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Revelation never considers for a moment that the world is progressing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Its testimony is that the sins of the world are increasing, that men have rejected God and His salvation to an incurable degree.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God has no other way but to judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even when God uses severe judgment on them, they still will not repent!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This applies not only to the world but to the church also.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because the church left her first love, she was eventually vomited out by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Man's thought today is completely different from the Word of God!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Revelation is a testimony for God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It does not seek to go along with men.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For this reason, it is not welcomed by men.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is pitiful that many people have lost the spirit and the testimony, as found in Revelation, which witnesses to the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That the real church ought to arrive at a certain standard is yet another reason that people do not like Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The required standard of the church, described in chapters two and three, is really embarrassing to the believers who love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today, men pay great attention to work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The top Christian is one having a great deal of outward activity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Revelation tells us, however, that all the works are in vain if one leaves his first love.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The person who is truly for the Lord must be faithful unto death and must be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The worldly believers, of course, find this unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The idea men have today is that all the people in the whole world will be saved eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Revelation opposes this.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It prophesies that countless people will perish in the lake of fire forever.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How can those who consider themselves kinder than God face this?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>People think the punishment of the sinner is just temporary and that eventually it will all go away.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Revelation opposes this.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It prophesies that men will suffer in the lake of fire eternally and that there will not be a day of rest for them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This book is a record filled with disasters, calamities, curses, troubles, and warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No wonder it is not accepted by man!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In conclusion, Revelation opposes every one of man's opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>That is why up until now there are still very few men who study this book.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But with what a different attitude the saints who love the Lord treat this book!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They receive supply from it when they are in want, support when they are discouraged, comfort when they are sad, assistance when they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This book wipes away their tears, increases their faith, and revives their will.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>How the saints who are willing to suffer for the Lord love to read this book!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They become poor and lonely for the sake of the Lord and walk on this narrow path of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Although this is a suffering according to man's view, they find comfort in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Truly, believers have much hope in this book!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Would not the coming of the Lord Jesus give happiness to those who love to see His appearing?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Although they suffer on the earth, is it not better than anything when they are raptured to the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Would not the New Jerusalem, the city of gold, create in them an avid desire?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Though they give up much, would they not receive much more when they become co-kings with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The suffering they have now is temporary and light.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Will not the coming glory in the millennial kingdom and the eternal kingdom be the highest and the most matchless?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Revelation is truly a blessing to the Christians!</S>
