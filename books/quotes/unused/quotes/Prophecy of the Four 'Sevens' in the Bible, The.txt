If we are going to know the prophecy concerning the consummation of this present age we need to know the truth concerning these four sevens
The prophecy of these four 'sevens' is related to the Messiah , the nation of Israel, the New Testament believers, and the church
Weeks are forty-nine years, sixty-two weeks are four hundred thirty-four years, and the last week is seven years
After these coming seven years Gods kingdom will be on this earth and that will be the thousand years for Christ to reign in the millennium
These three and a half years are the very hub of John's prophecy of the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls
100, John wrote the book of Revelation, so the time between the writing of Daniel and the book of Revelation is about six hundred years
Despite such a long period of time, their writings are one in their prophecy concerning the end of the present age
The apostle John and the prophet Daniel were one in the prophecy concerning the consummation of the present age
John's quoting of Daniel in this way shows us that he was one with Daniel and that his prophecy was given based upon Daniel
Another evidence of John being one with Daniel is that the beast in Revelation 13:1 corresponds with the fourth beast in Daniel 7:7
The ten horns the ten kings and the beast in Revelation 1712 correspond with the ten horns the ten kings and the beast in Daniel 72324
We need to have the standing and angle of Daniel and John in receiving the revelation and in seeing the vision
At the time Daniel saw the vision of these seventy weeks, the country of Israel was lost into the hands of the Gentile nations
The holy city was destroyed, the holy temple was devastated, and they were in captivity for about seventy years
In the millennium Christ will be the righteous One , and He will rule the thousand-year kingdom in righteousness
There will be an age, which will be the age of the ages, the age of the new heavens and new earth, in which righteousness dwells
Today we need the vision and the prophet, but when the seventy weeks are fulfilled, we will not need them anymore
He will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, setting up his image in the temple as an idol to defile the holy temple of God
After the final three and a half years of this age, Antichrist will be completely destroyed, and the temple will be cleansed and cleared up
The three and a half years of the great tribulation are referred to as forty-two months , or twelve hundred sixty days
Once this service is set up, all the people will be blessed in the offering of the sacrifices and oblations to God
History tells us that from the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the year that Christ was crucified was exactly four hundred thirty-four years
70; and the end of it would be with a flood, and there would be war even to the end; the desolations were determined
The interval after the sixty-two weeks and before the last week of the seventy weeks is the age of grace and the age of the church
Revelation 10:7 says that these mysteries will be completed, finished, and over at the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet
In the middle of the last week of the seventy weeks, Antichrist will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease
In Matthew 24:15 the Lord speaks of 'the abomination of desolation spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place'
According to Revelation 13:14 and 15, the abomination of desolation is Antichrist's image, which is set up in the temple as an idol
In other words, the idols will remain in the temple for three and a half years until Antichrist is fully destroyed by Christ
The last week of the seventy weeks will be cut into two halves by Antichrist's breaking of the seven-year covenant he will make with Israel
The sixth seal will be the initiation of the great tribulation of three and a half years, the last half of the last week
On the one hand, God will shake the earth and the heaven, making the earth an unsuitable place in which to live
On the other hand, Antichrist will break his covenant with Israel, and he will persecute the Jews and devastate the temple
The seven bowls will be the last woe of the great tribulation, and this tribulation is referred to as 'the hour of trial'
The one before the tribulation will be for the overcomers, and the one after the tribulation will be for the majority of the believers
We need to give heed to the prophetic word as to a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts
It seemed impossible that after so many centuries they could be brought back to their forefathers' land and be formed into a nation
According to recent news reports, some of the Jews are preparing for the rebuilding of the temple with all its services
The tendency of the development in the political, economical, and military situation in Europe is toward that of a strong man rising up
From the day that this strong man, Antichrist, signs this covenant with Israel, there are seven years left to the end of the present age
When we see the fig tree symbolizing the nation of Israel becoming tender and putting forth leaves we should realize that the summer is near
We need to watch and be ready to be taken, by being 'stolen' by the appearing Lord as the secret 'thief,' into His presence in the heavens
We need to be on guard that our hearts would not be weighed down with debauchery, drunkenness, and anxieties of life
We may even come to a meeting, but our heart is not in that meeting because it is preoccupied with worldly things
We need to guard our hearts because we do not want the day of the great tribulation to come upon us unexpectedly as a snare
We have to prepare ourselves for His coming by loving Him so that we can grow in Him and be matured for His appearing
In the previous message, we saw the prophecy of the first 'seven' the last week of the seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24-27
In Matthew 24:15 the Lord speaks of 'the abomination of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place'
The Lion is a symbol of Christ, portraying Him as a strong fighter against the enemy, as prophesied in Genesis 49:8-9
When the Communists took over, they did their best to oppose, to restrict, and to persecute anyone who wanted to practice being a Christian
The running of the fourhorse race begins from Christs ascension and continues through the entire age of the church to Christs coming back
In figure, the altar is in the outer court of the tabernacle and the temple, and the outer court signifies the earth
A white robe signifies that the martyrdom of the martyrs was approved by the Lord, and rest signifies that they are resting in paradise
The seventh seal, the entire contents of the seven trumpets, includes the supernatural calamities of the first four trumpets
The seventh seal includes the seven plagues of the seven bowls as a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet
The kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever
After His ascension, Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, and the Lamb opened this scroll
The seven seals with which the scroll is sealed are actually the contents of the scroll and the contents of the book of Revelation
In the first message, we saw the prophecy of the first 'seven' the last week of the seventy weeks recorded in Daniel 9
The supernatural calamity of the sixth seal will affect the earth and the heaven the sun, the moon, and the stars
Their prayer in Revelation 6:10 is also referred to in two portions of the New Testament Luke 18:7-8 and Revelation 8:3-5
These saints are crying to God for the avenging of their blood, which they shed for God's purpose and for God's testimony
After their prayer, God begins to judge the earth in the sixth seal to make it an unsuitable place in which to live
In chapters seven, eight, ten, and eighteen of Revelation, Christ comes in as God's Angel to serve and to take care of God's chosen people
As we have pointed out, the sixth seal is the initiation of supernatural calamities executed on the earth and on the heavenly bodies
The locusts have a king over them, the angel of the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon
In the fifth trumpet Satan as a star falls to the earth and Antichrist as the king over the army of locusts torments people for five months
The locusts here are not like the locusts in Exodus 10:12-15, because they have tails like scorpions, and stings, and they injure men
They must be demon-possessed ones, because they come out of the smoke which issues from the dwelling place of the demons
The sixth trumpet is the second woe as further judgment on men two hundred million cavalry troops killing the third part of men
The authority of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails, which were like serpents and had heads, and with them they injure men
Chapter eleven says that Jerusalem will be given to Antichrist and his people and will be devastated for forty-two months
Chapter twelve points out that right before the beginning of the great tribulation, the man-child, the dead overcomers, will be raptured
The firstfruit of the believers will be raptured to the third heaven to be with Christ before the great tribulation
The destruction of religious Babylon, the apostate Roman Catholic Church , will take place at the beginning of the great tribulation
They will be considered as goats and will be cast directly into the lake of fire, where they will suffer eternal punishment
The seventh trumpet will bring in the coming age of the kingdom and the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth
The seventh trumpet includes the coming of the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ, in which He shall reign forever and ever
The overcomers shall be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium
Satan's deceiving of the nations which are in the four corners of the earth is his deceiving of 'Gog and Magog'
Ezekiel 38:2 indicates that Gog and Magog are of Rosh, Meschech, and Tubal, answering to Russia, Moscow, and Tobolsk
At the end of the millennium, Satan will instigate rebellious mankind from the uttermost parts of the north to attack God's people
The judgment at the great white throne, after the earth and heaven fled away, is to judge the unbelieving dead with the demons
The lake of fire is the 'trash can' for the entire universe, into which all negative things, including death and Hades, will be cast
Since the unbelievers have followed the devil they share the devils judgment and will become joint partakers of the devils eternal torment
The New Jerusalem, the holy city, will come down to the new earth as God's tabernacle and as the bride, the wife of the Lamb
The restored nations will be the people around the New Jerusalem and will be sustained by the leaves of the tree of life
Romans 92728 says that the Lord will cut His word short in order to have a quick fulfillment of His prophecy concerning the nation of Israel
As we have seen in the previous messages, the nation of Israel as the fig tree has become tender and put forth its leaves
In the first three messages of this series on the prophecy of the four 'sevens' in the Bible, we have seen the first three 'sevens'
We have fellowshipped concerning the seven years of the last week of the seventy weeks, the seven seals, and the seven trumpets
In this message we want to see the seven bowls, which are the main part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet
Before the seven trumpets, there was already a judgment on the earth and on the hosts of heaven at the sixth seal
At the seventh trumpet, there will be further judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun through the seven bowls
The first time is in the sixth seal, the second time is with the first four trumpets, and the third time is with the first four bowls
The destruction of those who destroy the earth includes the binding and imprisoning of Satan in the abyss for one thousand years
There will also be the casting of the 'goats,' those who worship Antichrist and who do not receive the eternal gospel, into the lake of fire
After the destruction of Antichrist and the imprisoning of Satan the nations who are left on earth will be judged at Christs throne of glory
Christ will judge them, not according to the law of Moses or the gospel of Christ, but according to the eternal gospel
The nations who receive this gospel and who treat God's people well during the time of the great tribulation will be considered as 'sheep'
The destruction of those who destroy the earth also includes the burning of those who join the last rebellion of mankind
After the unbelievers and demons are cast into the lake of fire, death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire
The old heaven and old earth will pass away, and there will be a new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem
The seven bowls are the third woe , the last seven plagues to finish the fury of God , as the most severe judgment on men
In His last fury, God will mark the rebellious ones with a sore on their skin because they bear the mark of the beast
When the third bowl is poured out, the rivers and springs will become blood, and people will drink the blood-water
When the fourth bowl is poured out, the sun will burn men with fire, and men will be burned with great heat and blaspheme the name of God
His kingdom will become darkened, and they will gnaw their tongues for pain and blaspheme God for their pains and for their sores
The gathering of the Antichrist the false prophet and the ten kings with their armies is the collecting of the grapes into the winepress
The pouring out of the seventh bowl brings in the greatest earthquake ever and the great hail of the exceedingly great plague
The physical Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, will be given the cup of the wine of the fury of God's wrath
After the seventh bowl is poured out with the greatest earthquake, Revelation 16:20 says, 'Every island fled, and mountains were not found'
The weight of every hailstone is a talent, about one hundred pounds, and men blaspheme God because the plague is exceedingly great
In the midst of the downpour of this great hail, those in the empire of Antichrist will continue to blaspheme God
In the last three and a half years, the Lord will use a 'universal broom' to sweep away all the negative things on the earth
The last three and a half years will be for the Lord, on the positive side, to bring in His eternal kingdom and the eternal righteousness
There will be the eternal kingdom of Christ with His righteousness, which is the righteousness of the ages, the eternal righteousness
According to Joel 2:30-31, there will not be much difference in time between the sixth seal and the first five trumpets
The sixth seal is the initiation of the great tribulation and should be considered as a part of 'the hour of trial'
In the restoration of the nation of Israel, which began in 1948, the Jews returned to their fathers' land in unbelief
They will become as sinful as 'Sodom' and as worldly as 'Egypt' until the return of Christ, their Messiah, when 'all Israel will be saved'
The locusts of the fifth trumpet only torment men for five months, whereas the two hundred million horsemen kill the third part of men
Christ will come to the air probably before the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet , for the purpose of taking full possession of the earth
He will come down to the air and get everything ready so that He can come to the earth directly to take full possession of it
Now we need to see the contents of the seventh trumpet, which will probably be trumpeted on the last day of the three and a half years
The two witnesses prophesy a thousand two hundred sixty days , so they must also be raptured on the last day of the three and a half years
Both the majority of the saints and the two witnesses will be raptured on the last day of the great tribulation
Christ will judge His believers, not concerning their eternal salvation, but concerning their dispensational reward
The first four bowls consist of the four aspects of the most severe supernatural calamities on the earth and on the heavens
Supernatural calamities will occur three times: in the sixth seal, the first four trumpets, and the first four bowls
The negative side of the seventh trumpet also includes the binding and imprisoning of Satan in the abyss for one thousand years
Following the defeat of Antichrist, Satan will be bound and imprisoned to clear up the rebellious earth that the kingdom of Christ may come
The overcomers will be raptured, and the majority of the living saints will be left to pass through the great tribulation
Since the earth, the land, signifies the nation of Israel, this 'another beast,' the false prophet, will come out of the Jews
He may be Judas Iscariot , because after he died he went to 'his own place' , not to 'his people' as others did
In Daniel 12:11-12 one thousand two hundred ninety days and one thousand three hundred thirty-five days are mentioned
Daniel 12:12 says, 'Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days'
In the previous message, we saw the last three and a half years of the present age and the great tribulation of the three and a half years
On the positive side, these three and a half years are to bring in Christ's eternal kingdom and the eternal righteousness
There will also be the war at Armageddon, waged by Antichrist, his false prophet, the ten kings, and their armies
The dead unbelievers will be judged at the great white throne after the millennium and will be cast into the lake of fire
The overcoming Christians will be raptured before the three and a half years of the great tribulation, being kept out of the hour of trial
There will be a new universe the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God
The Old Testament prophecies were made firm by Jesus Christ the Lord and by some of the apostles in the prophecies of the New Testament
At the time of Christ's first coming, the people of Israel were expecting the coming of their God-promised Messiah
Many of them missed the coming of their Messiah in their time because of Christ's appearing from Galilee instead of from Bethlehem
After Herod died, they returned to Nazareth, 'that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene'
Apparently, Jesus came from Nazareth, but actually He was born in Bethlehem, fulfilling the prophecy in Micah 5:2
The chief priests and the scribes missed His coming, but the magi from the east saw His star and came to worship Him
All of these scripture references show how fine the New Testament prophecy is concerning the resurrection of the dead
Revelation 12:5 speaks of the man-child being raptured to the throne before the three and a half years of the tribulation
Revelation 14:14-16 speaks of the harvest of God's crop on this earth, that is, the rapture of the majority of the saints living on earth
Revelation 15:2 depicts the overcomers who have passed through the tribulation and the persecution of Antichrist
These ten kings, ten horns, are also likened to the ten toes of the great image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream
Revelation 17:8a says, 'The beast whom you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into destruction'
Revelation 1710 says And are seven kings five have fallen one is the other has not yet come and when he comes he must remain a little while
The sixth one, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when Revelation was written; therefore, it was said of him that he 'is'
When he comes he must remain a little while and he will be slain and resurrected with the spirit of the fifth who is Nero to be the eighth
Revelation 17:11 says, 'And the beast who was, and is not, he also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into destruction'
In that resurrection, the spirit of Nero , which comes up out of the abyss, will animate the dead body of the seventh Caesar, Antichrist
We know that the spirit of the coming Antichrist is the spirit of Caesar Nero because of Revelation 13:18 'Here is wisdom
Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six'
Christ will come with the clouds and every eye shall see Him those also who pierced Him and all the tribes of the land shall wail over Him
For as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be
Christ also will be clothed with a cloud in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth
The appearing of the Lord's coming, His parousia, will be at the end of the three and a half years of the great tribulation
Our study of the prophecy of the four 'sevens' in the Bible is timely, especially because of the world situation today
Question Are the overcomers who have already been raptured to the throne included in the judgment in the air at the judgment seat of Christ
He will bring all the nations and the believers into their proper posts for a new start in the kingdom of a thousand years
Question: We have seen that the temple will be rebuilt and the priestly service will begin again with the offering of sacrifices
When the Lord returns at the end of the twelve hundred sixty days of the great tribulation, He will destroy Antichrist
After the cross, in the millennium and even in eternity, the offerings will be a memorial, pointing back to what Christ did on the cross
Does that mean that some during the great tribulation will receive their testimony and receive salvation by grace?
On the one hand, the believers who remain on this earth during that time will surely be preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus
It also says that they are killed, that their corpses lie in the street of Jerusalem, and that after three and a half days they are raptured
Are the two witnesses raptured after twelve hundred sixty days or after twelve hundred sixty-three and a half days?
The three and a half days that their corpses lie on the street are included in these twelve hundred sixty days
