   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that we could have this conference with thousands of seekers coming here to seek after You according to Your revelation and vision.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, open up this mysterious book to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Grant us, Lord, the understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Grant us also the inner seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sustain us and maintain us to the end. Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The subject of these messages is the application of the interpretation of the New Jerusalem to the seeking believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The burden for the messages in this book can be expressed in the following four statements:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.The New Jerusalem is the greatest and the ultimate sign in the Scriptures, signifying an organic constitution of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2.Its base is pure gold, signifying the divine nature of God; it is the solid foundation of its throne for the divine administration, which is the glorious center from which proceeds the divine and human communication, signified by its street, to reach all its twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3.Its gates are pearls, signifying the issue of the secretion of Christ's redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-dispensing resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>4.Its wall and its foundations are precious stones, consummated by the Spirit through His transforming and building work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past we released many messages to interpret this section of the Word on the mystery of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, there is no need for us to repeat any past interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We want to go on to apply to ourselves what has already been interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this first message, we want to see and enter into the application of the significance and the base of the New Jerusalem.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation 1:1 says that the Lord Jesus sent His angel to John to make His revelation known by signs, so the New Jerusalem is the greatest and the ultimate sign in the Scriptures 21:2, 9-10 .</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not something organized, but something constituted organically.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The holy city is a constitution in life of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is an organic constitution of two parties: God and man.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the temple of God, yet it is the dwelling place of His redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because this is God's temple, the dweller must be divine, but what about us?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Are we divine or human?</S>
