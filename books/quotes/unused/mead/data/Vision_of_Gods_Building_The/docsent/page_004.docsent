   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All good Bible students agree that the eighth Psalm is a continuation of Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Notice, the Psalmist did not begin this Psalm by declaring, "O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the heavens " No, he did not stress the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, he said, "How excellent is Thy name in all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe the Psalmist was meditating during the night when he wrote this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being human, as we are, he considered God's heavens, the moon and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As he beheld the heavens, however, he did not exclaim, "What is an angel that Thou art mindful of him."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No, he asked, "What is man " I do not understand this wonderful reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Psalmist was considering the heavens, yet he quickly reverted to man and to God's care for man on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I point out these verses only to illustrate that in the thought of the Psalmist there was perhaps a place for angels, but in the divine concept, man's position was much more important.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And to God, earth is much more important than heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the end of this Psalm, God is again praised for the excellence of His name in all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>GOD'S EXPRESSION AND REPRESENTATION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Heaven and earth are the realm and sphere of God's creation, with so many created things as the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the earth, with man as the center, is God's primary concern.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why does God need man as the center of His creation?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because man is the expression and the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are acquainted with all Scripture, we will clearly see that God's deep desire is to be expressed, and, even more, to be represented through man upon this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God exists in this universe, but who has seen Him?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's deep desire is to be expressed, not through or by Himself, but through man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The New Testament uncovers this great mystery: God manifested Himself in flesh, in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know God is real, yet no man had ever seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, He has now been expressed through humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is constantly desirous of expressing Himself, using man as His vessel and representative on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God never ordained anything else to be His representative, holding His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Out of the multimillion items of His creation, God ordained only man to be His representative on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why man was expressly made in God's image and committed with God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you bear God's image, then you express God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You are a photo, a reproduction of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man exists for one purpose, that is to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But such an expression is only possible when we actually resemble God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we acquire God's likeness, we will then express Him and have His authority and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is God's intention for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later, we will define God's purpose in being expressed through man and represented by man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our present aim is to clearly point out that God's intention in creation is to have man as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>GOD'S CONCEPT OF BUILDING IN THE CREATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The thought of building is in Genesis one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God said, "Let us make man in our image, and let them have dominion " God first mentions "man" in the singular number, but follows with the plural pronoun, "them."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Did God then create one man, or many men at that time?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The answer is, when God created man He did not create a small individual, but a collective man, including you!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God created you and the entire human race in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So, the man God created is collectively singular.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The "old man," Adam, failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So He had to create another man, a new man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The question arises again, is this new man one person or many persons?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Again, we must answer, the new man is also one!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, from God's viewpoint, there are only two men in this universe: the old man and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All in Adam belong to that old man, and everyone who is in Christ belongs to the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Testament says that Christ created in Himself one new man out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are further told that this one new man is the Body of Christ Eph 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So this new man is a collective man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are Christians then one or many?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Corinthians 10:17 says that we are many, yet we are one bread, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are many, yet we are one, collectively one; and we must be built up as one.</S>
