<h1 class="title">SIX ITEMS OF CHURCH SERVICE<br />
TO BE BUILT UP</h1>
<p>From the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Los Angeles until now, the church service has never been adequately built up among us. Although our church service has gone through a number of changes, not that much has been built up. What do we mean when we say the church service? To say that the church service refers to ministering Christ for the building up of the Body is very good, but it is too spiritual. The service must be a practical matter. Others may say that, in principle, the church service should build up the Body of Christ. But that is the New Testament ministry. The Lord has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12). None among us would understand church service to be this. A number of saints consider the church service to be chair-arranging, cleaning the hall, ushering, and preparing the bread and the wine. Although we may say that the church service is to take care of the needy saints and care for the needs of the church, this is too general. We must find a way to put this kind of care into practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BASIC AND SUBSIDIARY ITEMS NEEDED<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>There are a number of items that are needed for the building up of the church. The first matter is to build up a proper study of the truth. When I came to this country, I was charged by the Lord to carry out His recovery here. This was altogether something new. My first burden was to release the truth, so I traveled. I did not have the time to do other things. Many saints were brought into the recovery through the truth. The truth is our foundation, but among us the truth has not been adequately built up. Even some of the denominations have built up a study of the truth of the Bible.</p>
<p>The second thing that needs to be built up is the growth in life. The preaching of the gospel is a third matter that must be raised up among us. The truth, the matter of life, and the gospel are three anchors which are basic for the building up of the church. If the church is not built up in the truth and in life, and is not preaching the gospel to gain people, there is no future. The church is nothing without the truth, without life, and without the gospel. The eldership in each church is first responsible to build up a locality in truth, life, and the gospel. Through the preaching of the gospel, there is the spreading of the church as the kingdom of God. There are a number of subsidiary things that are also needed, such as the children&rsquo;s work. The children&rsquo;s meeting must be built up. In addition, we must do a work among the elementary, junior high, high school, and college age students. These four levels must be built up.</p>
<p>The third subsidiary item that needs building up is the gospel in the community. The community gospel is a particular item that we must build up. When I labored in the church in Chefoo from 1940 to 1943, the strongest item that was built up was the community gospel. There was no need for anyone to come and preach. It was done by the housewives. Whenever we held a conference, there was no need for the elders or the other saints to help the new converts because almost all of the attendants were neighbors of the housewives who were sisters among us. There was a strong community work built up among the saints who were mainly housewives. Immediately after every conference meeting the housewives would accompany the new converts home. During this two-mile walk home which took about thirty-five minutes, there was no talk about anything else except the messages of the conference. The housewives took the opportunity that this long walk afforded to help the others. This became a custom among us.</p>
<p>These six categories which include truth, life, evangelizing, the children&rsquo;s work, the student work, and the community gospel work, should be our goal in the church life. The church is not here merely for ushering, preparing the bread and the wine, cleaning, vacuuming, or chair-arranging. We can hire people to do the cleaning, the lawn mowing, the tree cutting, and so forth. Then all of the saints&rsquo; time can be saved for other things which no hired ones can do. Our church service should issue in the building up of the truth, the building up of the life matters, and the building up of the gospel preaching. In addition, the church service should care for the children&rsquo;s meeting. The church service should include care for the students. The student work itself has three levels including gospel preaching, feeding the new ones, and perfecting the growing ones.</p>
<p>Even in our neighborhood there must be a children&rsquo;s meeting that should not be considered as the children&rsquo;s meeting of the church. This is a children&rsquo;s meeting work in the saints&rsquo; neighborhood. It is easy for us to set up two children&rsquo;s meetings. Every week one sister can take care of two children&rsquo;s meetings with four helpers. On one day, two sisters can assist this one to take care of twenty children. Maybe on another afternoon two more sisters may help to take care of another children&rsquo;s meeting of fifteen to twenty children. We can collect a number of children out of our neighborhood into our home. We can ask the children to sit down on the carpet. We do not even need a piano. There is no need for materials or textbooks, but one living person. She can even sing a song to the children. Within two months we can build up two children&rsquo;s meetings. Then after six months we will have six children&rsquo;s meetings. One sister will not need to take care of all the meetings directly because other sisters will follow her example and have their own meetings. There may be ten children&rsquo;s meetings under the direction of one sister. This would expand to over a thousand children. All of these children are linked to their parents. So through the children many homes will be opened for the church to evangelize. This is the community work. These are the <em>warm doors,</em> and the parents will welcome us. Although people today are occupied by many things and it seems as if they are not open to the gospel, the best way to overcome this is to have a children&rsquo;s meeting in our own home. The responsibility for this community work lies with the elders.</p>
<p>Since 1932 when a church was raised up in my hometown of Chefoo until today, I have not had the adequate time to build up these things. The first matter that I was burdened to release in this country was the truth. At that time about one hundred churches were already raised up, but the truth had never been released. So I spent at least three months before every semi-annual training to write the footnotes and references. Because that occupied me so much, I did not have the time to help the churches. After I finished the footnotes on the Recovery Version, I realized that I must go to Taiwan to set up an experimental place to study our present practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Although we may say that we are rich in truth, most of this truth is on our bookshelves. Actually, the truth has not been built up among us, especially the seeking after the truth, the study of the truth, and the learning of the truth. Among the saints there is not much of an atmosphere of seeking after the truth. There is not much of a seeking spirit after life or the growth in life. The real church service is to take care of the six categories of things that we have indicated. Let us spend our time, energy, and everything on these six items.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP A CHURCH SERVICE<br />
FELLOWSHIP MEETING</h2>
<p>The elders of the church may want to bring the saints together for a church service meeting every week. In this meeting the saints would be given the opportunity to share with the others who are present what aspect of service they were involved in that week. If a question is raised up, we should let all of the saints answer it. By this mutual fellowship in the church service meeting, all of the serving ones will pick up a real burden. The beginning of the meeting will be full of prayer, and all of the attendants will be on time. In such a meeting we could see the real church life with the church service.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR SERVICE AS PRIESTS<br />
TO OFFER LIVING PERSONS TO GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 15:16; John 15:16</h1>
<p>The Lord has definitely and clearly shown us in these days that our New Testament service in the church must be a kind of priesthood of the gospel. In the Bible there are two stages. The first stage is the Old Testament and the second stage is the New Testament. Whatever was there in the Old Testament was a type of the better things to come (Heb. 7:19, 22; 8:6; 9:23). The better things to come are in the New Testament stage. If we look into the Old Testament service, the main thing that we find is the priesthood. The entire service of God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament was a priesthood. A priesthood denotes a body of priests built up together. There was no individual service, for all the priests served as a body. The high priest and the other priests were burdened and charged to carry out a certain part of their unique service. In the English language, the word <em>priesthood</em> denotes two things. In 1 Peter 2:5 and 9 it means a body of priests, whereas in Hebrews 7:12 it refers to the priestly service. A group of priests were there to carry out the priestly service. All those who were engaged in the priestly service mainly offered sacrifices to God every day. In Numbers 28 and 29 the children of Israel were charged by God to offer daily the continual burnt offerings morning and evening. It was called the continual offering because it never ceased morning and evening.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OFFERING LIVING SACRIFICES</h2>
<p>Today we are the New Testament priests. What should we offer? As the New Testament priests of the gospel, we must offer living sacrifices; we have to offer persons. Our service must not concentrate on business affairs which in the eyes of God are nothing. Rather, it should concentrate on living persons. This is why we are called the New Testament priests of the gospel (Rom. 15:16).</p>
<p>Paul is a pattern (1 Tim. 1:16), a model, of all the New Testament saints in that he handled people all the time. He preached the gospel to the unsaved to beget them, fed them to enable them to grow, and built them up (1 Cor. 4:15; Gal. 4:19; Col. 1:27-29). Whatever he did became a kind of offering to God. We must have a change in our thinking. For many years we thought that church service was just to do things such as vacuuming the carpet, arranging the chairs, mowing the lawn, trimming the trees, or preparing the bread and the wine. Sometimes our service also included two other things. One was to stand on the platform and give a message; the other included visiting the saints. These last two matters are worthwhile because they are directly involved with people, but the other things such as cleaning, arranging, and ushering are just sundry matters. To distribute the bread and the wine at the Lord&rsquo;s table is really good, but that kind of service is too minor. New Testament priests should daily offer living persons to the Lord. On the one hand, the Lord added people to the church daily (Acts 2:47). On the other hand, the church should offer people to the Lord daily. In the Old Testament God charged the children of Israel not to stop burning the sacrifices on the altar (Lev. 6:9-13). They were charged to burn the sacrifices, not just the wood. Of course, this is a type of our service today.</p>
<p>Every day the church should offer living persons to God. We all have to endeavor to carry out this new practice. What has been our service in the church in the past? Was that the New Testament priesthood? From this point of view we all have to admit that in our church life there is very little that could be considered as the priesthood. During the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, some brothers always come forward to bless the bread and the cup and distribute them. This is very good; it is better than nothing. However, this alone could never be considered as a priestly service to God. Only the priesthood that offers real sacrifices to God is counted by God as a priestly service rendered to Him. Neither can vacuuming the carpet, ushering, or cleaning the windows be considered as a part of the priestly service.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, all of the small responsibilities were carried out by the Levitical service, not the priests. When we come to the New Testament there is no difference between the priests and the Levitical service. Those who vacuum and clean must be priests as well. We perform the Levitical services in preparation for offering something to God. During the Old Testament time, there was surely the need of some service to clean the altar, prepare the wood, and so forth. These sundry duties were a preparation for the offering of the sacrifices. If the altar is clean, neat, and properly kept, yet without any sacrifice on it, God could never be satisfied. There must be some sacrifice burning on the altar. Therefore, the total service of the priesthood, including the Levitical service, is to offer sacrifices to God. The service of vacuuming, cleaning, and arranging could never be considered as food to satisfy God. We must offer something as God&rsquo;s food to satisfy Him. What we have been doing in the sundry things could not be counted as the priesthood. I would rather see many of us bringing living sacrifices to God than maintaining a large, clean hall with only a few saints meeting.</p>
<p>We must go to contact people. Do not hope that others will bring forth children for us to adopt. In John 15:16 the Lord said, &ldquo;I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit.&rdquo; We must go to gain some new ones. Then these new ones will become our folks. We must go and take care of them. In this way we will surely have some living sacrifices to offer to God.</p>
<p>Recently a brother among us went to Taipei for eight days. While he was there he attended various meetings in five different halls. He reported that the district meetings for prophesying, the prayer meetings, the central meetings, and the small group meetings were all living and fresh. The church in Denver is also practicing this way of prophesying in the meetings. At present, one third of the saints are prophesying in the meetings there. We do need a change. The old way was wrong and off the mark. We must come back to the God-ordained way that is revealed in the New Testament. This is a battle, and we have to fight for this way. I am so grateful to the Lord for the change of the system in that large church in Taipei with five thousand meeting together. Everything there is in order and is going on quite well. Our thinking must be turned from merely doing things to the matter of contacting and handling people. We all must have a new start.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOING FORTH TO BEAR FRUIT</h2>
<p>One way to reach people for the gospel is to go out in teams of three. We should not expect to get into every door. If out of twenty doors one is opened to us, this is very good. Each team should not expect to bring one hundred to the Lord in one year. If within one and a half months each one of us could gain one who is properly baptized and taken care of, that would be wonderful. If a church has about two hundred meeting together and each one gains three or four a year, this is a threefold increase. We should not expect quick results. To take the quick way does not work for the long run. We must go the slow way. When we come together as a team, we must put our opinions on the cross and go on together. Then the Lord&rsquo;s blessing will be with us.</p>
<p>The secret of success is to go slowly. Do not expect to gain a big number. After going out for two or three weeks, a number of persons will be saved and baptized. These will become our children to feed and raise up in the home meetings. Eventually we should gather them together into a small group meeting. The small group meetings are mainly for perfecting the saints. In the first few weeks, we may need to go out twice a week, but after a few weeks, once a week is enough. This is the way for us as New Testament priests to gain the living sacrifices to offer to God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING A PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE<br />
THAT PRODUCES THE MEMBERS<br />
OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we pray for the service of the church that all of the saints might be stirred up. Lord, we look unto You. Grant us mercy and grace that we may be touched deeply in our heart and in our spirit. Lord, open us that we may be open to one another. Grant us a frank and thorough fellowship that we may touch Your heart. Lord, we are open to You. Lord, do open to us and give us the mercy and the grace that we need for the present way. Amen. Lord, give us the grace to pray. How much we need Your grace that we may have a prayer life to pray for Your interests on this earth and for the increase and spread of Your church. Build up Your Body. Amen.</p>
<p>Years ago while we were there at Elden Hall in Los Angeles, we began to stress one thing&mdash;not to remain in the old religion. In Christianity today everybody knows how to start a meeting. As the believers come in, they just sit in their pews waiting for the meeting to open. Then a pastor opens the meeting, and a hymn is called. This is followed by singing and prayer. This is what we call religion. This kind of practice requires no exercise of our spirit. Although twenty-five years ago we overcame that, gradually, after a number of years we slipped back into that old religion. When we come to meet with the saints, we must be the first ones to open up the meeting, either by singing, by praying, by giving testimonies, by fellowshipping, or by asking questions. We should not come into the meeting hall and just sit there looking at the walls or the clock. This is wrong.</p>
<p>To meet is not just to sit there and listen to others. To meet means to pray, to sing, to testify, and to fellowship. We have all been drugged by Christianity. Unlike those in that old religion, we need not wait to enter the meeting hall before we start to sing. If we sing on the way to the meeting, surely we will be filled in spirit. The Spirit is the praying Spirit, the interceding Spirit, the praising Spirit, and the singing Spirit (Rom. 8:26; Eph. 5:18-19). We must learn to release the Lord within us, to release our spirit. We can release the Lord from within us by praying, singing, or shouting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING OUR HEAVENLY GIFTS</h2>
<p>Because we have been drugged by Christianity, all of our heavenly gifts have been annulled. First, we have the gift of divine life. This divine life is within us. Second, we have received the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is also within us. We have the divine life and the Holy Spirit within us as two big gifts. Within us we do have a big deposit in our spiritual bank. Our deposit today is worth more than ten billion dollars. We should use it and &ldquo;write&rdquo; many checks. There is no reason not to use the divine Spirit and the divine life.</p>
<p>Another gift that has been robbed from us is the privilege and right to pray and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We have the full right to exercise in this way, but because of tradition we do not pray, call on His name, shout, or testify to enjoy the divine life. If all of us in the church life would use our heavenly gifts, the church would be fully revived and quite living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>I began the ministry in this country in 1962. In those first eight years or so, we discarded everything of religion. Yet twenty-two years later I felt that the whole recovery had somewhat fallen back into Christianity. So I stopped the work in this country and went back to Taiwan to study our situation.</p>
<p>I discovered that our entire Christian life has been drugged because we do not believe or live out what the Bible unveils to us. We live a Christian life that is so natural and traditional. But I realized that the Christian life is a priesthood and we are priests. A priest is one who serves God and offers something to God. It is not a matter of doing so many things. Rather, how many sacrifices can we offer to God for His satisfaction?</p>
<p>The New Testament priests of the gospel must offer up saved sinners. They must gain the sinners and make them parts of Christ, members of Christ. By imparting Christ into sinners, we make them sons of God. All of these sons of God become the brothers of Christ who are His members. Because all of His members are His parts, we can offer the parts of Christ to God. This is something more than what the priests offered in the Old Testament. They only offered the individual Christ in type. They did not offer the reality of Christ. Today we do not offer the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, including the members of His Body. In order for us to produce the members of Christ, we must go to the homes to &ldquo;dig out&rdquo; the sinners. They are concealed there, so we must dig them out. However, we must realize that not everyone has been chosen by God. Whether someone has been chosen by God or not is not up to us. But it is up to us to dig them out. Some of them are the sons of peace (Luke 10:6). These are the chosen ones. We then infuse something of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God into them. We tell them that Christ is God incarnated to live on this earth. He died an all-inclusive death on the cross that dealt with sins and many other things. Now He is living in us in resurrection as our Savior, Redeemer, and life-giving Spirit. We must minister such a One into the sinners. After five minutes, they will be infused with Christ and declare that Jesus is very good.</p>
<p>When a new one is at this point we must help him pray to believe in the Lord and receive Him. Immediately this sinner becomes a son of peace and a son of God. This son of God is also Christ&rsquo;s brother. As a brother of Christ, he is a part of Christ&rsquo;s Body. So he becomes a part of Christ. As New Testament priests of the gospel, we can now bring this sinner who is a part of Christ to the altar and offer him to God as a sacrifice. The Christian life is the life of a priest who gains sinners and offers them to God.</p>
<p>This is our Christian life. We do not handle animals such as lambs, goats, or sheep, but living persons. We must care for these living persons as our own children. We need to feed them, cherish them, and raise them up. As they are now the folks in our family, we surely must educate them, teach them, and instruct them. We ourselves must be in contact with the Lord to receive something of Him. Then, in turn, we inject them with the riches of Christ again and again. Then we can bring them to the small group meetings and the church meetings to instruct them and lead them to do the same thing we do.</p>
<p>This is the church life. This is the life that we should live today. However, this life has been annulled and confiscated by religion and tradition. Our only interest on this earth today should be to live such a Christian life.</p><h2 class="head1">BEGETTING SPIRITUAL CHILDREN</h2>
<p>We must all realize that a proper Christian life is a life of handling the gospel to produce the members of Christ. We must continue to feed them, perfect them, edify them, and build them up. We should do this year after year for our entire life. According to our physical life, if we do not have children, we become miserable, especially when we grow old. Without children we have no interest to live. Spiritually speaking, the principle is the same. As Christians we should have spiritual children. Two or three children should be under our care all the time. This must not be according to our likes or dislikes, but our duty and responsibility. Those who do not have any physical children have a great deal of time to produce and care for spiritual children.</p>
<p>We need not adopt anyone, for we can go to the sinners, beget them, and make them our real children. Those who have no physical children are blessed because they are not that occupied. They are not occupied, exhausted, or troubled by their children because they have none. They should go to gain spiritual children, not by adopting them but by getting them regenerated.</p>
<p>Although we may have physical children, we may still be barren in the spiritual sense. We should not spend all of our time and self with our own children, but share our time, heart, energy, and ability on spiritual children. The Lord cares very much for His own children and He desires that we gain more for Him. If we live such a Christian life, surely all of us will have one remaining fruit each year. This one will be a solid, real, living member for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARRYING OUT OUR NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>The proper Christian life and proper church life are to carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. Four steps are needed for the fulfillment of this New Testament priesthood. First, we must preach the gospel to gain sinners and make them members of Christ. Second, we should hold home meetings to feed and nourish the new believers in order to raise them up. Third, we must educate and perfect them that they may know how to live the Christian life, function as living members, and do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ as the gifted persons do. Fourth, they will be raised up to speak for the Lord, that is, to prophesy for the direct building up of the Body of Christ. This is the New Testament priesthood in full and the complete gospel that we must carry out. This matter will be accomplished by the Lord. It has not been recovered yet, even among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Today is the time for the Lord to recover this. What is happening today in eastern Europe and other countries is a tide. No one can stand against the tide of democracy. In the same way, no one can stand against the God-ordained way. It will become and has already become a tide to flood over the entire Christianity.</p>
<p>We must change our concept of the Christian life. The practical way to have such a change is to begin practicing the priesthood of the gospel by going forth to visit people and bearing remaining fruit. This is accomplished by having the home meetings, the group meetings, and prophesying in the larger meetings that the Body of Christ may be organically built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING AND GOING IN FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>As we have fellowshipped before, we can go forth to visit people in teams of three. It is good for each team to contact other saints in the church who are not able to go out. They can stay at home to pray. It is best to have three at home praying for the three who are going out. In this way all six can have thorough fellowship. The teams of three who go out should let the others know when they go, where they go, and what they will do. After visiting people, the teams should pass the names of their contacts on to those who are praying. As a result, each team&rsquo;s work will be strengthened by others&rsquo; prayer. This is the way for the entire church to be brought into the same activity, even though a number are not directly involved in the going out.</p>
<p>In addition, the best way to have an impact and keep the morale high is for all those who go out to come together once a week and fellowship together. Then some brothers can be in the meeting to give further training and remind those present how to carry out their New Testament priesthood. This will serve to increase our impact and uplift the morale among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRACTICING OUR PRIESTHOOD<br />
IN A REGULAR AND DILIGENT WAY</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to continue our practical fellowship concerning the church services. As we have realized in earlier chapters, the first step in God&rsquo;s ordained way to serve is to preach the gospel as New Testament priests by visiting people in their homes. An effective way for this to be carried out is for the local saints to be formed into teams of three for going out.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACHIEVING SUCCESS BY BEING<br />
REGULAR AND CONSISTENT</h2>
<p>In order for the gospel teams to carry out a successful work, they must go out in a regular and consistent way. All school teachers know that students must attend school regularly. If the school term is four and a half months long, the students must go to their classes daily and weekly. Occasionally within one school semester students may need to ask for a leave of absence or remain home due to sickness. That is common and excusable. However, if the attendance of a class often ranges from a high of sixty to a low of thirty, it will be difficult for any proper lessons to be taught to that class. If our gospel team attendance is not regular, we may have results, but those results will not be satisfactory.</p>
<p>According to my own experience, only one place where I labored had satisfactory results&mdash;Chefoo, my hometown. I also worked for a while in the nearby town of Tsingtao and had a great part in the work in that church. After spending time in Shanghai for quite a long time, I went to Taiwan. From 1950 on, I labored in Manila in the Philippines every year for at least three or four months. Then I came to the United States. In conclusion, I realized that the situation was the same everywhere. Generally speaking, although the teachings we gave were not so adequate, the saints were very responsive. They accepted the teachings and did something to put them into practice. However, the results were not satisfactory. This was due to the fact that our kind of service was not carried out in a regular way. Every class that achieves satisfactory results must be regularly attended. A class of forty-five today and thirty-five tomorrow could not be successful.</p>
<p>Of course, if everyone in a church of two hundred fifty to three hundred were serving, that would be wonderful. However, we cannot expect everyone to serve. I do expect, though, that fifty to sixty saints would rise up to go out and visit people in their homes.</p>
<p>In February of 1986 I called an urgent elders&rsquo; training and gave messages on the matter of being in one accord. I received a real burden from the Lord to sound the trumpet like Gideon to form an army. I believed and did expect a number to join me to fight against the &ldquo;Philistines.&rdquo; At that time I made it clear that if some do not join my army it does not mean that they are no longer a local church. I said strongly that they are still a local church. I only requested that they not criticize or oppose the army, since this would cause trouble and then division. Instead, they should pray for this army. This army will fight in order that the recovery may gain some fruit. We must fight against this enemy of barrenness. Those who followed Gideon to fight against the Philistines defeated them and rescued the entire nation of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Although I studied the Lord&rsquo;s new way in Taipei since 1984, I did not have the adequate time to help the trainees to be ushered into its proper practice. I had to take care of three other things&mdash;the training, the church in Taipei, and the translation of the Recovery Version into Chinese. After five years of study, I can now conclude that the new way involves four main steps. We must first exercise our priesthood to bring sinners to be saved and baptized. Second, we must feed the new ones in their homes. After nourishing the new ones to grow, we can then form them together into a group to have group meetings in order to educate and perfect them. Last, by perfecting them to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord, they can directly build up the Body of Christ by speaking for the Lord in the larger meetings.</p>
<p>After traveling and visiting many churches during the past two years, I realized that everyone has learned the doctrine of the new way. Recently on the island of Taiwan many of the co-workers went out to visit the churches to speak the same thing as I did. Although there is much speaking concerning the new way, nearly no one practices it. Our situation is similar to a coach who speaks all the time concerning how to get the ball and shoot, but none of the team members shoot or play ball. We may even become eloquent speakers of the new way so that the saints know everything, but nearly no one is &ldquo;playing ball.&rdquo; We may argue that to some extent we have been playing, but we still play in a natural way. Who cannot play basketball in a natural way? Everyone can. Furthermore, we may play the piano for our entire life, yet still know nothing, because we touch the keys in a natural way.</p>
<p>If at the present time we have no new ones under our care, we must go to visit homes to bring sinners to believe and be baptized. There is no need to gain too many. To gain three or four is adequate. Concerning the skill required to bring people to be saved, we need to receive some instructions. For example, it may be advisable to go to &ldquo;warm doors&rdquo; first, rather than &ldquo;cold doors.&rdquo; The warm doors are those of our relatives, cousins, and in-laws. These doors will always be open to us; we will not be rejected. We also have our friends, neighbors, classmates, schoolmates, and colleagues. We should make a list of all of these friends and relatives and classify them according to what kind of persons they are. Some will be easier to gain than others. Due to this, eventually we may not need to knock on some cold doors. The friends and relatives that we bring to the Lord and baptize will bring us to their own relatives and classmates for us to visit. Then more warm doors will be open to us. Eventually, this will become a kind of chain reaction. Then, every door will provide us with ones to save and baptize.</p>
<p>It is just a matter of our diligence. We do not need to do too much, but just give the Lord two and a half hours every week. When we give this time to the Lord, we must mean business. No school teacher could keep a job if he or she were unaware of the number of students in the class or ignorant of which lessons to teach. Before giving this time to the Lord every week, we must stir ourselves up by prayer. We must catch the spirit of gospel preaching through prayer.</p>
<p>After three or four are baptized, we should immediately begin to feed these new ones in their homes. Do not insist that they come to our home for home meetings. On the contrary, we must go to their home. This is the real home meeting. Here we can feed them for a few weeks or even three or four months, depending on each person. We should then do our best to bring them out of their home so that we may group them together with other Christians. By collecting the new ones together from different homes, we can form a group meeting for their perfecting. Eventually we can lead them to attend the larger church meetings.</p>
<p>From now on we should not go out to knock on doors and reach people according to our own way. We must not carry out these four steps in a loose way. No tutor or piano teacher would allow any of the students to use their fingers as they like. The most difficult thing is to instruct the new ones to use their fingers properly. Some of those who play the piano excel as pianists because they were under a strict tutor for at least ten years. Nearly the entire day they sat there and played according to strict instructions. Otherwise, they could not play in a concert. It is the same way in reaching people at their doors. I have heard many places testify of door-knocking, home meetings, and group meetings, but I just shake my head.</p>
<p>What is on my heart is this. As long as we are not overage, we should go out regularly and carry out these four steps exactly as the training instructs. If each of us promises to give two and a half hours a week, eventually we will get into it. When we get into it, we will acquire a taste for it. Then we may even desire to go out twice a week.</p>
<p>Every time the teams come together for fellowship, some brothers will give some instructions and training prior to going out. This going out is a simple matter, but we must learn some spiritual principles. Because our practice of the new way is not that regulated or regular, we may work very much but reap little. So we must change the way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST AND BEARING FRUIT</h2>
<p>Some saints were not happy with door-knocking and the new way. They said that I was too much in activities and that it seemed there was no God, no Lord, and no Spirit. One saint even expressed the feeling that all the saints need to come back to the enjoyment of Christ. Although it is wonderful that we have enjoyed Christ so much, I would like to check, where are the fruits? We may enjoy Christ, but where are the fruits?</p>
<p>To enjoy Christ means to abide in Him. In John 15:5 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo; Without the proper bearing of fruit, our enjoyment is not genuine. There must be something wrong. If a married woman has no children after three or five years, there is something wrong.</p>
<p>Still worse, we may have been Christians for fifteen years, yet we are without fruit. We cannot tolerate this kind of teaching that speaks of the enjoyment of Christ yet without fruit. It is altogether twisted and imbalanced. Rather, we testify that the enjoyment of Christ issues in fruit bearing, and fruit bearing comes out of the enjoyment of Christ. These two things should be here to balance us.</p>
<p>Although we all enjoy Christ, what kind of enjoyment of Christ do we have? This is the problem. The real check of our enjoyment of Christ is by no other way than fruit bearing. The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 12:33 that &ldquo;by the fruit the tree is known&rdquo; (cf. Matt. 7:16-20; Luke 6:43-44).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Lord condemns barrenness in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. In the Old Testament, the Lord condemns physical barrenness (Gen. 30:1-2; Prov. 30:16), whereas in the New Testament, He condemns spiritual barrenness (John 15:2, 6). Thank the Lord that in the New Testament He does not care whether we have physical children or not. Even the Apostle Paul said how good it would be if we did not have children (1 Cor. 7:7-8). However, if we do not have spiritual children, that is a shame.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN LABORING TOGETHER WITH GOD</h2>
<p>The Bible tells us that when man tills the ground, God sends the rain (Gen. 2:5). Suppose that every day the rain comes but no one tills the ground. What can we reap? All farmers know that, on the one hand, they have to till the ground, sow the seed, and water the crop. On the other hand, they must all look to the heavens for the adequate rainfall. This is to &ldquo;make a living by the heavens&rdquo; in the Chinese expression. To look to the heavens does not mean to just go home and sleep day and night. Farmers must go to the field, till the ground, sow the seed, and so forth. Then they will reap something at harvest time.</p>
<p>In the same way, without our labor God would not be able to do any work today. Today is the day of the New Testament, and the New Testament principle is that of incarnation. God must work together with man and in man. If so, then something will happen. Otherwise, nothing will happen. If we merely teach and speak without laboring, how could we expect to gain the fruit? I am looking to the Lord that here in Anaheim and in all the churches a good number will be faithful to rise up and begin to practice the God-ordained way. We will see the difference after one year. Surely each one of us can bring at least two remaining fruit to the Lord each year.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A PRACTICAL CHURCH LIFE<br />
REALIZED IN THE GROUP MEETINGS</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw the need to carry out our priestly service in a regular and diligent way. At this time we want to fellowship concerning the group meetings. Although many of us have been faithful in the church life for years and love the Lord, the results of our labor have not been that satisfactory. This can mainly be proven by our barrenness. When the recovery came to the United States in 1962 and the ministry began to function, there were a good number of the Lord&rsquo;s seekers from the very beginning. These twenty-five to fifty believers were ready and prepared to receive something as the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. At this point they came into the church life.</p>
<p>During the first ten years from 1962 to 1972, the number of saints increased rapidly. However, after 1972 the rate of increase slowed down very much. During those early years, I traveled frequently from the East to the West coast to speak to the seeking ones who had invited me to come. As a result, wherever I went, some were gained by the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. At that time most of them moved to Los Angeles and settled there. So, the increase in the church in Los Angeles was not an increase of local people, but it came from different cities far away.</p>
<p>In 1970 over one hundred saints migrated out to two or three cities. That was quite successful. Everywhere they went, they met groups of seeking ones. Gradually within one year all of these seeking ones were also gained by the recovery. This prevailing increase stirred up the attention of Christianity, but not in a good sense. They became jealous and conspired to damage us. This was the source of all the evil books that were written against us.</p>
<p>After being defamed, we scarcely had any increase. Today the total number of saints in the recovery is still about the same as it was fifteen years ago. Although the number of local churches has increased, the total number of members has not risen that much. In 1974 more than one thousand were meeting in Orange County. Today there are less than one thousand. One church in Orange County went from fifty to one hundred within one year. Today less than one hundred are meeting there.</p>
<p>This bothered me quite deeply. From 1984 I felt that I could not go on in the United States. I had to stop my work here because the results were disappointing. After a number of semi-annual trainings and other conferences, there was still the same number of persons. They all appreciated my ministry but very few new ones were brought in.</p>
<p>During the past five years we passed through many turmoils. The more that I have been attacked and defamed, the more I have the confirmation that what the Lord has shown us is the right way. This is the very thing that the enemy hates. The older and more experienced co-workers among us were quite useful in the first period of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. However, when I began to be used by the Lord to bring in the so-called <em>new way,</em> it did not fit in with their disposition. Due to the disposition of the opposing ones, they do not like the new way. According to his disposition, one of the opposing ones prefers to give messages in the larger meetings and rarely preaches the gospel. Actually, our disposition controls us in every way. We may never have brought one new one to the Lord just because of our disposition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2>
<p>In the past we did not have the time to build the recovery up into a situation that we desired. However, according to our recent five-year study, the Lord has shown us from the Bible the God-ordained way that was never practiced properly among the Christians throughout the centuries. The proper way is the God-ordained way.</p>
<p>This God-ordained way consists of four steps. First, we must practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel (Rom. 15:16). This is not the common gospel preaching found in Christianity today. On the contrary, the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel is for the kingdom of God. Therefore, we must carry it out in a particular and trained way. Of course, the Bible does not tell us everything in detail, but the New Testament does give us clear light and examples concerning the proper preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 says that the Head &ldquo;gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints&rdquo; (vv. 11-12). Not only the apostles, the prophets, and the shepherd-teachers are mentioned here, but the evangelists are mentioned as well. We must realize that the evangelists are also perfecters. The evangelists were given by the Head not only for preaching the gospel directly by themselves but also for perfecting the saints. The evangelists, in turn, should perfect the saints to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Do not think that to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel is an easy thing; it is not so easy. We all need some perfecting. <em>Perfecting</em> indicates that this is not a common thing. Rather, it is something particular. We are not just knocking on doors like the Mormons and Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. We are fulfilling the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. This is not a small thing. We must learn how to be priests. In the Old Testament the priests began their training as apprentices at twenty-five years of age. They learned under a certain period of training for five years. At the age of thirty, they began to carry out their full responsibility as priests (Num. 4:3; cf. Luke 3:23). Their duties included burning the incense and offering many kinds of offerings. Each offering had its own laws and regulations (Lev. 6&mdash;7). In particular, there were many regulations concerning the peace offering (Lev. 7:11-21). We must realize that the New Testament priests are just priests of the gospel (Rom. 15:16). To preach the gospel is to go to contact people and visit them (John 15:16). No one can deny this principle.</p>
<p>Second, we must nourish and cherish the new ones like babies under the care of a nourishing mother. Feeding is only needed three or five times a day, but cherishing lasts all day long. For example, when the weather is cold, a mother puts more clothing on her little child. When the temperature is hot, she removes some of the baby&rsquo;s clothes. If the child is crying, the mother knows how to calm down her little one. A mother also knows how to make so many things pleasant for her unhappy child. This is to cherish. The Apostle Paul said that he was such a nourishing mother and also an exhorting father (1 Thes. 2:7, 11).</p>
<p>The third step involves the perfecting of the saints in the group meetings. The perfecting is clearly revealed in Ephesians 4. The last step is that all the saints must learn to prophesy. The entire chapter of 1 Corinthians 14 deals with this one thing, that is, speaking forth the Lord to minister Him to others that they may be nourished, edified, and built up. As a result, the Body of Christ will be directly built up by everyone prophesying (v. 26). This God-ordained way is here in the Bible, and no one can deny it. According to His principle, there must be a way to work out whatever the Lord says to us in His Word.</p>
<p>One brother from the church in Seoul, Korea, recently told us that in 1985 they began to meet with seventeen saints in a small section of that large city of twelve to fourteen million people. That section of the city now has over three hundred meeting together. He told us that they just practice according to whatever I speak.</p>
<p>As we are burdened to take the new way, we should consecrate ourselves to the Lord and have a time with the Lord each morning in order to be revived. This should be followed by a daily practice of overcoming. Furthermore, we must practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel by going out to visit people. After much study, I found out that we do not need to knock on that many &ldquo;cold doors&rdquo; because we have too many &ldquo;warm doors&rdquo; already. We have many relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates.</p>
<p>As ones who love the Lord, we should take care of our relatives and neighbors. By visiting them we can bring them to be saved and baptized. After a week we may gain others. At this point we may be caring for four different new ones. Instead of baptizing more, it is best to return to them to have home meetings in their homes. This requires nourishing them first along with a great deal of cherishing. We can then bring these three or four together to form a small group.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONTENTS AND PRACTICE<br />
OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The most crucial step in carrying out the God-ordained way is to have group meetings. This meeting can begin by having all of the attendants open up. This enables us to know each other and brings in fellowship. This fellowship will lead us into interceding prayer for each other. This kind of mutual prayer will usher us into practical care for one another. This is what the Apostle Paul means in Hebrews 10:24 when he said, &ldquo;Let us consider one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One saint may fellowship that he has been jobless for two weeks and is looking for work. Another brother may speak up and tell him that he will approach his boss to see if his company is hiring anyone at this time. This kind of care can be rendered in a group meeting. Whenever the saints gather together for a group meeting, the first thing that they should take care of is fellowship. Then intercession, care, and shepherding should follow.</p>
<p>During the meeting a number of questions may be raised. Each question should be answered. We must realize that we all can answer the questions. Each answer is a kind of teaching. There is no need to assign one of the attendants to be the teacher of the group meeting. Everyone is a teacher.</p>
<p>When we bring the new ones together to form a small group, one may be there who was recently baptized. This one may bring up the matter of what it is to be baptized. Others in the meeting who may have been baptized only two weeks earlier may have learned some truth by that time. They may reply that baptism is just to be put into the death of Christ. This is a kind of teaching. Even from the very beginning all of the new ones can learn to teach. When we teach, others can learn.</p>
<p>Although the new ones can teach, they cannot teach that much. So, one who is more mature among that group may want to give a concluding word. At the beginning of the meeting we should allow time for the new ones to practice learning to speak. Then, later on, we may speak for fifteen minutes. It is in this way that everyone will be a teacher. From the very beginning everyone&rsquo;s talent and everyone&rsquo;s gift will be manifested, developed, and perfected. As a result many teachers will be produced among us.</p>
<p>Following this, we should endeavor to bring them into the practice of the church life. We can charge them to go and visit people in the same way that we reached out to them. We may go out with them and bring them one by one into the same practice. Eventually, this small group becomes our practical church life. It is a miniature of the church in which we are. Actually, the church life will be carried out practically in the group meeting.</p>
<p>In a larger meeting of, for example, two hundred, we can only do things in a general way and give a general word of fellowship. All of the detailed items of the church life, however, should be carried out in the group meetings. The fellowship, the intercession, the mutual care, the shepherding, and the teaching will all be realized in the group meeting. Then the entire church will be brought on through the small groups. In a church of two hundred saints, there may be twenty groups of ten or twelve who can even do a more thorough work than the elders. If a church desires a continual increase, they must make use of the groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO HAVE OUR OWN GROUP MEETING</h2>
<p>My main burden is that all of us need to have our own group meeting. In Hebrews 10:25 the Apostle Paul told the saints not to forsake the assembling of themselves together. We may forget everything, but we should not forget our own group meeting. All of the mothers know that they could never forget their own children. If we would take care of a group meeting in this way, the church where we are will be a great success.</p>
<p>In particular, the older sisters among us should pray in a definite way to become involved in their own group meeting. They can pray for this group as a whole and for each new member by name. The sisters must pray particularly for each group member a few times each day. Our prayer must lay the tracks for the locomotive to run on. So we must not pray in a general way but in a particular way.</p>
<p>Because we labored in a general way in the past, we do not have the adequate fruit. Today we must first concentrate our effort to bring a few new ones to be baptized. The second step is to have home meetings with them in order that they may be cherished and nourished. In a short while we can group them together to form a group meeting of two or three. As I have indicated previously, the most important thing today is to have our own group meeting. This can be considered as our own assembly (Heb. 10:25).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROUP MEETINGS FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The group meeting is really a means for the increase. Therefore, no group meeting should remain for a long time with the same number. Every group meeting should be subdivided into two groups within one year. This is the way to increase. For example, at the beginning of the year we may have baptized two or three. We can work on them in the home meetings and gradually bring them together to form a group meeting. In this way the group meeting will grow. All of the new ones will learn to do the same things that we do. By the end of the year, this group will be ready to be divided into two groups. However, in many places those who are grouped together are not willing to be divided. In a sense they fell in love with one another and wish to remain in the old group. This is absolutely wrong. In the new way one group at the end of the year will become two groups. Then at the end of the next year, there will be four groups. This is equivalent to a one hundred percent increase yearly. Just by practicing the new way for one year, everybody will learn. Hence, everyone can be a leader. The groups themselves will produce the leaders. We all have to learn this new way and not delay any further. If within one year there is no fruit, no learning, and no new groups, we have wasted one year. Then it will be difficult to be rescued out of this situation.</p>
<p>The longer the groups remain together, the less they can do and the less useful they will be. Not only should we see new ones coming in regularly among us, but we should also see new group meetings year after year.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP THE GROUP MEETINGS PARTICULARLY AND DEFINITELY</h1>
<p>In the previous messages we have seen that the church service is primarily composed of five main things. The first item is the proper gospel preaching. In addition, we must study the truth and seek after the truth; we must have a thorough knowledge of the Bible. Third, there is the need of the adequate growth in life. Fourth, there must be a strong children&rsquo;s work built up among us. Fifth, our church service must include the student work. Our work among the young people includes the elementary, junior high, high school, and college-age levels. Our church service, then, must consist of the gospel, the truth, life, the children&rsquo;s work, and the student work. Among us, not one of these basic aspects of church service has adequately been built up because our church practice was too general and too much in tradition. We have been holding on to our old ways and practices year after year.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT GENERAL BUT PARTICULAR</h2>
<p>We must all pick up a definite burden to be the New Testament priests of the gospel to take the Lord&rsquo;s new way. When we begin to practice the Lord&rsquo;s new way, we should not carry it out in a general way. Rather, we must consider that this is a particular matter. In the same way, when we attend school, we enroll in a particular field of study. We cannot study a particular field according to our knowledge, our way, our likes or dislikes, or our habit. Rather, we pursue a course of study according to the school&rsquo;s regulations and instruction. If so, we will receive the benefit. We may consider the practice of the new way as our enrollment into a new school. We must forget about all the old ways in the church life and not take anything for granted. If we do mean business with the Lord to take the God-ordained new way, we should practice it regularly and consistently. We need to not do too much or too little, but we must have a schedule; we must have a particular schedule. It would be very helpful if we would make a definite decision and pray, &ldquo;Lord, for Your new way I offer to You three hours of my time per week, either in the afternoon or evening.&rdquo; To some extent we all should have done this already.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING CONSISTENTLY</h2>
<p>It is not necessary for the older saints among us, particularly the older sisters, to go out too much. They can stay at home to pray for the teams. The sisters should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I give You three hours every week. I cannot go out that often, but I do have a burden to pray for the new way.&rdquo; Not only so, the sisters should pray for a particular team. In this way they become co-laborers. While the team labors in going out, the sisters stay at home and labor in prayer. Every week the sisters should keep their vow before the Lord to separate at least two or three hours for the purpose of praying. We must pray particularly, definitely, and regularly.</p>
<p>All of us know that students at school must learn to study in a regular way. No student can successfully finish his schooling by studying one night until midnight and not studying at all for the next few days. He needs to receive the proper instruction. Therefore, he must faithfully do his homework for two hours each day. By studying a few hours a day in a regular way, he will surely be a top student.</p>
<p>Those who go out to visit people should go in a regular way, according to their vow to the Lord. We should make this a kind of habit. As the descendants of Adam, we are all the same. One day our wife may make us very happy. Due to this we are more than excited to go out. We pray and become filled with the Spirit and go out rejoicing. Another day we decide to go out visiting, but a few minutes before we go, our wife does something to make us unhappy. So we decide not to go. Whether we are happy or unhappy, up or down, we must endeavor to keep our vow to the Lord. No appointment, friends, telephone calls, or even the weather should stop us from going out. If we are not consistent in our going out, our labor will never be successful. We must have an attitude that we will not be disappointed. If we do not gain anyone this week, then we will go out next week just the same. A carpenter who does his carpentry work in a regular way will soon produce a coffee table or a chair. However, with many of the dear saints, their good reports and testimonies are like pieces of wood piled up, but where is the furniture?</p>
<p>There is no need to baptize too many. We need to baptize only four or five the whole year. However, every week we must have two or three newly-baptized ones under our care. This should be our practice all year. Then, as in rearing our own children, we can teach them particularly and regularly. Unless we practice the new way regularly, the Lord has no way. Our going out must be in a discerning way. We should discern whether to visit our relatives first, our neighbors, or our classmates. As long as we have some &ldquo;warm doors,&rdquo; there is no need to approach the &ldquo;cold doors.&rdquo; After we enter their home and have a chance to talk, we should exercise our discernment to determine whether or not to spend more time with them. We should not baptize in a blind way, and we need not baptize too many. Within one month&rsquo;s time, by going out once a week for three hours, we can baptize two. After baptizing them, we must consider them as our babes because we are the delivering mother. Following this we must cherish them and nourish them by going back to hold regular meetings with them in their homes. In this way surely one or two will be ready to be brought to the church meetings. Although at the beginning they may not understand that much, we should let them taste a little bit of what the church life is. Meanwhile, we should explain things and give them some instructions. By taking care of them in this way all year, two saints will be produced by our work and brought into the church life each year. Then everyone will bring two definite, remaining fruit into the church life. In a church of two hundred forty saints, four hundred will be meeting together after one year. We must take care of the new ones starting with the home meeting, then passing through the group meeting, and perhaps after one year reaching the prophesying meeting. We will train them to do the same thing as we do, that is, to go out to visit people with the gospel to have home meetings. They will just repeat our work. This is to be perfected unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). Then we will see the growth and increase of the church.</p>
<p>We must change our concept and see that we do not need to labor that much. Every morning we should spend a short time with the Lord to be revived. We must practice this every morning regardless of how busy we are. We can spend at least half a minute in the morning with the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You. Be with me for this whole day, and bless whatever I do for You. I praise You, Lord.&rdquo; Yes, this is too short. But to say this makes us quite different from when we do not say this. Even in this way we will be revived for that entire day. By living with the Lord, we will enjoy a daily victory. There is no need to worry or be that burdened. By practicing this according to the trained way, we will bear solid, remaining fruit. We must be practical, definite, particular, and regular.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXERCISE OF THE ELDERS<br />
TO BE DEFINITE AND PARTICULAR</h2>
<p>The elders in the church must especially exercise themselves that the Lord may lead them to pick up a particular part in the church service. They should not do things independently of the Body, but in fellowship. For example, concerning the group meetings, one among the elders may pick up a burden to build up a new small group or an existing group. First, the elders must learn how to bring that group particularly into the new way and on the right track by the proper steps. They must render definite help. To labor in a general way is just a waste of time; that will not accomplish anything. It all depends upon our understanding and determination. If we do mean business to serve the Lord with some success, we must learn to labor particularly and regularly. We should not exhaust ourselves one day and then do nothing for three days. We should not be influenced or affected by the environment. Rather, we should be definite, particular, and regular. In doing anything, we must do it in a proper way. We must do things according to what we have learned through training.</p>
<p>We have to take the building up of our group meeting as our goal. We must build up our group meeting, starting from knocking on doors and getting people baptized. Then, we can go on to have home meetings with the newly-saved and baptized ones. Following this, we must build up a group meeting. Maybe one-third of the saints in the church actively participate in the Lord&rsquo;s new move, leaving two-thirds who are still not involved. Because of this we must endeavor to bring them in one by one in a gradual way. We should not do too much at one time. We may be burdened to contact a certain saint, but we have to discern if this is the best time for us to contact him. We must always do things with the proper discernment. Gradually, after one month&rsquo;s time we may bring one saint into our group meeting who has not been meeting in one of our small groups before. If we would just be faithful to do this, in one year one person could bring eight to ten dormant saints into the group meetings. If ten of us would do the same thing, then by the end of the next year, everyone would be in a group meeting. Ten of us could bring in eighty. It is not too hard. We may say that it is difficult for us to bring one existing saint into the group meeting every month. However, we can surely bring one saint into a group meeting within three months. So, within one year we could still bring in four. If eighty active saints would each bring in four, then in one year&rsquo;s time, three hundred twenty saints will be brought into these groups.</p>
<p>In the eldership, everything must be carried out in a particular way; everything must be definite. Among the sisters there may be no particular arrangements made to prepare the Lord&rsquo;s table. If so, when the Lord&rsquo;s Day comes, there may be no bread and wine for the saints to partake of. The sisters who prepare the bread and cup must be regular. Whether they have a difficult time with their husband or not, it should not change anything. They must do their duty regularly. If we all hold this kind of attitude with such a proper spirit, we will succeed in our labor and service to the Lord.</p></body></html>
