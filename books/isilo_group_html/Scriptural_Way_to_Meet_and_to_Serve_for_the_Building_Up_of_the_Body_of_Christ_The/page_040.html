<p>Revelation 2:17 says, &ldquo;I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.&rdquo; If we eat Jesus in a hidden way as the hidden manna, we will grow and be transformed into a &ldquo;white stone.&rdquo; A &ldquo;stone&rdquo; in the Bible signifies material for God&rsquo;s building (Matt. 16:18; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:12). In our natural being we are not stones, but clay. Because we have received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply (2 Cor. 3:18). If we do not follow the worldly church, but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life, we will be transformed into stones for the building of God. God&rsquo;s building, the building of the church, depends upon our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST AS A FEAST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Overcome Lukewarmness</h2>
<p>Revelation 3:20 speaks of enjoying Christ as a feast. This is the Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Laodicea, which had become lukewarm. The lukewarm saints are very self-contented, so they have become proud. The best way to help these saints overcome their lukewarmness is to help them open their hearts to the Lord in order to let the Lord come in to dine, to feast, with them (Rev. 3:20). To feast with the Lord is to eat Jesus in a richer way, like the children of Israel enjoying the rich produce of the good land of Canaan, which included many items. All the riches of the good land were their enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Gain the Faith in Christ, the White Garments,<br />
and the Eyesalve</h2>
<p>To overcome lukewarmness is to gain the faith in Christ, the white garments, and the eyesalve. The Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Laodicea in Revelation 3:18 is to buy from Him &ldquo;gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.&rdquo; Our working faith (Gal. 5:6) is likened to &ldquo;gold&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:7). &ldquo;White garments&rdquo; refer to conduct approved by the Lord, which is the Lord Himself lived out of the church. The &ldquo;eyesalve&rdquo; needed to &ldquo;anoint&rdquo; their eyes refers to the anointing Spirit (1 John 2:27), who is the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The enjoyment of Christ as a feast (Rev. 3:20) will cause us to gain the faith in Christ, the white garments, and the eyesalve (3:18). As we experience Christ in such a way, we recover our faith in Christ signified by the gold, the Lord Himself is our approved conduct signified by the white garments, and we receive our sight to see the deep things of God and the spiritual things concerning Christ indicated by the eyesalve.</p>
<p>The people of God in the Old Testament were supposed to eat the tree of life in the garden, they ate the hidden manna in the wilderness, and they enjoyed the good land with all of its riches as a feast. Today we can enjoy Christ as the reality of the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast. When we enjoy Christ in all these ways, we will be nourished and fully supplied with the riches of Christ. Then when we come together, we will have something to speak about, something to offer. The riches of Christ will be exhibited in our meetings, issuing in the Body of Christ. The exhibition of the riches of Christ will produce, increase, or enlarge the Body of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
