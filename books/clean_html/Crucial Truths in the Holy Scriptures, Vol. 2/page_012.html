<h2 class="head2">The Laying On of Hands for Sending Out</h2>
<p>The fifth kind of laying on of hands is the laying on of hands to send some out for the work, so it is the laying on of hands for sending out. The laying on of hands for appointment causes the recipients to receive a service within a church; the laying on of hands for sending out causes the recipient to go out into the work.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;When they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:3).</p>
<p>In the early church in Antioch, there were five prophets and teachers, three of whom laid hands on the other two in order to send them out to do the work to which God had called them. This kind of laying on of hands for sending out also has the purpose of joining and fellowship. The three who laid their hands on the two indicated that they were one with the two as they went out to do the work for God. They were joined to the two and had fellowship with them. When the two went out, the three also went with them. Although the three could not go out with them physically, they went with them in spirit through the laying on of hands. We must firmly grasp this principle, and we should imitate this practice. Every time some brothers receive a calling from God or are sent out for the work, we should be joined to them and have fellowship with them; their going should be the entire church&rsquo;s going. The entire church, through its representatives, lays its hands on those going out in order to be joined to them and to go out with them. This kind of laying on of hands in the church is not an empty ritual; rather, it is a spiritual reality that causes the recipients of the laying on of hands to be supplied by the whole church in their service to God so that they would not be alone or act individualistically. Under the proper conditions, this kind of laying on of hands causes the recipients to receive the Lord&rsquo;s blessing and the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The preceding five kinds of laying on of hands are all related to the Body of Christ. Although their outward function is somewhat different, their inward meaning is the same. Whether it be the laying on of hands for acceptance, for receiving of the Holy Spirit, for the impartation of spiritual gifts, for appointment, or for sending out, the inward meaning is always joining and fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Laying On of Hands for Blessing</h2>
<p>The sixth kind of laying on of hands is for blessing, which causes people to be blessed through the laying on of hands.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Taking them into His arms, He fervently blessed them, laying His hands on them&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 10:16; see also Gen. 48:14-16).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He laid His hands on the little children and blessed them. In the Old Testament Jacob laid his hands on his grandchildren and blessed them. This also implies fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Laying On of Hands for Healing</h2>
<p>There is yet another kind of laying on of hands, which causes people to be healed, so it is the laying on of hands for healing.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 4:40).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He laid His hands on many sick people to heal them.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;They will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 16:18).</p>
<p>After the Lord Jesus ascended into the heavens, the disciples also laid their hands on people to heal them.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Paul went in to him, and having prayed and laid his hands on him, healed him&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 28:8).</p>
<p>Paul laid his hands on people to heal them. This kind of laying on of hands for healing also has the meaning of fellowship because it gives the sick one the gift of healing through fellowship with the one laying on his hands; this heals the sick one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CAUTION IN THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Lay hands quickly on no man, nor participate in others&rsquo; sins; keep yourself pure&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 5:22).</p>
<p>Since the laying on of hands joins people in fellowship, if someone is sinful and unclean, the person laying on his hands would participate in the other&rsquo;s sinfulness and uncleanness. Therefore, when we lay hands on people, we must be cautious and not act too quickly lest we participate in the sins of others. For the sake of keeping ourselves pure, we must discern before we lay hands on him whether the person whom we intend to lay our hands on has rejected sin and dealt clearly with evil before God and man. If he has not, we should not lay our hands on him.</p>
