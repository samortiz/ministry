   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN SEEKING AND RESTORING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DORMANT SAINTS Scripture Reading: Luke 15:4-6, 8-9, 20-23 STIRRING UP AN ATMOSPHERE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO RESTORE THE DORMANT SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although Hymns, #471 speaks of a saint returning to the Lord, we rarely sing this hymn because we have neglected the matter of restoring the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I wrote this hymn at the start of the work in Taiwan because I felt a need to help the saints who were weak, backslidden, or cold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I used this hymn to stir up an atmosphere to help the weak ones and restore the backslidden ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we first arrived in Taiwan, we did not have an atmosphere of preaching the gospel, studying the truth, and pursuing the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We also did not have an atmosphere of taking care of people or serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we felt that we needed to stir up such an atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Stirring Up an Atmosphere</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>in the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today people in the world do things systematically, and the best systems are based on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible comes from God, and its principles are known and used by many.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, the American founding fathers were influenced by the Puritans, who revered God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>America is a strong and prosperous country because many of its governmental systems are based on principles found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The concept of democracy practiced in America is rooted in principles spoken of in both the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Old Testament God commanded Moses to tell the Israelites not to rule over their brothers with severity so as to annul their rights Lev 25:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament the Gospel of Luke speaks of recovering human rights through the jubilee 4:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After God s people entered the good land of Canaan, God allotted a portion of land to each tribe and to each family, each household Num 33:53-54 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a man sold his possession but did not have sufficient means to restore it himself, then in the year of jubilee, he could return to his possession.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, there was no possibility of an Israelite possessing large amounts of land in perpetuity Lev 25:8-17, 23-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the jubilee arrived every fifty years, a trumpet was sounded v. 9 , and the land sold to another Israelite would no longer belong to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible does not say that the land was returned to the original owner; rather, it says that each of you shall return to his possession v. 10 . This is a recovering of human rights.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A man may have sold his land and may have even fallen into the pitiful condition of selling himself into slavery, but according to God s ordination, he was no longer a slave as soon as the trumpet sounded and the jubilee arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both he and his master instantly became equal before God, and the man who sold his land could return to his dwelling and possession.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, every fifty years, land ownership among the Israelites was reallocated and balanced out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a marvelous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today many excellent systems and principles in human communities are based on the Bible, and the highest ethical and moral standards and regulations are found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God moves, He begins by stirring up an atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the case of the jubilee this stirring up was accomplished by sounding the trumpet throughout the land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even when the Israelites left Egypt and followed Moses, they moved according to the blowing of silver trumpets Num 10:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In their journey with Moses, they never stayed in one place very long because a long encampment would cause them to be slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Israelites moved by listening for the blowing of two silver trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sounding trumpets stirred up an atmosphere in preparation for the move of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Stirring Up an Atmosphere in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Old Testament the blowing of trumpets stirred up an atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Testament the atmosphere was first stirred up by John the Baptist Matt 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the Lord Jesus 4:17 , the twelve disciples Mark 3:14-19 , the seventy disciples Luke 10:1 , and the one hundred twenty disciples stirred up an atmosphere Acts 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today an atmosphere of the gospel has been stirred up in the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1949, when I came to Taipei to start the work, I felt that the first thing we needed to do was to stir up an atmosphere of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>STIRRING UP AN ATMOSPHERE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN THE INITIAL STAGE IN TAIPEI Distributing Tracts, Printing Posters,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>and Sending Out Teams</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to stir up an atmosphere of the gospel in Taipei in our initial stage, we determined the population of Taipei and then printed and distributed gospel tracts so that every resident in Taipei could receive one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In our practice we did not act on impulse, passing out tracts in a random way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, we were not superstitious, thinking that with prayer alone the wind would blow and carry our tracts to every household.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We asked the saints to come together and look at the map of the city of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we divided the city into small districts, studied the situation of every street, and decided which brothers and sisters should be responsible for the district.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After receiving the tracts, the brothers and sisters placed them in mailboxes, going from house to house, covering the streets assigned to them so that every resident of the city would receive a gospel tract.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This stirred up a gospel atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Next we printed posters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We used four colors: red, yellow, blue, and green to prepare posters with words such as Believe in Jesus and be saved, Jesus Christ came to the world to save sinners, and God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we placed these posters at train stations, bus stations, crossroads, important intersections, and on the front doors of the saints homes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way, people who were walking on the streets of Taipei could identify the homes of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the number of believers increased, the city of Taipei was filled with these posters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We also sent out gospel teams.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Gospel teams were first used in Shanghai, and we often had more than eight hundred on a team that would march through Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the team reached the Bund, a major downtown district in Shanghai, we would shout with a loud voice, Oh, Shanghai!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Repent quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If your sins do not go, peace cannot come.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This stirred up a gospel atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we started our work in Taipei, we strengthened the gospel teams, which were sent out in several ways.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One team would go out on a regular basis in the evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>With lanterns in their hands, the teams would go through the streets and small alleys shouting slogans, such as Repent! and Believe in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Another team would leave from hall one on the Lord s Day afternoon, divide into four groups, and walk toward New Park.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We would walk according to the beating of drums and sing, You need Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You need Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>/ Men and women all need Him!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>/ For redemption you need Him, / For salvation you need Him!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>/ And for everlasting life, / Yes, you need Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hymns, #1024 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The four groups would take different routes and enter the park through its four gates.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As we paraded through the streets, we gathered people into the park.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>People would stream in from all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>New Park has over a thousand seats, and they were immediately filled.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When everyone arrived, we would begin to sing hymns and preach a gospel message.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This was how we stirred up an atmosphere in those days.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After gospel tracts were distributed and every street was saturated with gospel posters, people were easily attracted by the beating of the gospel drums on the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Every Lord s Day we would go to New Park to preach the gospel, and in the afternoon we would come back with four to five hundred names.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We did this continuously for one to two years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>During this time, quite a number were saved and some even became responsible brothers in different churches.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We also had a meeting every Monday evening for saints who were burdened to visit the ones who had given us their names.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We distributed these names to the saints, and they would go to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This practice brought in an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and many people were deeply impressed with the gospel.</S>
