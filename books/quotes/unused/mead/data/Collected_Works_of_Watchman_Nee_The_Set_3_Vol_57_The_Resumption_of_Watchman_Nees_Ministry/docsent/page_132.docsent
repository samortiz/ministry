   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANING AND THE SPHERE OF THE CHURCH The Two Aspects of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Witness Lee: What is the meaning and the sphere of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman Nee: There are two meanings to the word church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is the universal church, and the second is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The universal church is the general church, which includes the church of yesterday and today, both here and elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It even includes the church in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The local church is the church that appears in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Two Aspects of the Universal Church</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are two aspects to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One aspect refers to the church that includes all of God's children both yesterday and today, both here and everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we have to realize that today we are neither in yesterday nor in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's children are living on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When all these children of God are added together, we also have the general church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What was there yesterday is past, and what will be there in the future is not here yet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Between the past and the future, there are all the children of God on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's children must not only practice the oneness in the locality, but they must learn to be one with all God's children on the whole earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Maintaining the Local Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and God's Testimony on Earth As Well</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Nanking develops a problem with Shanghai, that is, if the church in Nanking is at odds with the church in Shanghai, you can only say that they are maintaining a local testimony; they have not maintained God's testimony on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must not only maintain a local testimony; we must also maintain God's testimony on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot isolate Shanghai and try to keep it out of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Shanghai belongs to the general church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Body spoken of in 1 Corinthians is different from the Body spoken of in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Body in Ephesians 4 includes all the believers past and present, here and everywhere, but the Body in 1 Corinthians only refers to all the believers on earth at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Learning to Be One</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is local, whereas the work is regional.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A local church cannot encompass the work of a region, because a region involves more than one local church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, all the local churches plus all the regional works equal the general church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order for us to practice the oneness of the church, we must practice the oneness of the general church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This requires that we learn to follow others and learn to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH The Authority of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being with the Elders, whereas the Authority</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>of the Work Being with the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Witness Lee: What is the authority of the church, and who can represent the church?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Watchman Nee: The authority of the local church is in the hands of the elders, whereas the authority of the work is in the hands of the apostles.</S>
