<h1 class="title">SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF SERVICE</h2>
<p>Our service to God can be divided into service that is according to revelation or service that is natural. Service according to revelation involves meeting God, being shined upon by God, receiving revelation from God, and being burdened in spirit by God. This kind of service is not initiated by us but by God; it is not out of ourselves but out of God. We must meet God and contact God in order to have service that comes from God as the source.</p>
<p>Natural service is different. Natural service is according to our own ideas, views, traditions, or regulations. It also comes from copying or imitating others, and it is often initiated to simply meet the need of a certain situation. Such service comes out of ourselves or out of others but not out of God. This kind of service does not require us to meet God or contact God; it is service that we can do apart from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF SAUL</h2>
<p>Before Saul received revelation, he thought that he was serving God (Acts 7:58; 8:1). Before he was saved, he was trained at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strictness of the Judaic law, and he was zealous for God (22:3). In his zealousness he persecuted Christians and thought that he was serving God (vv. 4-5). The Lord Jesus spoke of this kind of service when He said to His disciples, &ldquo;An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God&rdquo; (John 16:2). Saul killed Christians and thought that he was serving God. He did not know that he was resisting the Lord, opposing the Lord, and kicking against the goads (Acts 26:14). Instead, he thought that he was being zealous in his service to God. He had zeal but no light. His service was not according to revelation but according to the law, a service according to the Old Testament and Judaic traditions. He was zealous in his service, but he had no revelation. Until light from heaven flashed around him on his way to Damascus (9:3), he was unaware of his condition, but after the flashing of the light, he knew that he had been zealously but blindly serving God (vv. 8-9, 17-18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF PAUL</h2>
<p>After the flashing of the light, his service as Paul was wholly according to revelation. In Galatians 1:11-12 Paul says that the gospel he announced was &ldquo;not according to man&rdquo; but that he had &ldquo;received it through a revelation by Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In 2:1-2 Paul also says that he went up to Jerusalem &ldquo;according to revelation.&rdquo; After the shining from heaven on the way to Damascus, Paul&rsquo;s service was different. Previously, his service had been according to tradition; it was copied and learned. Hence, it was natural. After his experience, his service was the result of meeting God and receiving God&rsquo;s shining. His service was according to revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION</h2>
<p>Everyone who serves the Lord must be clear that the only service that counts before God is service according to revelation. All our service should be according to revelation. Certainly service involving big matters must be according to revelation, but even the seemingly small service of visiting brothers and sisters should be according to revelation. Furthermore, what we say to the brothers and sisters should be according to revelation; it should not be routine or natural. We need revelation concerning what to say, and we need revelation concerning how we should speak. We should not copy or imitate the way others speak, but instead we should speak according to revelation. The only service that is of value is service that is done according to revelation.</p>
<p>The most important matter in a person&rsquo;s serving of the Lord is revelation. Every act of our service should come out of revelation. We should not have outward acts of service to the Lord without inward revelation from the Lord. Our inward revelation must govern our outward acts. If we act according to an outward situation without any inward revelation, our service will only be natural.</p>
<p>Service according to revelation requires light. For example, visiting the brothers and sisters must be the result of fellowship with the Lord, in which the Lord burdens us and gives us a sense that a certain brother or sister needs to be visited. When we spend time with the Lord, and He burdens us in regard to a brother or sister, this sense will govern our actions.</p>
<p>Not only should our visitation be according to revelation, but all our service should be according to revelation. Preaching the gospel should be according to revelation. We should not join the gospel work of the church simply because we hear an announcement from the brothers. We should join the gospel work because we have contacted the Lord and received an inward burden. When we draw near to the Lord and fellowship with Him, we may be touched that just as the Lord has revived us and treasures us, He has this same regard for others. If we have such an inward sense, this revelation will govern our preaching of the gospel. Such service is according to revelation.</p>
<p>Service according to revelation results from drawing near to the Lord and having fellowship with Him. It comes from being touched by Him in our inward feelings and sensing His desire related to a certain matter. When we carry out this desire, our service comes out of the Lord&rsquo;s shining and revelation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
