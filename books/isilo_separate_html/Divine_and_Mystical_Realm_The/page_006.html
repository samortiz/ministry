It is not a correction nor merely an outward change; it is an inward metabolism by having more of the element of the divine life added to the believers for the outward expression-Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>			<li>Building up-the believers&#8217; growth in the divine life and their being joined together with other believers in the divine life (Eph. 4:15-16). Renewing issues in transformation, and transformation issues in building up. This is fully proven by the wall with its foundations of the New Jerusalem. The wall of the New Jerusalem is of jasper, expressing the appearance of God (Rev. 4:3). While the jasper stones were being transformed, they were joined together and built up into a wall.</li>			<li>Conformation-to be conformed to the full-grown image of the firstborn Son of God, who is the first God-man, as the prototype for mass reproduction. He is God mingled with man and man mingled with God to live a God-man living that expresses all the attributes of God as human virtues for the expression of the divine glory in humanity, whose ultimate consummation, whose maturity in the divine life, is the New Jerusalem-Rom. 8:29; 1:4; Eph. 4:14; Rev. 21.</li>			<li>Glorification-to be saturated with the divine glory from within in the maturity of the divine life and to be glorified from without by and with the divine glory as the finalization of God&#8217;s judicial redemption of the believers&#8217; body and the top portion of the divine sonship in God&#8217;s organic salvation-Rom. 8:30; Heb. 2:10; Phil. 3:21; Eph. 4:30; Rom. 8:23.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>We must be reminded all the time that Christ accomplishes God&#8217;s organic salvation not by Himself as the Christ in the flesh but by Himself as the Spirit.</li>	<li>We also have to remember that all the items of God&#8217;s organic salvation are carried out not by Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry judicially and objectively but by His heavenly ministry organically and subjectively.</li>	</ol></li></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
