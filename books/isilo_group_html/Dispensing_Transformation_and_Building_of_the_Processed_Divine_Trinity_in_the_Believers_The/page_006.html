In this mingling God&#8217;s element increases more and more in man. When God&#8217;s element increases in man, man in the condition of the old creation will be gradually renewed and transformed until he becomes completely the new creation. What is the new creation? The new creation is just God Himself. In this universe, only God is &#8220;new&#8221; and everything else is &#8220;old.&#8221; Every person, thing, and matter in the universe is old and is becoming old every day. Only our God is &#8220;new&#8221;; He is ever new and never becomes old. Therefore, when we have this God, we become the new creation. God does not want us to change ourselves, to make ourselves new. God wants us to receive Him, be filled and saturated with Him, and be permeated by Him, that we may have a metabolic change.<p>Christians know and accept the matter of God becoming a man. However, concerning man becoming God, they consider this as something incredible. Some brothers and sisters might have heard and declared this, but within them they may have a question mark concerning it. What! Man becoming God? It seems that this is heresy. The revelation concerning man becoming God is unacceptable to many Christians. However, in church history, during the time of the church fathers, the truth concerning God becoming man that man may become God was generally accepted by the saints. But not long afterward the church was distracted from the vision concerning this truth and the economy of God and became more and more degraded. Hence, today when we speak about man becoming God, people generally feel uncomfortable with it and find it difficult to accept. Today our mind needs to be transformed by being renewed that we may see this truth revealed in the Bible. God became man that man may become God. What a miracle this is! What a mystery this is! Although our mind cannot comprehend it, we need to simply receive it, and then we will be able to enjoy and experience this fact as our reality.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Dispensing, Transformation and Building of the Processed Divine Trinity in the Believers &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
