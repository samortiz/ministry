<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Southern Kingdom of Judah<br>Also Committing Fornication</H2><P>Israel's treacherous sister, the southern kingdom of Judah, saw what Israel did and what happened to her. However, Judah did not fear but went and committed fornication also (vv. 7-8). Judah saw that her sister was punished for the evil thing she did, but Judah did not learn from this. Rather, she followed Israel to do the same thing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Treacherous Southern Kingdom of Judah<br>Not Returning to Jehovah with All Her Heart</H2><P>In spite of all this, the treacherous southern kingdom of Judah did not return to Jehovah with all her heart, but instead falsely (v. 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Jehovah Saying to Jeremiah<br>That Israel the Apostate<br>Has Shown Herself to Be More Righteous<br>Than Judah the Treacherous</H2><P>In verse 11 Jehovah said to Jeremiah that Israel the apostate has shown herself to be more righteous than Judah the treacherous. Israel was better than Judah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. ISRAEL THE WIFE'S RETURN&#151;<br>A LOVING PLEADING OF JEHOVAH THE HUSBAND</H2><P>Jeremiah 3:12&#151;4:2 covers Israel the wife's return&#151;a loving pleading of Jehovah the Husband. What we have here is not Israel's actual return but the aspiration of Jehovah the Husband for her to return.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Sending His Prophet<br>to Ask Israel, His Apostate Wife,<br>to Return and Acknowledge Her Iniquity</H2><P>Jehovah sent His prophet to call to the north (referring to Assyria, to which Israel was captured) and ask Israel, His apostate wife, to return and acknowledge her iniquity&#151;her transgression against Him in turning to strange gods under every flourishing tree (vv. 12-13).</P>
