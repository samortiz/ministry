   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and Rebellious Son</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 21:18-21 there is a word regarding the judgment on a stubborn and rebellious son.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>and Bringing Him Forth to the Elders of Their City</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a man had a stubborn and rebellious son, who did not listen to the voice of his parents, even though they chastised him, then his parents were to seize him and bring him forth to the elders of their city and to the gate of their place vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>18-19 .</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It would have been very difficult for the parents of a stubborn and rebellious son to bring him to the elders of their city and then to see him stoned to death.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To allow such an evil one to remain among the people would have been a damage to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the evil had to be utterly removed from among the children of Israel.</S>
