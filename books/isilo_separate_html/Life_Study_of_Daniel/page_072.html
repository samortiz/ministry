His Armies Profaning the Sanctuary</H2><P>The armies of Antiochus Epiphanes profaned the sanctuary, removed the daily sacrifice, and set up the abomination that desolates (v. 31). Sacrifices, circumcision, and keeping the Sabbath were absolutely forbidden. Antiochus Epiphanes even went so far as to erect an altar to Zeus on the altar of burnt offering in the temple. This was the "abomination that desolates" mentioned in verse 31. Moreover, he set up his own image in the temple, sacrificed a sow on the altar, and sprinkled its blood in the temple. He forced the holy people to worship the idol and eat pork, and he seduced young men to commit fornication in the temple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Persecuting and Slaying the Devoted Jews</H2><P>In verses 33 through 35 we see that Antiochus Epiphanes persecuted and slew the devoted Jews.</P><P>Verse 32b says, "The people who know their God will show strength and take action." This refers to Judas Maccabeus and his people, who were encouraged and strengthened by this word in the book of Daniel to take action against Antiochus Epiphanes and his armies. Verses 33 through 35 go on to speak more concerning the Maccabees. Verses 33 tells us that "those with insight among the people will cause the many to understand," that is, to teach others to understand God's will. According to verse 34, the Maccabees would receive a little help, and many joined themselves to them in word only. Finally, verse 35 says, "Some of those with insight will fall, in order to refine the people and to purify and cleanse them, until the time of the end, for the end is still at the appointed time."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
