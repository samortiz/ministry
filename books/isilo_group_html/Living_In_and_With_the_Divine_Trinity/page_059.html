Everything that is covered in the book of Philippians is under God's operating move. God has a move on this earth, and He moves by His operating.</P><P>In order to see God's operating in us, it would be helpful for us to have a brief review of the book of Philippians. Philippians is a book concerning our experience of Christ. Chapter one shows us that we need to live and magnify Christ for Him to be our living and expression. Chapter two shows that we need to take Christ as our pattern and hold Him forth. In chapter three we see that we need to pursue and gain Christ as our goal. Chapter four shows us that we need to have Christ as our secret of sufficiency. In verse 12 of chapter four, Paul declares that he has learned the secret. He uses a metaphor concerning a person being initiated into a secret society with instruction in its rudimentary principles. Actually, this "secret society" in chapter four is the Body of Christ. In conclusion, we can say that in chapter one of Philippians, Christ is our living and expression; in chapter two He is our pattern; in chapter three He is our goal; and in chapter four He is our secret. All four chapters reveal a certain aspect of Christ for us to experience.</P><P>Chapter two gives us the overall thought, the all-embracing thought, the all-inclusive thought, of the book of Philippians. This thought is that the moving God is operating in us. Whatever Christ is to us is for the operating of God. We should care for God's operating in us. Our God is living, moving, and operating in you and me continuously. God's operating in us can be compared to our blood circulation or to the circulation of electricity. If the flow of blood within us stops, our life will stop. The circulation of blood is life operating in us. The flow of electricity is the operating of the electricity. If the flow of electricity stops in a building, there will be no light there.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Living In and With the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
