   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NATURAL RELIGION VERSUS REVELATIONAL RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are two kinds of religion: religion based on natural concepts and religion based on revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Natural religion starts with man as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is the one that is seeking after God and studying about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What then is revelational religion?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelational religion comes directly from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the One who comes to reveal things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man's thoughts are often useless fancies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's revelation alone is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christianity is different from all other natural religions in that it is a religion that comes from revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christianity begins from God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is God who comes to seek out man, rather than man who seeks after God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I will not try to persuade you to believe in Christianity or to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I will only make a few suppositions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will treat the subject in the same way as if we were solving a problem in geometry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will start from the suppositions and then deduce our arguments step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will examine our reasonings to see if they are sound and if our conclusions are logical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As in mathematics, with some problems we work forwards, while with others we work backwards.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At any rate, in the end we should be able to tell whether or not a supposition is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A FEW SUPPOSITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to make a few suppositions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first one is that God exists.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This in fact has been covered by us already.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have agreed that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is a Being who has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second, we assume that God has a desire to reveal Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God wants to reveal Himself to man and if He wants us to know Him, how does He do it?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In what manner can He be made known to us?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If He speaks to us through thunder or writes to us through lightning, we will not be able to comprehend His message.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How then does God make Himself known to us?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE WAY GOD REVEALS HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If He is to reveal Himself and if He wants us to know Him, He necessarily must do it through human means.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What then are the common ways that men communicate with one another?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, they do it through speaking and second through writing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All means of communication, whether telegraph, telephone, sign, or symbols, are all included in these two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God is to manifest Himself, these are the only two means for Him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the present we set aside the aspect of speaking; we will see how God communicates with us through writing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God reveals Himself through writing, of all the volumes written by different people throughout the centuries, there must be one book which is divinely inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a very crucial test.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If such a book exists, it proves not only the existence of God, but it contains His written revelation to us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is there then such a divinely written book?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the search for such a book, let us first mention a few basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose I want to order a book from a publisher.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If I can tell him the name and author of the book, there will be no trouble getting it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If, however, I forget the name and author of the book, I can describe the characteristics of it to the publisher, such as the contents, size, color, binding, etc. The publisher will then search through all his books and locate the volume I want.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has one book in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How do we find it?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to know its characteristics first.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If there is any book that has been written by God, it must meet certain conditions or have certain qualifications before one can say that it is from God.</S>
