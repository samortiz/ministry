   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The God who was uncreated and eternal, through incarnation, brought God into man, and through death and resurrection brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the Lord s resurrection, the Bible calls Him the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord who became flesh, who died and resurrected, and who was glorified is now the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The definite article the in the Greek text of 2 Corinthians 3:17 indicates that the Spirit is the unique Spirit in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is God Himself, and the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit referred to here, however, is different from the uncreated, eternal Spirit, because in this Spirit referred to here there is both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Andrew Murray once said that there is both divinity and humanity in the glorified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord being the Spirit is one of the accomplishments of the Lord becoming flesh, dying, and resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>SPIRITUAL REALITY DEPENDING ON THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today Jesus is both in the heavens and on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is omnipresent because He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the Spirit, so He is beyond time, space, and all things in the universe from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When as the Spirit He comes into contact with a person s spirit, that person is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything having to do with the spirit and all spiritual reality hinges on the contact and mingling of the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During China s War of Resistance against Japan, there was a man who was known for being ferocious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was so mean that no one dared to approach him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, one day this changed, and he told everyone joyfully, The Lord Jesus has saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Formerly, this person was so evil that he was very cruel even to his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But one day he heard the gospel, and mysteriously, he began to have a lack of peace within him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He began to feel that he was a person who did not honor his mother, and all the scenes in which he had treated his mother cruelly flashed before his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One night he cried without control.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The next day he knelt before his mother, telling her in tears, Mother, I am rebellious and incurable, but today the Lord Jesus has entered me and given me the feeling that I have failed you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>People who saw this man weep were able to see in his tears that he had changed and was not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why did he change?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He changed because he received the Lord s Spirit into his spirit, and when the Lord s Spirit touched his spirit, he received the feeling, the consciousness, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This consciousness of life enabled him to realize his wrongdoings and confess to his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the story of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is also spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord in whom we believe is living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we believe in Him, His Spirit stirs within us and touches our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This brings about a response, an action, which may be to repent or confess.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This response is expressed in a simple way in a person s living and is not something that we can outwardly demand of him or place upon him as a restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The genuine Christian living is something that comes from the living Christ, the living Spirit, who enters into man, touches man s spirit, and lives out from him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This produces an expression, which before man is love and before God is fear and spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>BEING GREATER THAN THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should never say that to be a Christian is a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is true that we have to rid ourselves of drinking, smoking, favoritism, and bribery, and that we must also honor our parents and love our neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To do these things may be truly a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to know, however, that genuine Christians do all these things not by outward regulation or teaching but by the inner power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>History tells us that in the two thousand years of church history, because of this living Spirit, the more that Christians have suffered persecution, the stronger they have been inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is because even if the whole universe were to rise up to oppose the Spirit, it would not be able to overcome Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Over these two thousand years there have been many kings who have persecuted Christians and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, today all these kings have passed away, and the church is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The God of creation becomes a living power in those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He will never be defeated, and whoever opposes Him will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is the living God, the One who is without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today this God is the Spirit who is living in us and is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since we have such a Spirit in us, there is no difficulty that we are unable to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since we have such a Spirit in us, there are no situations that we are unable to pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, we have to say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The God who is the Spirit is in us, and He is greater than the world 1 John 4:4 .</S>
