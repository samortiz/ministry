<h1 class="title">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT IN OUR LIVING<br />
AND IN THE MEETINGS</h1>
<p>The Lord wants to lead us out of rituals, ordinances, doctrines, and methods. Therefore, we should follow the spirit and not methods. At present we still depend on methods. We have dropped an old method and turned to a new method. Thus, the nature of our meetings has not changed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEETINGS BEING THE EXPRESSION OF OUR LIVING</h2>
<p>A change in nature makes a change in concept, not a change from one method to another method but rather a change from methods to the Spirit. Whether we use an old method, a new method, a wrong method, or a right method, we are still using and depending on methods, not on the Spirit. We know that we are not depending on the Spirit, because in the meetings our spirit is not living; the condition of our meetings is not ideal. Some meetings may seem like a performance. Calling on the Lord and praising Him in order to have a released and uplifted spirit should be our living, not a performance. We should have a released and uplifted spirit not only when we are in the meetings. Hence, calling on the Lord and praising Him should be our daily practice.</p>
<p>It is easier to pray and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name in a meeting than to pray and call on His name in other places, such as on the street or in a bus. Our spiritual condition should match our living; they should be the same. Although it may not be suitable to call loudly upon the Lord&rsquo;s name when we are in a bus, we can still exercise our spirit. We can call softly, not loudly. If we spend our time looking around instead of fellowshipping with the Lord when we are in the meeting, our calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name will be a performance. This situation indicates that our meeting life is separate from our daily living. This is wrong. We truly need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to save us.</p>
<p>Since our meetings are the expression of our daily living, there is no need to consider which method we should use. Breathing is not a matter of method. We do not need to stand in a particular way in order to breathe, nor do we need to make a conscious effort to breathe. We breathe spontaneously in every place. However, in some places we can practice deep breathing, but in other places this is not suitable. Our meetings should be an expression of our daily living. Some Christians argue and fight in their daily life but are well behaved when they gather to worship. This is a performance. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we have a change in our concept. We are not changing methods; we are changing our concept.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In the meetings we should not rely on any method but should follow the Spirit. It is not wrong to call loudly on the name of the Lord, but this kind of calling has become a new method. It seems as if we do not know how to pray anymore, because calling has replaced praying. Surely, this kind of calling is not exercising the spirit or following the Spirit. Does the Spirit lead us only to call in a loud way? Good music has a beautiful melody with high and low notes; it should not have only one note. We may be used to this kind of calling, but the new believers are not accustomed to the noise, and it is unpleasant. We need a change in concept.</p>
<p>Formerly, in our meetings we followed a routine and ordinances. Every week our meetings followed the same routine. We have condemned that way of meeting and put it to death. Now we are learning to follow the Spirit. However, while following the Spirit, we picked up the method of calling loudly. This is another method. Some saints said that without a method, they do not know what to do. To follow a method is to not follow the Spirit. The Spirit does not move like a train that follows tracks. The Spirit is like wind that blows where it wills (John 3:8). The wind may blow from the east in the morning, blow from the south in the afternoon, and be a whirlwind in the evening. The Spirit is like wind that has no set direction and no set method.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, in the New Testament age Christian meetings should not have any rules. The Bible does not say how Christians should meet, nor does it give rules for Christian meetings. We need to be led by the Spirit. When we do not know how to follow the Spirit, we pick up methods. The Baptist denomination has the Baptist method, the Presbyterian denomination has the Presbyterian method, the Methodist denomination has the Methodist method, and the Lutheran denomination has the Lutheran method. Every denomination has its method. We also have found a method. However, instead of following a method, we should live by the Spirit. Our meetings are not a performance; they are the expression of our daily living. We walk according to the Spirit in our daily life so that when we come to the meetings, we will continue to walk according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>If we live by the Spirit in our daily life by fellowshipping with Him, praising Him, and looking to Him, we will have inspiration in the meetings. The Spirit may lead a brother to say, &ldquo;Lord, we worship You!&rdquo; There is no need to wait for someone to call a hymn. When the brother says, &ldquo;Lord, we worship You!&rdquo; the meeting begins. Immediately another brother may say, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, You are truly worthy of our worship.&rdquo; Then spontaneously a sister may begin singing a hymn of worship, and everyone joins her. In this way, no specific person is designated to call a hymn or to open the meeting. After the singing, a brother might give a testimony, and another brother might read a few verses. Although our activities are different, we are following the Spirit.</p>
<p>This is the flow of the Spirit, and every saint should follow this flow. This can be compared to a team playing basketball. When one member begins playing, the rest of the team should be ready. When one person receives the ball, he should pass it to another person. There is no rule concerning who should pass and who should receive the ball.</p>
<p>In the meetings we tend to be strict when we pray the hymns; there is no flow, and the prayers are not connected. We do not listen to the prayers of the other saints. As a result, we do not water each other&rsquo;s spirit, and we cannot touch the supply of the Spirit by following the sense in our spirit.</p>
<p>In order to be saved from these shortcomings, we need to live in our spirit daily. Otherwise, instead of being able to participate in the meetings, we will be spectators. We will be like spectators in a basketball game who, because they do not practice with the team, cannot dribble, pass, or catch the ball. Some saints do not exercise their spirit regularly. They have proper conduct, love the Lord, and are concerned for the church, but they lack the exercise of their spirit. Such ones are like members in the denominations. Thus, they do not participate in our meetings, because in our meetings everyone must exercise their spirit to carry out their priestly ministry.</p>
<p>Some may say, &ldquo;I cannot play ball. If you force me to play, you will cause me to suffer. I can watch you and cheer you on, but do not force me to play.&rdquo; In the church life there are no spectators or observers; everyone must be a participant. Those who want to be spectators and not participate are bringing in the clergy-laity system because the saints who participate will become the clergy, and those who are spectators will become the laity. There should be no such distinction in the churches. We are all priests, and we all must participate in the meetings.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament a priest could not say, &ldquo;I will offer sacrifices, but please do not ask me to burn incense. I can bring the sacrifices for you to kill and skin, and I can carry them to the burnt-offering altar, but I cannot enter the tabernacle to burn incense. We each have our own function. Do not force me to do that service.&rdquo; It is true that we each have our own function, but there are some things that we cannot do for another person. For example, we cannot ask someone to drink water or to eat for us. Everyone has a service, such as sweeping the floor or dusting the window. However, we all need to breathe, drink, and eat for ourselves. When we meet, we come to eat and drink spiritually; hence, no one can participate on our behalf.</p>
<p>In the denominations it is not possible for everyone to participate in the preaching, praying, and singing, so there is the need for some to study in the seminaries in order to carry out these functions. Some study how to give sermons or how to preach the gospel, and some study music. A person who studies music will lead the singing in a denomination when he graduates. He cannot speak or visit the saints. This is not our way. The divine life within us is a priestly life, so we cannot say that we do not know how to serve. Any person who is saved has the capacity to serve, but his actual service depends on the daily exercise of his spirit. Therefore, we all need to diligently practice exercising our spirit.</p>
<p>We must not be idle in the meetings. Since we come to a meeting to function, when the meeting begins, we should be ready to function. Hence, we must be alert. If we are idle, it will be difficult to have a meeting.</p>
<p>Since the Lord does not lead us according to set rules or methods, we need to exercise our spirit daily in order to be living, and we need to live before the Lord. Furthermore, when we come to a meeting, we must be alert and ready to minister as priests by offering our portion of Christ at the opportune moment.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
