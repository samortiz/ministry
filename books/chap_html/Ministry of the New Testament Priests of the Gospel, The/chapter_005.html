These matters, especially the last two, are very much involved with the aspect of practice. How should we ask and answer questions in the group meetings? How should we learn? How should we teach? Furthermore, prophesying in the meetings is a particularly new matter. How can we change our meetings from one person speaking and everyone else listening to all speaking and listening mutually? We all want to learn these matters.
