   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT FOLLOWING THE WORD,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE WORD FOLLOWING THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two ways to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first way is to put the spirit into the word and then to push out the word with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second way to speak is to follow the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spirit takes the lead, and the word follows the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the spirit and the word are joined together, there are these two different ways to release them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we are speaking, God may want to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He puts this something in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we release this word in our spirit, we release our own spirit at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We pack the spirit into the word, sentence by sentence, and then send this word out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is one way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, we are the servants.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As ministers of the word, we exercise our will to pack the spirit into the word and then release and push out this word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the word is released, the spirit is released with it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As one speaks with his mouth, he inwardly pushes with his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As he speaks, he pushes out the word with his spirit, and the spirit goes with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While the word is going out, he packs his spirit into the word and delivers them together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When such a word reaches man, the spirit also reaches man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By God s mercy, this kind of speaking can be very strong; the spirit can be very strong as well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While the mouth speaks, the heart pushes the spirit on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is one kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Another way of speaking is to find the power and anointing coming upon us as we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before we speak, the anointing goes before us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Under the brooding and sway of this power, we speak according to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The anointing flows out, and our words follow the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we have to learn to follow the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As our spirit senses something, we should follow this sense with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As more senses come, we should follow with more words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of speaking enables the spirit to flow out in a continuous way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The advantage of this kind of speaking is that we cannot go wrong easily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The anointing is always before us, and the word always follows.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we speak under the influence of the power of the anointing, the word follows the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It may be less spectacular, but it does not easily err.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These two ways of speaking are different.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ways in which the speaker addresses the audience, according to these two ways, are also different.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the first way, the speaker can set his eyes on the audience and look at them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He can study their faces and conditions while he is pushing out his word with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the second way, the speaker cannot look at the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His entire focus should be on his spirit, his very own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He should detect where the anointing is flowing and turn his words in that direction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He should stand at the door like a watchman.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As soon as the anointing comes, he should follow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He should follow the anointing and not be concerned with others expressions, attitudes, and reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He should follow the anointing sentence by sentence under the influence of the power of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This way of speaking pays no attention to the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As soon as the speaker turns his attention to the audience, he is frustrated from following the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who are learning to speak by the spirit have to learn to speak according to these two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes when the Lord wants us to speak, He first activates our mind by His mercy to utter some outer words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the same time, our spirit bursts forth through these same words; we pack our spirit into these words and shoot them out in a burst or an explosion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At other times the Lord wants us to focus all our energy on waiting inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our entire being, including our thoughts, should be focused on our spirit and in a state of waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the Lord gives us the anointing, we are led along the way step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The anointing is before us, and by God s mercy, our mind produces a word that matches the sense of the anointing within.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we can release this word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The anointing is always before us, and our words follow behind it sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are not concerned at all about our audience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our eyes are set on no one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although we see faces, we have no feeling toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All of our feelings are focused on the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All of our thoughts and attention are focused on the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The anointing takes the lead, and our words follow it sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Such a release of the spirit also brings God s children to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In their ministry, the ministers of the word should experience both conditions; they should bring God s children to the Spirit through both of these ways.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A message should be delivered under the leading and guidance of the anointing from beginning to end. However, at critical times, the speaker has to give an extra push to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the best kind of ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The speaking by the anointing occupies the bulk of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The speaker follows the anointing and delivers his message sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is not concerned about the reaction of his audience, and he does not care who is sitting in front of him; he is faithful only to follow the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When he finds where the anointing is, he finds the seam through which he can squeeze out his word sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He knows within himself that his words are following the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As he is releasing his word this way, he may want to bless his audience; he may want to discharge the blessing with a strong impact.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this case he may want to change his way of speaking and speak in a way that discharges his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On the one hand, he needs the power of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On the other hand, he has to pack his word with the spirit and discharge his spirit this way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When this happens, he will witness the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Others will receive revelation when he wants them to receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Others will fall on their face when he wants them to fall on their face.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Others will see when he wants them to see.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The lowest kind of ministry of the word is the kind which merely helps others to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The highest kind of ministry of the word is one which opens men s eyes and causes them to fall on their face.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In order for others to advance from merely understanding with the mind to an opening of the eyes and then to a falling on their face, the speaker has to be willing to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Everything depends on how much he is willing to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If he is willing to pay the price, others will receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When there is the anointing of the Spirit as well as the pushing of his own spirit, others will see something through his speaking, and they will fall down on their face.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The crucial factor is the kind of price the speaker is willing to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For a minister of the word, the basic issue is the matter of the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must pay full attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The outer man must be broken because the spirit can realize its function only to the extent that the outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Holy Spirit pays constant attention to the breaking of the outer man in His disciplining work.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have to allow the Holy Spirit to work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we do not rebel against the discipline of the Holy Spirit and if we do not fight against it according to our own will, the Spirit will subdue our outer man, and our inner man will become useful to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the reason the breaking of the outer man is so crucial.</S>
