   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW WAY SOME INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING THE FURTHERANCE OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are a few matters which we must be clear about in the practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, the church in Taipei is taking the lead in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although at present it has not fully entered in, at least it has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, the results from this term of the training have been very rich: six thousand were baptized through door-knocking and two thousand home meetings have been established.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At present there are seven hundred trainees who are still bearing this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, we have a long-range view before us, which is the evangelization of Taiwan and then of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We pointed out previously that we will need five years to complete the evangelization of Taiwan and that the ideal situation would be to produce one thousand full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now there are about five hundred qualified full-time trainees; if in the next year and the following year we are able to produce another two hundred fifty trainees per year, we will have a total of one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If this happens, the goal of evangelizing Taiwan in five years will be assured.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This future, this long-range view, is set before us, so we must not slow down or stop; instead, we must continue pressing on.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since 1974 we have had the summer and winter trainings for the life-study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On average, more than eighteen hundred people attend the live training, and together with the video trainings there are a total of at least five thousand people attending every training.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This burden is necessary and very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now the full-time training here in Taipei is burning like wildfire, but I must return to America to prepare for the life-study training.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, I hope that the trainers will be able to continue bearing this heavy burden to keep the training moving forward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apart from the trainers, I hope that three other groups in the churches would be able to offer their shoulders to help bear the burden of the practice of the Lord's new way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first group is the elders in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 5:14 says, "Awake, sleeper."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot continue sleeping; we must awake and arise.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ninety elders take the lead in twenty-three meeting halls to promote the new way for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This burden is very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the changing of the system is delayed due to the elders' unwillingness to rise up, we may not know its effect until eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The new way must get through first in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the elders in Taipei do not wake up, then the church in Taipei will be like a "dead end," and it will drain the morale out of the training.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope the elders in the church in Taipei will all see this crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second group is the ones who have the heart to remain in the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are a total of about five hundred from abroad, from other places in this province, and from the city of Taipei itself who are willing to stay and help care for the two thousand home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Among these are about one hundred saints from abroad, many of whom want to bring their families over to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are also many from overseas who want to attend the next term of the training.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church in Taipei must prepare places for them to live; this burden is also very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third group is all the saints from the church in Taipei who, two weeks ago, signed their names to consecrate themselves and express their willingness to go out door-knocking for two hours every week for the Lord or to lead a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to have some fellowship with these three groups of people to instruct them and give them some explanation so that they will understand what they should do in the present situation.</S>
