<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. On the Positive Side</H2><P>Now we come to the positive side of the contents of the seven trumpets, of the seventh seal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Kingdom of the World Becoming the Kingdom<br>of Our Lord and of His Christ,<br>and Christ Reigning Forever and Ever</H2><P>The kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever (Rev. 11:15, 17b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Rewarding<br>of the Lord's Slaves the Prophets,<br>and the Saints and Those Who Fear<br>the Lord's Name, the Small and the Great,<br>at the Judgment Seat of Christ</H2><P>There will also be the rewarding of the Lord's slaves the prophets, and the saints and those who fear the Lord's name, the small and the great, at the judgment seat of Christ (Rev. 11:18b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Marriage of the Lamb</H2><P>There will be the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9). This will be the marriage of Christ and His overcomers. The processed Triune God as the Lamb will marry the regenerated and transformed tripartite man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Kingdom of a Thousand Years</H2><P>There will also be the kingdom of a thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The New Heaven and the New Earth<br>with the New Jerusalem</H2><P>At the end of the seventh seal, there will be the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Finishing of the Mystery of God<br>as the Good News Announced to<br>God's Own Slaves the Prophets</H2><P>The completion of the events is the seventh seal will be the finishing of the mystery of God as the good news announced to God's own slaves the prophets (Rev. 10:7). The seven seals and the seven trumpets end with the New Jerusalem.</P><P>The book of Revelation can be considered as a scroll. Before the ascension of Christ, there was such a scroll, but it was not opened. After His ascension, Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, and the Lamb opened this scroll. The seven seals with which the scroll is sealed are actually the contents of the scroll and the contents of the book of Revelation. This book is just the opening, the unveiling, of the seven seals. Today by the Lord's mercy we have an open scroll before us.</P>
