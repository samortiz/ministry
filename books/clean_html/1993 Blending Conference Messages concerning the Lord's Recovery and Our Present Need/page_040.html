<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING BY VARIOUS BROTHERS<br>CONCERNING ONENESS VERSUS DIVISION<br>ONENESS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Genuine Oneness among the Believers<br>of Christ Being of the Triune God</H2><P>John 17:22-23 says, "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one." These verses show that the genuine oneness among the believers of Christ is of the Triune God. The Triune God is one. In John 14:8 Philip asked the Lord Jesus, "Show us the Father and it is sufficient for us." The Lord responded, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?" (vv. 9-10a). In these verses the Lord Jesus indicated that the Father and the Son are one (10:30). Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "And the Lord is the Spirit." According to this verse, the Lord, that is, Christ, is the Spirit. This is confirmed by 1 Corinthians 15:45b: "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." The last Adam, of course, is the Lord Jesus in the flesh, and the life-giving Spirit is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who gives life (John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6). This indicates that the Son and the Spirit also are one. Thus, according to the clear revelation of the Scriptures, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;the three of the Divine Trinity&#151;are one.</P><P>In ourselves we do not have the genuine oneness. The genuine oneness is of the Triune God. How, then, can we enter into this oneness? In John 14:20 the Lord Jesus said, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you," and in John 14:23 He said, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him." In Galatians 3:27-28 the apostle Paul said that we were all baptized into Christ and we are all one in Christ Jesus. Therefore, in order to enter into the genuine oneness, we must open ourselves and receive Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, into us and also be baptized into Christ to enter into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19).</P><P>Not only so, the real oneness originates from the Triune God. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed three times that the believers of Christ would be one even as the Triune God is one (vv. 11, 21, 22). The phrase "even as We are one" in verse 22 indicates that the real oneness originates from the Triune God. So, in order for us, the believers of Christ, to have the real oneness, we need to enter into the Triune God, who is the origin of the genuine oneness. This is indicated by the Lord's word "that they also may be in Us" in verse 21.</P><P>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ created the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man, making peace. The Lord Jesus went to the cross to break down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, and create the two in Himself into one new man. It is in Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, that the Jews and the Gentiles can be one new man. This too shows that the real oneness originates from the Triune God.</P><P>The three of the Divine Trinity are really one among Themselves. In addition to the verses cited above, which show that the three of the Divine Trinity are one among Themselves essentially, there are many portions in the New Testament that reveal that the three of the Divine Trinity are one among Themselves economically in their coordination for the divine move and in our experience. For example, in John 14:10 the Lord Jesus said, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works." According to this verse, the Son speaks the words, but the Father, who abides in the Son, does His works. Thus, whenever the Lord Jesus speaks, the Father works. Ephesians 1:3 tells us that the Father has blessed us with every spiritual blessing [blessing of the Spirit] in Christ [the Son], and verses 4-14 of the same chapter show us the Father's selection and predestination, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging for the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into the believers to produce the church, the Body of Christ. Then, in 3:14-19 the Father strengthens the believers through the Spirit into their inner man that Christ, the Son, may make His home in their hearts, that the believers may be filled unto all the fullness of the Divine Trinity. In 4:4-6 we see the one Spirit as the essence, the one Lord [the Son] as the element, and the one Father as the source of the one Body of Christ. Many other verses can be cited to show that the three of the Divine Trinity are really one among Themselves.</P><P>We need to pray that we may have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see that the genuine oneness among the believers is not of the believers themselves, but is of the Triune God and originates from the Triune God. We also need to see the oneness among the three of the Divine Trinity. If we see this vision, it will control our Christian life. This vision of the genuine oneness will bring us into the reality of the Body of Christ, and there will be no divisions among us.</P>
