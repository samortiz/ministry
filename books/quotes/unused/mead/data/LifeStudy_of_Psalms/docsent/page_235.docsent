   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE VICTORY OF GOD IN HIS DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 76 is on the victory of God in His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A. The Victory of God,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>as the Glorious and Excellent One,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>in His Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 1 through 5 are a declaration concerning the victory of God, as the glorious and excellent One, in His tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 2 says, "In Salem is His tabernacle,/And His dwelling place, in Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 4 speaks of God's excellence and glory: "More glorious are You,/More excellent than the mountains of prey."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. The Praise of the Psalmist</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>concerning the Wrath and Fearfulness of God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verses 6 through 12 are the praise of the psalmist concerning the wrath and fearfulness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning God's wrath, verse 10 says that He will gird Himself "with the remainder of wrath."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning God's fearfulness, verse 7 declares, "You, indeed You, are to be feared," and verse 11 says, "Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psalms 73 through 76 cover four matters: the sufferings of the saints, the desolation of God's house, the judgment of Christ, and the victory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since these four psalms are the expressions of the psalmists' complex sentiments, we need to discern those sentiments that are divine from those that are merely human.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that we need to discern the Holy Word according to the proper principles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To understand the Old Testament, we need the writings of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If as we study the Psalms we stand on the shoulders of Paul, we will have a clear view of all one hundred and fifty psalms.</S>
