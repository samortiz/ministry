<h1 class="title">THE HEADING UP OF ALL THINGS</h1>
<h2 class="head2">Heading Up All Things</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan for the church is not only to mingle Himself with man and to make known to Satan and his angels the multifarious wisdom of God but also to head up all things in the heavens and on the earth in Christ His Son. Ephesians 1 has two wonderful statements. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;To head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; Then verse 22 says, &ldquo;He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo; Christ is the Head of the church, and He is the Head over all things to the church.</p>
<p>Christ is the Head, the preeminent One, not only over the church but also over all things. He is the Head over all things to the church. Christ being the Head over all things is absolutely related to the church. Whether Christ can be the Head over all things, whether all things can be subjected to the authority of Christ, and whether all things can be headed up in Christ completely depend upon whether or not the church exists, has been produced, and has grown up. When the church exists, God is able to subject all things to the authority of Christ. By means of the church, Christ is able to be the Head over all things.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Three Purposes in God&rsquo;s Plan for the Church</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s plan for the church, He has three main purposes: first, for the church to obtain the sonship, to be holy, and to be to Himself; second, that the church would make known the multifarious wisdom of God to Satan and his angels; and third, that through the church He would head up all things. In order for us to obtain the sonship, He first causes us to receive His life, and then He works Himself into us. Eventually, He causes us to inherit all that He is so that we might fully enter into Him. To be holy is to be first separated and sanctified unto Him and then changed in nature inwardly to become the same as God. In other words, we who are made of clay become men of gold through sanctification and a change in nature.</p>
<p>Sanctification in the Bible begins with separation and ends with a change in nature. When we were saved, God separated us from the descendants of Adam, but this separation was only the beginning. From that time, God&rsquo;s life in us began to transform us. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the image of the Lord. Our being transformed is carried out by the Lord&rsquo;s life, which is inwardly transforming us every day. This is the meaning of being changed in nature. At the beginning of Genesis 2, the one who stood before God was a man of clay. At that time God was God, and man was man. Even though man was standing before God, God had not yet entered into man. Since God is continuously changing the nature of man inwardly, by the end of the book of Revelation God will be mingled with man and man will become &ldquo;gold.&rdquo; At that time, there will no longer be the nature of clay in man; rather, in nature he will be &ldquo;gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The process that takes place from Genesis to Revelation can be described as the stage of the &ldquo;treasure in earthen vessels,&rdquo; as spoken of in 2 Corinthians 4:7. In this stage there is both the treasure and the vessel. When man has Christ as the treasure in him, even though outwardly he is a vessel of clay, inwardly he possesses a &ldquo;golden&rdquo; life. Thus, upon receiving the Lord, man begins to be transformed inwardly until he is raptured. At that time the Lord will have completely transformed the visible body of clay into His glorious image. At that time man will be fully sanctified, and the city that will be manifested will be called the holy city. Sanctification begins with separation and ends with a change in nature.</p>
<p>What we speak of here is not based merely upon doctrines but also upon our spiritual experience. After we were saved, we were different from our colleagues, classmates, and neighbors; however, this was only the beginning. From this point onward, we must pay attention to our walk and behavior. Is there a change in our living and our inner nature? Are we living on our own, or are we living in the mingling with God? Our colleagues go to the movies, and we come to the meetings, but is our going to the meetings sanctification? We serve in the church, but who is serving, and does our service issue from God&rsquo;s transformation of us? We need to consider these matters. If there is no inward transformation, even our preaching will be at most an outward sanctification. We should ask, &ldquo;Is my preaching only from myself, or is it from the Spirit of God through His transforming work in me?&rdquo; Being completely sanctified is not a matter of avoiding worldly things but rather a matter of whether we are doing something related to God by ourselves or by God&rsquo;s transforming work within us.</p>
<p>It is the same with our reading of the Bible. When we read the Bible, we need to ask ourselves whether we are reading with only our mind or whether we are reading by the transformation of the Spirit of God within us. If we are reading only with our mind, our reading is merely an outward sanctification without an inward change in nature. Hence, after we are saved, we should not be a &ldquo;single&rdquo; person, but a &ldquo;dual&rdquo; person; that is, we must be ones who live by two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity. This means that when we speak, it should not be us alone who are speaking but the Lord who is speaking in us through His mingling with us. When we read the Bible, we should not be reading it by ourselves but by the Lord who is reading in us through His mingling with us. When we visit the brothers and sisters, it should not be us alone who are speaking but the Lord who is speaking through us to the brothers and sisters by clothing us with Himself outwardly and transforming us inwardly. After the conversation, we should be able to sense that the Lord has transformed us a little more. This is practical sanctification, a sanctification in living, an inward sanctification, and a complete sanctification. Eventually, in the New Jerusalem our nature will be completely changed. We will not only be separated from all things, but we will also no longer have any of our nature of clay. In contrast, we will be full of the nature of gold and completely changed in nature.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s first purpose in His plan for the church is to work Himself into man and to work man into Himself so that God and man can be completely mingled together. This not only solves God&rsquo;s problem, but it also solves the church&rsquo;s problem. When a couple gets married, for example, both of their problems are solved. As long as a single man does not have a woman to match him, he feels restless. Similarly, as long as a single woman does not have a man to match her, she feels restless. When a single man marries a single woman, a wonderful marriage is accomplished. The man gives himself to the woman, and the woman gives herself to the man. In this way both their problems are solved. Marriage is a type of God entering into man and of man entering into God; the two become joined as one.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 God spoke on behalf of Adam, saying, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone&rdquo; (v. 18). God also spoke this word on behalf of Himself. In the universe it is not good for God to be alone. God needs a counterpart, and this counterpart is the church chosen and created in Him. The church is God&rsquo;s counterpart. If God were not joined to the church, God would be alone, and this would not be good. Only when God is joined to the church will He have rest. In the same way, as far as the church is concerned, her problem will not be solved if she is not joined to God. Hence, God&rsquo;s first purpose for the church is to solve His problem and the problem of the church. Revelation 21:3 says, &ldquo;The tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them.&rdquo; On that day God will be satisfied, and man will be satisfied; God&rsquo;s problem will be solved, and man&rsquo;s problem will be solved.</p>
<p>Second, God&rsquo;s purpose for the church is to deal with Satan, who is the rebellious force in the universe. God must shame Satan through the church so that Satan&rsquo;s mouth will be shut and so that he will see the multifarious wisdom of God. Third, the purpose of God for the church is to solve the problems of the universe and to head up all things. The solution to all problems&mdash;the problem of God, the problem of man, the problem of Satan, and the problem of the universe&mdash;depends upon the church. Hence, the church is the unique means for God to deal with these problems. Without the church, God&rsquo;s problem, man&rsquo;s problem, Satan&rsquo;s problem, and the problem of the universe will not be solved. The solution to all these problems depends upon the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 1, The Meaning of the Church &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
