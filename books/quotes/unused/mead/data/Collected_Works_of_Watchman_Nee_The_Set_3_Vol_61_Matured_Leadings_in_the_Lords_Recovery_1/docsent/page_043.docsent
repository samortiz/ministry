   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT CHANGING GOD'S WILL,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT LOWERING HIS STANDARD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to be a servant of God and in order to serve Him, we have to uphold His will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot change God's will, and we cannot lower His standard for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A person from a denomination once said, "The Bible does not say explicitly that we should not smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, believers can smoke, and even pastors can smoke."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if Gentiles consider smoking bad for them, how will they feel when they see Christians smoke?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No matter how we view the matter, when a Christian smokes, it places him in a lower position than the Gentiles; it is a step backward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose Brother Chan and Brother Chow are both smoking in the meeting today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It will be hard for some brothers and sisters to fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The smokers may feel that they are actually better than others in many areas, but as long as some brothers and sisters think that it is wrong to smoke, the smokers will have to stop if they want to keep their fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everyone wants to take the easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the reason some people opt for sprinkling instead of immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sprinkled ones should realize that there are those who consider sprinkling to be contrary to the Lord's commandment and that continuing in their way stops everyone from being perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Smoking and baptism are examples only.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we tolerate many sins or teachings, we will open a back door for sinful and fleshly ones to come in, while placing a stumbling block before seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people do not believe in miracles and are even afraid of them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many other people, however, have experienced God's answer to their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we say that miracles ceased with the apostles, we can satisfy some who are weak in faith, but there are still many in the world who have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our word will become a stumbling block to their perfection in God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, we cannot change any commandment that God has ordained in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Selling one's all to follow the Lord is an ordained way that God has revealed in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in China during the past one hundred years, no one dared to say such a thing except for the "Jesus Family" Je-Su-Chia-Ting .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one dared to talk about forsaking all to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we preach the gospel to others today, do we tell them that they can be rich and at the same time live a Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have pursued perfection in the past, and we have obeyed the Lord in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why should we come short in this one thing?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Can we be victorious in many things yet fail in this one thing?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A few years ago when I was in Shanghai, a member of a denominational church came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wanted to argue about baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He gave me many reasons for not practicing immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the end the only reason he gave was that it was inconvenient to immerse people and that there was no need to insist on it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I said, "This is the Lord's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot respond to Him by saying that it is optional."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later we changed the subject to foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He asked me, "Do you practice foot-washing?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you break bread to remember the Lord every Lord's Day?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I said that we practice foot-washing and break bread every Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the end he asked, "Do you sell all to follow the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I said reluctantly, "We do."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot leave one thing undone; we cannot say that there is one thing that we do not have to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there is one thing not done, we cannot be a proper testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today God is taking the way of recovery in China.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His eyes are on Ephesians 4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul did not shrink back from speaking all the counsels of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not shrink back from doing all of God's will, He will have a way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I will repeat Brother Witness's word: The deeper the channel is, the more the water flows.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Wherever the channel runs deepest, there the water gathers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Water never flows to the shallow places.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today we can only speak for those who are most desirous of obeying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot speak for those who do not want to obey or who are thinking of taking the easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to speak for those who want to pay the price, who want to take God's way today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we make allowance for those who do not have a heart for the Lord in everything, we might as well be the YMCA.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why call ourselves the church?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we want to call ourselves the church, we cannot skip any commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God finds another church that is absolute for His will, He can easily set us aside.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our failure is a small thing, but our failure can delay God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is easy for God to raise up other people, but that would take a dozen or so years or even a few decades.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to give God a way to accomplish His will, we have no alternative but to give our all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not have the right to change His commands.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Among all the commandments of God, one commandment says that we should be delivered from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not be bound by mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If God says that we should forsake everything, we have to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are His slaves; we dare not change His will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are not qualified to change His will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As slaves we have to carry out whatever God says.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Where our treasure is, there our heart is also.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We cannot serve Him and mammon at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore we have to send our money to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is impossible for our treasure to be in heaven and for our heart to remain on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God's will is the most crucial thing to us who are His slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have to try to understand His will fully, and we have to strive to meet His demand with no reservation.</S>
