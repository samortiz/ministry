NOT FOR SUFFERING</h2>
<p><em>Question: Does the cross become heavier or deeper?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is a hymn that says, &ldquo;The cross that He gave may be heavy, / But it ne&rsquo;er outweighs His grace&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #722). This kind of utterance is not scriptural; we cannot find it in the Bible. In experience, however, this utterance is correct. This is like the experience Madame Guyon describes in her book <em>Fragrance of Myrrh.</em> However, we must carefully study this saying, because it has too much of the Catholic background. Catholicism understands the cross as a suffering, and this concept has spread to Christianity in China; thus, many Christians also regard the cross as a suffering.</p>
<p>Thomas &#225; Kempis once said that if we remove one cross, we will receive a heavier one. How many crosses are there? There is only one cross; there are not many crosses. From the experience of the Mystics, the expression that &#225; Kempis used is correct but not scriptural. From the perspective of the truth, there is only one cross. The Mystics had such an experience because they loved the Lord, earnestly desired the Lord, absolutely put themselves aside, and let the Lord reign in them. However, they did not receive the light that we see. They considered their wives, their superiors, and the leading ones in the church as crosses. How this differs from the light the Lord has given us! The thought that the cross becomes heavier is the result of insufficient light concerning the cross. The work of the cross can be deeper but not heavier; only suffering is heavier.</p>
<p>We need to be clear that suffering is not the cross. Both the Catholic Church and Christianity think that the cross is a suffering. However, even though suffering and the cross are somewhat related, suffering is not the cross. The cross is for our termination. When Christ puts the demand of the cross in us, His intention is to terminate us; He requires us to surrender to Him. When He shows us that certain aspects of our personality are too strong, the cross requires us to be broken; however, we may be unwilling to submit. Then He must use an outward environment of suffering to intensify the light of the cross in us, to the extent that we will surrender and completely yield to Him. Even though we should surrender and be broken, we may be unwilling; even though we know that the Lord has an inward demand, we may be unwilling to obey. At such times the Lord will raise up the environment to deal with us, to compel us, and to defeat us. This is the reason Catholics say that the cross is a suffering. However, the cross itself is not a suffering. When we are unwilling to submit to the demand of the cross, God uses the outward environment as a means to help us. God uses the light of the cross inwardly and the dealing of the environment outwardly to subdue us. In brief, the cross is the inward light; the suffering is the outward environment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEATH OF THE CROSS BEING PAINFUL YET SWEET</h2>
<p><em>Question: It seems that those who experience the cross suffer a great deal. Does the Lord&rsquo;s cup of suffering refer to the suffering of the cross?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Those who are unwilling to be subdued in their experience of the cross will feel pain. We may see the light, love the Lord, and know that we need to cooperate with the Lord, and still be unwilling to immediately submit and be subdued, because of our opinion. If this is our situation, the environment gradually grinds away this particular resistance in our being so that we will be subdued, regardless of our preference. The breaking work of the cross in us is in coordination with the outward environment. However, if we are willing to submit to the cross, we will not need the many outward circumstances and difficulties. The principle is that outward circumstances and sufferings cooperate with the light of the cross within us in order to subdue, break, and defeat us.</p>
<p>Although the cross is for termination, no one should say that there is no pain in relation to the cross. It is true that suffering is involved with the cross, but the focus is not on suffering but on death and termination. The Lord Jesus was willing to take the cup of suffering. But His focus was not on suffering but on the cup. As far as the cup is concerned, it is sweet. Experience tells us that when we receive the death of the cross, it is painful yet exceedingly sweet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING<br />
UPON THE DISCIPLES OUTWARDLY<br />
BEFORE THE RESURRECTION OF THE LORD</h2>
<p><em>Question: The Lord Jesus was with His disciples before His crucifixion. At that time, did the disciples have the Spirit of the Lord in them?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Before the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, based on the fact that He had not yet resurrected and ascended to heaven, the disciples did not yet have the Spirit of the Lord. However, the disciples, like the Old Testament saints, had the work of the Holy Spirit upon them; they did not have the Holy Spirit entering and indwelling them. It was only after the Lord&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension that He breathed Himself into the disciples in resurrection, and the Holy Spirit began to indwell them (John 20:22). Although they did not have the Holy Spirit indwelling them prior to this, they had the Holy Spirit upon them as in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PUTTING TO DEATH OF THE CROSS<br />
BEING THE SAME AS THE KILLING OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p><em>Question: After seeing the great light of the cross and the putting to death of our flesh, if we sense that our death is a suffering, have we truly died? If we are dead, will we be like Paul and never sense that it is a suffering?</em></p>
<p>Answer: If we have truly seen the great light of the cross, the cross will not merely be a suffering to us, even though from the human perspective, it is still a suffering. Sister M. E. Barber wrote a hymn that says, &ldquo;Let the spirit praise Thee, / Though the heart be riven&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #377). We often reverse the emphasis and say, &ldquo;The heart is riven, though the spirit praises Thee.&rdquo; We should realize that the purpose of the experience of the cross is death and termination, not suffering, even though some suffering is involved in the process. Our experience confirms this.</p>
<p>Some people think that there is a contradiction in the Bible because it speaks, on the one hand, of our crucifixion through the cross of Christ and, on the other hand, of the putting to death by the Holy Spirit. In our experience the putting to death of the self is based on seeing our &ldquo;co-crucifixion&rdquo; with Christ. Only those who have seen their co-crucifixion with Christ can experience the killing of the cross. In 2 Corinthians 4:10, the &ldquo;putting to death,&rdquo; the killing, the deadening, is the operation of the death of the cross which kills us daily. This daily killing is the putting to death in Romans 8:13 and Colossians 3:5. Putting to death is based upon the effect of the killing of the cross. Hence, the putting to death, the killing, and death are all the same thing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Guidelines for the Lord's Table Meeting and the Pursuit in Life &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
