<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Suffering Rebellion from Those among Us</H2><P>Brother Nee also suffered attacks from rebellious ones who were among us. When I was younger, I read the stories about the children of Israel rebelling against Moses. When I came into the church life, I saw such rebellion. Brother Nee suffered not only the attacks from the outsiders but also the attacks and rebellion from those inside the church life.</P><P>I would like to present an example of such attacks suffered by Brother Nee. There was a co-worker among us who fell into immorality. The local leading ones could not handle the situation, so they referred the case to Brother Nee. Brother Nee was forced to deal with this situation, and this brother had to be removed from the fellowship of the church. Later this brother, who had been a co-worker, started to attack Brother Nee. Eventually, he went to Hong Kong to set up another meeting, which was another division. That meeting was set up close to Brother K.H. Weigh's home, but it did not last too long because this rebellious brother eventually died of cancer.</P><P>Before he died, he attacked Brother Nee. This was during the Second World War when Shanghai was taken over by the Japanese army. The Japanese army was afraid of the Communists. When they found out that someone was a Communist, they killed him. At that time the Japanese military police were careful to examine all the mail. When this rebellious brother was in Hong Kong, he sent Brother Nee materials concerning communism so that the Japanese military would think Brother Nee was a communist and arrest him. Brother Nee, however, was under the protection of the Lord, and this mail that was sent to him several times was never discovered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Suffering Defamation<br>and Evil Report from Opposers</H2><P>Brother Nee suffered such attacks from rebellious ones many times. In 1950 Brother Nee came out of China to Hong Kong for the last time. In Hong Kong we were holding meetings every evening. One night when Brother Nee and I walked out of the meeting hall, there were some people standing at the entrance distributing some booklets against him. Some of these booklets were passed to him. He smiled a little bit and did not take them. They were filled with false rumors and other defamatory things that were absolutely against him. This is another illustration of the attacks he suffered.</P>
