   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PHARISEES AND THE HERODIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the Lord Jesus spoke in such a clear way, those foolish ones did not understand at all, and the Pharisees and the Herodians still tried to trap Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Pharisees were a religious party, and the Herodians were a political party.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two parties customarily fought against one another, but on this occasion they cooperated in an attempt to entangle Christ Matt 22:15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The answers of the Lord Jesus in the parables were centered and focused on Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Pharisees and Herodians did not hear a word concerning Christ because they were preoccupied by their concepts and by their evil thoughts of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They considered themselves very clever so they conceived a plot to trap the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They asked Him, "Tell us therefore, What do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was their strategy: if the Lord said yes, then the Pharisees would catch Him, but if He said no, the Herodians would catch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Either way, they thought, He would be caught.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the Lord Jesus was wiser than these evil men and defeated their plan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Pharisees and Herodians thought they were wiser than the Lord, but they did not know that He was their Creator and that they were simply His little creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus said, "Show Me the tribute money" 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They gave Him a coin, and as they did so they lost their case.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus was very wise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not have the money; they did.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regardless of whether or not it is lawful to pay the tax, as long as they had the money, it means they were the ones who had been caught.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are all familiar with the Lord's answer: "Pay then what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God" 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although they had worked so hard to trap Him, it was easy for the Lord Jesus to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must see that it is not a matter of religion or politics; it is altogether a matter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must take care of Christ and not be preoccupied with our own concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are preoccupied with our concepts, we will not be able to receive Christ when He is presented to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to be empty; Christ can then come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE SADDUCEES</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Next to confront the Lord Jesus were the Sadducees, the ancient modernists, who raised a question concerning resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They said that a man married a wife and died without having any children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Jewish custom and the law of Moses, the woman then married the man's brother Deut 25:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He also died without having any children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same thing happened to a total of seven brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So they asked whose wife she would be in the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Sadducees felt that they were smart, and they were confident that they had trapped Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the Lord rebuked them by saying, "You are deceived, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as angels of God in heaven" 22:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In that day there will be no husbands and no wives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living" 22:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since He is the God of the living, surely Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If not, God would be the God of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This answer fully shut their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who can defeat the Lord Jesus?</S>
