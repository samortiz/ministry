   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Son, as the grain of wheat John 12:24 , expected that He would die Luke 12:50 to have His shell of humanity broken that His divine glory might be released with His divine life to produce many grains, that is, many believers as His increase for the building up of His Body for the glorification of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At His last entry into Jerusalem under the exaltation of the people of Israel, some Greeks came to exalt Him, but He told them that that was the hour for Him not to be exalted by man but to be glorified by the Father, that is, to die to have His divine glory and life released in His resurrection John 12:12, 20-24.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is in the second section of this book from 12:20 to 20:29 that the Son was crucified to have His human shell broken and His divine glory and life released in His resurrection for the dispensing of His divine life to His believers with which they could glorify the Father also.</S>
