<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages concerning church service given by Brother Witness Lee in Manila and in Taipei from 1954 to 1956. These messages were published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from 1963 to 1965.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SERVICE BEING FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-11; Eph. 4:12, 15b-16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will speak concerning some basic items of service so that we may understand why we serve and how to serve. In order for us to have a clearer understanding, we will first speak concerning God&rsquo;s intention in this age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ULTIMATE WORK<br />
BEING TO BUILD UP HIS HOUSE</h2>
<p>Most Christians know that God wants the gospel to be preached to sinners and that He wants His lovers to pursue and serve Him. Hence, Christians have always risen up to meet these needs. This is God&rsquo;s doing. Before the Lord ascended into heaven, He commanded the disciples to &ldquo;go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation&rdquo; (Mark 16:15). Besides the Lord&rsquo;s definite command, the Spirit also is always urging and moving us to preach the gospel (Acts 8:29-35; 10:19-22). Therefore, Christians have always been fervent for the gospel.</p>
<p>Likewise, God is always raising up some among His children to love Him, pursue Him, understand His will, and live in His presence. Such spiritual persons abound in the New Testament age. There were not as many lovers of God in the Old Testament age. However, for the past two thousand years a considerable number of believers have risen up to pursue the Lord. Furthermore, the Spirit is working within the believers. We often feel that we are not spiritual enough, that we do not live before the Lord, that we should love Him more, and that we should pursue Him more. Therefore, we listen to spiritual messages, read spiritual publications, and fellowship with spiritual believers so that we may receive spiritual help. This is God&rsquo;s work within us.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient for God&rsquo;s children to preach the gospel and to be spiritual; God wants more than this. He has another category of work. The first two categories of His work are for the third and final category, which is to build up His children into His house in every locality. God wants to establish His house wherever His children are. The church in every locality is an expression of God&rsquo;s house. In this age God wants us to preach the gospel in order to save sinners. He also wants us to lead the new believers to be spiritual for the building up of His house. Preaching the gospel is to gain material for the building of God&rsquo;s house, and leading believers to pursue the Lord and to be edified deals with the material by making it suitable for the building.</p>
<p>In order to build a house, a person must first gather and then prepare materials, after which the materials can be built together into a house. God raises up believers to preach the gospel so that He may obtain materials for His building. Through the Spirit and His ministers, God then perfects and edifies the new believers so that they may be fit for His building. Therefore, both leading people to be saved and leading believers to grow in life are merely procedures. God&rsquo;s ultimate goal is the building up of His house.</p>
<p>If the church can be built up in every locality as the house of God, it will meet God&rsquo;s need as well as man&rsquo;s need. Such a house reveals and expresses God, gives Him the glory He deserves, and accomplishes His will so that He can have rest. When believers rise up to pursue God, His house can meet their need and give them satisfaction. In this house people can touch God, sense warmth, and find rest. God&rsquo;s house is the only place that can give man satisfaction. Although a person may have a home, that home cannot satisfy his inner need. It is not until he enters into God&rsquo;s house that his inner being will be satisfied.</p>
<p>When God builds up the believers in every locality into His house, His children can then tell others that in order to meet God, to know God, to receive peace and rest, to obtain spiritual food and satisfaction, to be enlightened, and to know God&rsquo;s way, they must come to this house, which is the church of God. If a church in a locality is built up, people will sense that God is present. They will have rest, be fed, hear His speaking, and be in His presence. Furthermore, they will know God. God is omnipresent, but if we want to meet God, we must come to His house. This is what God desires to accomplish in this age. God wants the gospel to be preached fervently, and He also wants the believers to pursue spirituality so that His house, the church, the Body of Christ, may be built up. Preaching the gospel and pursuing spirituality are for the building of God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>As God&rsquo;s serving ones, we often see only the first two matters. We know the importance of preaching the gospel and of pursuing spirituality, but we do not know the importance of building up the house of God. This may be likened to collecting materials and preparing them without building a house. We often appreciate persons who preach the gospel and pursue spirituality, thinking that this is quite precious, but we do not see the ultimate goal. We do not see that God&rsquo;s desire is to have a house. This is His purpose. God wants saved and edified believers to be coordinated and built together as His dwelling place.</p>
<p>We are not the only persons who are unclear concerning this matter. Nearly every exposition of the Bible and most spiritual writings cover only the first two matters. Pursuing spirituality and living in the Lord are considered to be the peak of the Christian life. Seldom have believers been told that God wants to obtain an expression of His house in every locality.</p><h2 class="head1">CONSECRATING OURSELVES FOR<br />
THE BUILDING OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the Epistles the apostles wrote that God desires a house. The Epistle to the Romans is concerning the Christian life, but chapter 12 is concerning the Body in coordination. All the saved ones need to become one Body in Christ and be coordinated as members one of another (vv. 4-5). According to man&rsquo;s view, a believer who is spiritual is one who experiences chapters 1 through 8; that is, after believing, he advances to living in the spirit and walking according to the spirit (8:4). However, after chapter 8 the apostle revealed the Body of Christ in chapter 12. In this chapter he exhorted the saints in Rome to consecrate themselves, that is, to present their bodies a living sacrifice, for the realization of the Body of Christ (v. 1). Chapter 12 speaks of the human body and the Body of Christ. It seems as though a believer who is spiritual because he lives in the spirit and walks according to the spirit has reached the peak of the Christian life. However, this is still not adequate. He needs to experience consecration. He needs to present himself as a spiritual person, that is, as a person living in the spirit and walking according to the spirit. He needs to present his body so that he can be a member for the building up of the Body of Christ. God is focused on the Body of Christ. His desire is that we present our bodies to accomplish the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Some saints live in chapter 8. They are spiritual. They walk according to the spirit, and they live in the Lord. Regrettably, however, they are individualistic; they are spiritual individuals. They do not know the church, and they have not seen the Body of Christ. It is true that they are spiritual, but they do not coordinate with other members. They are spiritual by themselves. Their spirituality is isolated and individualistic. They do not know what it means to coordinate with others, that is, to be members one of another. They feel that it is all right to do everything by themselves. They live before God by themselves, read the Bible by themselves, pray by themselves, fellowship with the Lord by themselves, preach the gospel by themselves, and visit other saints by themselves. It is true that they express the condition in chapter 8. They not only walk according to the spirit, but they also know that all things work together to conform them to the image of God&rsquo;s Son (vv. 28-29). Hence, they are able to learn precious lessons of life by accepting the outward dealings in their environment. However, they remain in chapter 8 and do not advance to chapter 12.</p>
<p>Such believers have not entered the experience of consecration according to chapter 12. This experience of consecration does not refer to the experience of consecration that they had at the beginning of their Christian life. Rather, it is the consecration of a rather mature and spiritual Christian. We need the experience of consecrating our spirituality and presenting our bodies to God as a living sacrifice so that we may be members living in the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING MEMBERS ONE OF ANOTHER<br />
TO BECOME ONE BODY</h2>
<p>What does it mean to be members of the Body? Suppose a brother and I are both capable. He can run, and I can run. He can speak, and I can speak. He can do everything, and I can do everything. In this situation neither of us is a member. He is an individual, and I am also an individual. Since we each have a body, we can do everything by ourselves without relying on each other. However, a hand can do only what a hand is meant to do. It must depend on other members to do other things. The hand needs the mouth as well as the feet. Likewise, the mouth needs the hands as well as the feet. Every member needs all the other members.</p>
<p>Being a member is not a matter of doctrine. Being a member is a matter of our seeing and of our consciousness. It is not useful to merely understand the doctrine of being a member. Have we seen that we are a member, and are we conscious of being a member, or do we still consider ourselves to be a body? A body can do everything and knows how to do everything. It can run, it can gesture, it can speak, it can hear, and it can see. A body is all-capable. In contrast, a member can function only according to what it is. The hand is the hand, the eye is the eye, the ear is the ear, and the foot is the foot. First Corinthians 12:21 says, &ldquo;The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.&rdquo; This is what it means to be members one of another.</p>
<p>We should ask ourselves whether we sense a need for the other brothers and sisters. Do we feel that we can read the Bible, pray, give testimonies, shepherd others, and even engage in spiritual warfare by ourselves and that we do not need the other saints? Or do we sense that we are merely members who need the other saints, for without them we cannot do anything? There is a great difference in these two situations. If we are truly living as a member of the Body of Christ, we will sense a need for the other saints in everything.</p>
<p>Take reading the Bible as an example. Although a brother can read the Bible by himself, he still may feel a need to read the Bible with the saints. He needs them to be his eyes and his understanding so that he may have a deeper comprehension of the Bible. The same applies to prayer. Although he can pray by himself, and he also knows how to pray, the other saints often utter what he is unable to utter when he prays alone. He may have a sense within that he is unable to express in prayer, but when another brother prays, that sense is expressed. Thus, even in the matter of prayer we cannot be individuals.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother has been visiting a weak saint, and no matter what the brother does, the saint&rsquo;s condition remains the same. The brother may know and understand the saint&rsquo;s problem and be willing to help solve the problem, but nothing changes. If this brother would be willing to take another brother with him, however, the weak saint would be released. We need other members when we visit the saints.</p>
<p>To know the Body of Christ is to realize that we are only members and that we cannot do anything without others. When I was a young Christian, I felt quite capable, but now I cannot do anything apart from the brothers and sisters. I often have the feeling to ask a brother to pray with me. Even when I give a message, I desire to have four brothers standing next to me&mdash;not sitting in chairs but standing with me. For instance, suppose we have a gospel meeting, and eight thousand people come to listen to the gospel. We can have fifty brothers standing on the podium. When one brother is speaking, the other forty-nine brothers are supporting him. One brother says, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; and forty-nine brothers say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; One brother says, &ldquo;Repent and believe in Jesus,&rdquo; and forty-nine brothers say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; Such a gospel meeting would be full of impact. This was the situation when the apostles preached the gospel at Pentecost.</p>
<p>When the church gathers together to pray, a sister&rsquo;s prayer can touch others. However, if the same sister prays by herself, her prayer will not have so much inspiration. She might run out of words after three or five sentences. It is amazing that when she prays with other saints, words pour forth. This is the supply of the Body. This is the mutual supply among the members.</p>
<p>When I give messages from the podium, it seems as if I am the one speaking. However, I can speak because the saints are here. The words that I speak come from the Body and are through the Body. If no one were in this room, I surely would not be able to continue after speaking five sentences. It is because of you that I am able to speak continually and unceasingly. Hence, even in giving messages we need the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Every believer is but a member. You may be as small as a little finger, or you may be as big as an arm. No matter what you are, you are simply a member, and as such, you need to be coordinated with other members. Every believer must mature to the extent that he cannot be separated from other believers.</p>
<p>Some brothers pray for the subject of a message. A subject obtained in this way is not the issue of prayer; it is actually &ldquo;dug out&rdquo; from the mind. This is not God&rsquo;s way. Paul did not pray for a subject before he wrote the Epistles to the Corinthians, nor did Peter or John pray for a subject before writing an Epistle. The Epistles were not written in this way. Paul wrote the first Epistle to the Corinthians because he was in contact with the church in Corinth and knew their problems. These problems became the source of his subject. For example, there were divisions and strifes among the Corinthians (1:10-11), so he wrote to them concerning Christ, saying, &ldquo;Is Christ divided?&rdquo; (v. 13). He also said, &ldquo;If there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man? For when someone says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men of flesh?&rdquo; (3:3-4). This example shows that the believers were the source of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p>
<p>Whenever I do not have a subject for a message, I fellowship with some brothers and ask, &ldquo;Brothers, how are you? What is the situation of the saints? How are the meetings in your district?&rdquo; From what they say, I receive a subject for a message. As a result, the saints feel that the messages are relevant and practical. Little do they realize that they have supplied my subject and my words.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is for us to be members one of another and thereby become one Body. God does not want people merely to be saved or to be spiritual. He wants much more. He wants people to become members of the Body of Christ and of His household. He wants people to be saved and believers to be spiritual so that they may become the Body, which is also His house. The church is the Body and the house of God. To Christ, the church is His Body; to God, the church is His house. This is what God desires. We must see this in order to have the consciousness that we are merely members who need other saints. We need to be coordinated together. We cannot be independent Christians, nor can we be individualistic. God wants a house, and we need this house. Christ wants a Body, and we need this Body. We must have such a clear vision of this need and a strong consciousness of this need.</p>
<p>Many saints are not satisfied with their local church. Some have said, &ldquo;Since the condition of the church is so poor, I do not need to go to the meetings anymore. I will read the Bible and pray by myself.&rdquo; This sounds reasonable, but those who stop attending the meetings eventually fall away. It seems as though the church meetings are of little profit and that it is better to read the Bible and pray alone. However, a short while after they stop attending the meetings, they stop reading the Bible and praying as well. Eventually, they end up watching movies instead. Even the weakest meeting is a help to us. At the very least, it can keep us from falling. We need to see that a Christian cannot be alone. We must remain in the church. We must know this fact and have this consciousness.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Here are a few points concerning the way to practice this fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Placing Ourselves in the Church</h2>
<p>If we have seen God&rsquo;s desire and sense our need, we must resolve to place ourselves in the church. We should settle this matter once for all. Whether or not the church is strong, we must put ourselves in the church. This must be our determination and decision. Some saints do not have such a resolve, and as a result, their spiritual condition will not be healthy. If we want to pursue spirituality, to serve God, and to preach the gospel, we cannot be individualistic; rather, we must be in the church. We must have a determination to be in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Submitting to the Headship of Christ</h2>
<p>We need to learn the lesson of submitting to the headship of Christ. This lesson requires a thorough consecration in which we recognize the Lord as our Head and acknowledge His authority and position in all things. Ephesians 4:15 says that we should &ldquo;grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; In order for us to be in a proper condition in the church, we must be under the authority of the Head. Without a proper relationship with the Head, we cannot have a proper relationship with the other believers in the church. This is not a matter of doctrine. We must learn the serious lesson of maintaining a proper relationship with the Head, Christ, by being ruled by Him in all things, that is, letting Him be the Lord in all matters, whether great or small. If we are willing to submit to the headship of Christ in this way, those who come into our midst will sense that Christ is our Head. No one in the church can take the place of Christ. Everyone needs to honor Him as the Lord and take Him as the Head.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Accepting the Breaking</h2>
<p>Not only should we have a proper relationship with the Head, but we must also maintain a proper relationship with the brothers and sisters. Not only should we submit ourselves to the headship of Christ, but we must also be fitly joined together with the brothers and sisters. This requires that we learn the lessons of being broken. I can coordinate with any responsible brother and with any elder. I have no problem coordinating with the co-workers as well as with the saints. It does not matter whether a person is elderly or young; I can coordinate with him. I have a proper relationship with the Head and also with the saints. In order to have a proper relationship with the Head, we need to submit to the authority of the Head, but in order to have a proper relationship with the saints, we need to be willing to be broken.</p>
<p>If we are not willing to be broken in relation to a particular matter, sooner or later we will have problems with the saints in that matter. Therefore, we need to learn serious lessons. A person who is broken will depend not only on God but also on the saints. This is not referring to depending on the saints in financial matters or general matters. We need to learn to rely on the saints in spiritual matters. We need to rely on the saints in order to live before the Lord and to serve Him. We must have the consciousness that we cannot serve God by ourselves; we must be joined to the saints and rely on them. This is not doctrine. It must be our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living before God</h2>
<p>We need to learn to live before God. On the one hand, we need to depend on the saints, and on the other hand, we should learn to live before the Lord, to read His Word, to pray in fellowship with Him, and to fear Him. We should not say, &ldquo;There are many brothers and sisters. Some of them give messages, and others administrate the church. I will run errands and let them take care of the spiritual matters.&rdquo; This is not right. Every saint needs to draw near to the Lord, to pray, to read His Word, and to fellowship with Him, always living in the shining of His face.</p>
<p>We do not have enough experience. The authority of the Head is not adequately expressed through us. The position of the Head is not sufficiently manifest among us. Hence, we lack the element of submitting to the Head. We have not fully learned the lessons of being broken. Sometimes we criticize the saints, the elders, and the responsible ones. Criticisms prove that we are not broken. A believer who is broken does not have anything to say, even if the elders are wrong or the saints are somewhat undesirable. A believer who is broken does not have opinions. Rather, he is submissive to God. Such a believer feels that he is short and seldom notices others&rsquo; mistakes.</p>
<p>We do not depend on one another as members of the Body, because we are not broken. Being confident in ourselves and not needing the other members in order to visit the saints or to give a message are the expression of death, not life. Being confident in ourselves is a tearing down of the Body, not the building up. It issues in spiritual heroes who can do everything but who do not have God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>When we submit to the authority of the Head and accept the breaking, we will realize our need to rely on the saints in all things. Those who give messages will rely on the other brothers. The sisters will depend on one another for spiritual matters. Then when people come into our midst, they will sense that God is among us. The Spirit will move in our midst, and God&rsquo;s intention will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>As we depend on one another, we will also learn to fear God, to live in His presence, and to have a private life of reading the Bible and praying, and we will learn the lessons of being broken. As a result, we will not be confused; rather, we will each walk before the Lord and express Him.</p>
<p>The church will be strong, bright, rich, and glorious. The gospel will be powerful, and the saints will be edified. Every meeting and every aspect of service will have the Lord&rsquo;s presence so that when people enter, they will declare, &ldquo;This is God&rsquo;s house!&rdquo; They will receive rest, be nourished, and meet God. This is the building that God desires.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BASIS OF SERVICE&mdash;<br />
THE FIRE FROM THE ALTAR</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 6:3-9; Luke 12:49-50; 1 Cor. 3:12-15; Heb. 12:28-29; Rev. 1:13-14</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRE FROM THE ALTAR BEING<br />
THE BASE OF OUR SERVICE TO GOD</h2>
<p>Every service to God must be based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering. In the Old Testament the priests burned incense before God. The burning of incense symbolizes the service rendered to God by man. The fire used to burn the incense had to be taken from the altar of burnt offering (Lev. 16:12-13). If a person did not burn incense with the fire from the altar of burnt offering, that is, if he offered strange fire, his service was not accepted by God, and he suffered the judgment of death (10:1-2). This example shows that our service to God must be based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel followed the tabernacle in their journey through the wilderness, their service before God began with the burning of the fire on the altar of burnt offering. The fire on the altar of burnt offering descended from God (9:24). The children of Israel could not begin their service to God until the fire descended. Although they had been delivered by God out of Egypt, had crossed the Red Sea, and had raised up the tabernacle at the foot of Mount Sinai, they could not serve God, because they did not have a basis for their service. The basis of their service was the altar of burnt offering with fire burning upon it. It was not adequate to have the altar of burnt offering. The altar had to have the fire that descended from God.</p>
<p>God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt so that they might serve Him (Exo. 3:12; 9:1). After the Israelites were rescued out of Egypt, they were in a position to serve God. However, they could not serve Him, because they did not have the altar. Even after the tabernacle was raised up and the altar of burnt offering was put before the entrance of the tabernacle, the children of Israel still could not serve God, because fire had not yet descended from heaven. At the beginning of Leviticus God was before the Israelites, yet they still could not serve Him. It was not until chapter 9 that God led them to do what was necessary for fire to come down from heaven.</p>
<p>The offering of the burnt offering was the prerequisite for fire to descend from heaven. Merely having the altar was not sufficient; the burnt offering had to be placed on the altar. After the sacrifice of the burnt offering was killed, skinned, cut, washed, and placed on the altar, fire could descend from heaven. God wanted the service of the children of Israel to be based on this fire. The burning of incense was their service to God, but the fire used for burning incense had to be taken from the altar. Hence, the service that we render to God must originate from the fire on the altar of burnt offering, and our service must be the issue of the burning of this fire.</p>
<p>Instead of using the fire from the altar, Nadab and Abihu used their own fire to burn incense in their service to God (10:1). Consequently, their service was not accepted by God, and they suffered the judgment of death (v. 2). This incident is a warning from God that our service must be based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering. We cannot use any energy other than this fire. Every item of the service of the children of Israel before God issued out of the fire burning on the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p>Fire is a source of energy. Everything that moves in the physical world uses energy, and energy is produced through burning. In order for our service to be full of energy, our service must pass through the fire on the altar. This is not strange fire, which is of man and of the earth. Rather, this is holy fire. This fire is of God and of heaven. Our service must come out of the burning of God&rsquo;s fire. This fire should be the energy, the driving force, the impulse within us. Then our service will be out of God, not out of ourselves.</p>
<p>God accepted the service of the Israelites based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering. Shortly after entering the land of Canaan, the children of Israel failed, became desolate, and the Ark was carried away. As a result, the people could not serve God properly. After a period of desolation, David was raised up by God. David had a desire to serve God and to build a house for God. This desire was fulfilled through his son Solomon. After Solomon finished building the temple, he took the bronze altar, the altar of burnt offering, and put it in the temple. He also offered sacrifices and the burnt offering upon the altar (2 Chron. 7:1). At that time, the service to God was resumed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the service of the children of Israel in the temple was based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering. Every time they burned incense and served before God, they had to pass through the altar of burnt offering. They had to use the fire taken from the altar to burn incense. The fire was kept burning on the altar continually until the destruction of the temple (Lev. 6:13).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the tabernacle of God, the temple of God (John 1:14; 2:21). Any people who had the desire to serve God had to serve through the Lord Jesus. They had to go to Him. The Lord also set up an altar&mdash;the cross on Golgotha&mdash;and offered Himself upon it as the burnt offering. Then one day fire came down. This fire was the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4). The Lord Jesus Himself was willing to go to the cross and offer Himself to God. He also led Peter, John, James, and the rest of His lovers and followers to offer themselves to God, just as He did. Therefore, God accepted them as a satisfying fragrance of Christ (cf. 2 Cor. 2:15). Before Pentecost a hundred and twenty lovers of Jesus gathered in an upper room in Jerusalem (Acts 1:13-15) and presented themselves to God. As a result, on the day of Pentecost the Spirit descended upon them as tongues of fire. This was the beginning of the New Testament service. The New Testament service began on the day of Pentecost with the fire that came down and began to burn.</p>
<p>The energy and the motivating power for the New Testament service did not originate in man, that is, in the Galilean fishermen. The energy and the motivating power for the New Testament service began with fire from heaven. The fire that descended upon the Galilean fishermen became the energy and the motivating power within them. After the day of Pentecost they could speak for God, preach the gospel, save sinners, and establish churches. The disciples were not the source of the power for their work. The source of that power was heaven; the power came from the fire that descended from heaven.</p>
<p>At the time of Pentecost there was a great number of people in Jerusalem. However, the fire descended only on the hundred and twenty because they were on the altar of burnt offering. The fire of the Spirit descends only on the altar of burnt offering. This was not the fire of judgment, which will come in the future. This was the fire of salvation (Luke 12:49). This fire burns on those who love God, who offer themselves to God, who are willing to forsake everything for God, and who are willing to place themselves in His hands in order to be slain and broken. Their service to God is the issue of the burning. Whether in the Old Testament type or in the New Testament reality, man&rsquo;s service to God always comes out of the fire from the altar.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FIRE FROM THE ALTAR BEING THE GENUINE MOTIVATING POWER OF SERVICE</h2>
<p>The only thing that God does concerning man&rsquo;s service is to send His fire to burn within man. To serve God and to work for Him mean that man is joined to God and is mingled with God. It seems as though man is serving God. However, the service comes out of God; it does not originate in man. The service is God moving through man. Without the human element, there cannot be service. However, if there is only the human element, the service is not acceptable to God. In order for our service to have spiritual value and be acceptable to God, He must move through us and serve through us. This is the purpose of the altar. God is calling those who love Him and desire to satisfy His heart&rsquo;s desire to offer themselves on the altar.</p>
<p>In Romans 12:1 the apostle Paul exhorts us to present our bodies a living sacrifice. This means that we must pay the price to forsake everything of ourselves. If we are willing to present ourselves on the altar, the divine fire will come down on us and pass through us. The issue of this burning will be our service, our work. On the one hand, such a work may be considered our work because we have a part in it; on the other hand, it is not our work because it is not out of us. This work is God working through us by being joined to us.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it was Peter who stood up on the day of Pentecost to preach the gospel (Acts 2:14-41); on the other hand, it was God who preached the gospel. It was the fire of God burning in Peter and speaking through Peter. This is an example of man being gained by God and of God being gained by man. God and man were joined and mingled together.</p>
<p>This is the service that God desires. When iron is being purified in fire, the iron seems to be swallowed up by the fire, but at the same time, the fire seems to burn in the iron. The iron becomes red because fire is burning in the iron. Then the fire burns wherever the iron is placed. We may say that it is a rod of iron, or we may say that it is a ball of fire. The fire and the iron become one. This is an illustration of the Christian service and work.</p>
<p>Genuine Christian service is not of man. Rather, genuine Christian service is God moving through man. God does not force man to receive Him. God has erected an altar, and those who are willing, those who love Him, may come forward willingly to be dealt with, broken, and placed on the altar. Such a person can say, &ldquo;Lord, here I am. My only desire is to satisfy Your need.&rdquo; If we would offer ourselves sincerely in this way, fire will descend from heaven and burn us. This burning will become the energy that moves us. The issue of this burning will be our service. God wants His fire to burn in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD COMING<br />
TO CAST FIRE ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>Some of us might say that the Lord Jesus came to the earth &ldquo;to seek and to save that which is lost&rdquo; (Luke 19:10). Others might quote another verse and say that &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:15). This also is a wonderful verse. Some might quote John 10:10, which says, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; We are familiar with these verses. However, in Luke 12:49 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come to cast fire on the earth.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus came to the earth not only to save us but to cause fire to burn on us. &ldquo;I have come to cast fire on the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord cast fire on the earth so that it might be kindled. Therefore, the Lord continued, &ldquo;How I wish that it were already kindled!&rdquo; (v. 49). The Lord desired that the fire would be kindled in people. Verse 50 says, &ldquo;I have a baptism to be baptized with.&rdquo; The baptism with which the Lord was to be baptized was His death on the cross. If the Lord had not died, the fire would not have been cast down. The Lord had to die. He had to take up the cross, go to the altar, and present Himself as a burnt offering.</p>
<p>If the Lord had not placed Himself in the Father&rsquo;s hand, the fire could not have been cast to the earth. This fire is the Spirit. When the Lord Jesus went to the cross and suffered death, He was gained by God, and God poured out the Spirit as fire from heaven. This fire descended on the hundred and twenty disciples and burned in them. All the service in the New Testament age comes out of that burning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRE ON THE ALTAR BURNING AND<br />
PRODUCING A POWERFUL SERVICE</h2>
<p>Now we will consider how to apply this fellowship. We need to know what the Christian service is and what the work of the church is. We cannot start a service or initiate a work simply because we like it or are enthusiastic. To do so would be to serve God with strange fire, because the service would be of man, not of God. Strange fire is unacceptable to God. It is not what He wants.</p>
<p>The service that God desires is carried out through the fire on the altar of burnt offering. The altar of burnt offering has already been set up, and fire has also descended upon it. The altar of burnt offering is the cross of the Lord Jesus, and the fire is the Spirit. The Spirit has descended and is burning through the cross as the altar of burnt offering. Any person who is willing to touch the cross, that is, to receive the cross by applying the death of Christ, will be gained by God. Then the fire on the altar of burnt offering, that is, the Spirit, will burn in him until it produces a service. All genuine service comes out of such a burning.</p>
<p>There was a young brother who was born into a good family and was loved by his parents. One day he learned of the salvation of the cross and received it. Then something unexplainable happened in him; the fire of the Spirit burned in him. The more he prayed and the closer he drew to the Lord, the more the fire burned within him. Finally, he said, &ldquo;Lord, I consecrate myself to You willingly. I do not care about my future, and I do not care about my possessions. I am willing to be wrecked, slain, and broken. I am willing to meet Your need and let my life be terminated on the cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more he prayed, the stronger the fire burned within him. The fire became so intense that the young brother would weep for unsaved sinners around him. The zeal burning in him and moving him was so intense that he had to preach the gospel. He was beside himself for the gospel. This was an experience of the fire on the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p>When this young brother was about twenty years old, he was studying with a determination to achieve something in the future. Then one day he heard that a young lady would be preaching the gospel in his town, and he was full of curiosity because at that time in northern China it was unheard of for a young lady to preach the gospel in public. Even though he was very busy, he went to listen to her because he wanted to see the situation.</p>
<p>The young lady spoke concerning how God needs man and wants to gain man and how Satan usurps man in order to prevent God from gaining man. She spoke from the book of Exodus. Her words penetrated the young brother, and every sentence burned in him.</p>
<p>He forgot that he was there as a spectator, and his inner being was subdued by her speaking. He confessed that he wanted to be gained by God. After listening to the message, he believed in the Lord, was saved, and his life changed. He said, &ldquo;Even if Satan would give me the whole world, I do not want it. I do not want anything. I want to forsake the world. I want to leave Egypt, which is under Pharaoh&rsquo;s usurpation. Satan, the Pharaoh of this world, has usurped me. I want to go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the Lord&rsquo;s grace, many years later this brother served God together with the sister who had preached the gospel to him. That was when he learned of how she was saved. She believed in the Lord while attending a Christian school. Later, she was revived and consecrated herself to serve the Lord after hearing the gospel from another young woman. Those who are acquainted with the history of Christianity in China know that in the early part of the twentieth century a woman by the name of Dora Yu was greatly used by the Lord. Dora Yu was a native of Chekiang Province.</p>
<p>Sister Yu grew up in a wealthy family and received a good education from her youth. After she graduated from medical school, her parents sent her to England to further her studies. While she was on the ship sailing to England, she spent much time with the Lord in prayer and was brought by the Lord to the altar. As soon as she was placed on the altar, the fire of the Spirit began to burn in her. By the time her ship was in the Mediterranean Sea, the fire within her was burning so fiercely that she felt she could not go to England to study.</p>
<p>Sister Yu wondered how she could turn back, because her parents had already spent a large sum of money to pay for her travel expenses and tuition. In those days, it was extremely difficult to be trained as a medical doctor. Nevertheless, the fire kept burning within her, urging her to get off the ship and return to China in order to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>When the ship arrived at Marseille, Sister Yu told the captain that she had to go back to China. Although the people on the ship thought that she was crazy, she got off the ship in Marseille and found another ship going to China.</p>
<p>When she returned home, her family was very disappointed. They asked her why she decided to return home. The more she explained her desire to preach the gospel to the Chinese people, the more her family considered her to be crazy. They said that her believing in Jesus had caused her to become confused and insane.</p>
<p>Her family and relatives tried to counsel her, but they could not change her mind. The more she prayed, the more intensely the fire burned within her. Eventually, her family let her leave home. Under the burning of the fire of the Spirit, Sister Yu went to Shanghai, where she was without a home. She wanted to preach Jesus so that people might repent and be saved.</p>
<p>Sister Yu met someone who loved the Lord and who, understanding her desire, rented a house for her. Then she began to preach the gospel. As a result of the fire of the Spirit burning within her, her preaching of the gospel was powerful. Afterward, she went to preach the gospel in Foochow, and Brother Watchman Nee was saved through her preaching. Some have testified that while she was preaching from the podium, those listening to her wept. They wept so hard that there were puddles of tears on the floor. Through preaching the gospel she was able to lead many to repentance and salvation, and others were revived.</p>
<p>Our work is related to that burning of the Spirit within Sister Dora Yu. This work was produced out of the burning of the Spirit. Human initiation, promotion, discussion, or motivation are not the basis of genuine service to God. The basis of genuine service is knowing the cross and placing ourselves on the cross in order to be gained by God and to allow the divine fire to burn within us. This produces service.</p>
<p>Such service is the burning of incense in the Holy Place, is accepted by God, brings man to God, and joins God to man and heaven to earth. Such a work is of God, passes through God, and goes back to God. This work comes from God to man, it brings man to touch God, and it brings God to pass through man. The continual cycle of coming from God to man and from man to God is the story of the burning of the fire of the Spirit. The only basis for this burning is our being on the altar.</p>
<p>The saints who pray and apply the death of the cross will receive grace from God, and His holy fire will burn within them. Such saints do not care for themselves or set their mind on themselves but care only to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. Their work will be the issue of God moving through man. Their work will be a sweet smelling fragrance to God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK PRODUCED THROUGH BURNING BEING GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES</h2>
<p>Those who experience the altar of burnt offering build with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). Gold refers to the divine life and nature. Silver refers to Christ&rsquo;s redemption and to the principle of the cross. Precious stones refer to God&rsquo;s image. The work of believers who experience the altar of burnt offering is full of the element of God, has the power of the cross, and expresses God.</p>
<p>Those who do not experience the altar of burnt offering work according to what they are. They build with wood, grass, and stubble (v. 12). Wood refers to the nature of the natural man. Grass refers to the man of the flesh (1 Pet. 1:24). Stubble refers to things grown out of the earth, earthly things. Human methods and common practices in society are of the earth, not of heaven. Precious stones denote the heavenly atmosphere; in contrast, stubble denotes the earthly situation. Only work that is produced through burning is of gold, silver, and precious stones. The work that is not produced through burning is of wood, grass, and stubble.</p>
<p>The day will come when the work of each will be tested by fire (1 Cor. 3:13). If our work is the issue of fire, our work will stand the test of fire. Gold, silver, and precious stones are of God and are produced through His burning. As such, the work of gold, silver, and precious stones will endure being tested by God&rsquo;s fire. Furthermore, those who carry out such a work will receive a reward (v. 14). If our work is according to the natural man, by the flesh, and earthy, it is of wood, grass, and stubble. When the work of each is manifested by fire, such a work will not endure the test but will be consumed, and we will suffer loss (v. 15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE KINDS OF BURNING</h2>
<p>Those who have a desire to serve God must remember that our God is a consuming fire (Heb. 12:29). When God comes to the earth, fire comes to the earth. When God enters into man, fire enters into man and burns in him. The degree of burning may be different, but every believer experiences being burned. God is not cold. He is fire that energizes and burns. Those who draw near to God experience the burning. God is a consuming fire, and His eyes are like a flame of fire (Rev. 1:14). Whoever touches Him will be burned.</p>
<p>The divine fire burns on the altar for acceptance and for salvation. A person who is willing to come to the altar will be saved and accepted. If a person approaches God according to his concept, instead of being burned on the altar, he will be consumed, just as Nadab and Abihu were consumed by fire. Nadab and Abihu did not touch the fire on the altar of burnt offering. As a result, they were consumed by God at the incense altar. If we are not willing to be burned at the altar of burnt offering, we will be burned at the incense altar. If we will not let the cross kill us, one day the eyes that are like a flame of fire will burn us. God is a consuming fire, and He will burn us either way.</p>
<p>Someone might stubbornly say, &ldquo;I will not be a Christian; then I will escape the burning.&rdquo; Every Christian will surely be burned either in this age or in the coming age. However, if you are not a Christian, you will definitely be burned in the end. Even the devil will ultimately be burned by fire (20:10). All those who are not found written in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire (v. 15). No one can avoid being tested by fire. If we know the Bible, we also know that the destination of the old creation is the burning of fire (2 Pet. 3:7, 10, 12).</p>
<p>Those who are willing to be burned on the altar of the cross today will be accepted and saved by God in that day. However, those who are not willing to be burned by the cross will one day suffer loss before God, just as Nadab and Abihu suffered loss. Contrarily, those who reject salvation and the Savior will end up in the lake of fire. No one can avoid the fire of God.</p>
<p>These words are not intended to threaten anyone. The corrupted human race, the natural man, needs to go through fire. However, there are three kinds of burning. The first kind is the burning at the altar, which is for salvation and acceptance. It is precious and glorious. The issue of this burning is that we become a sweet fragrance to God, and we have the appearance of precious stones. The second kind of burning is for the believers who are not willing to be dealt with or to be broken. One day their work will be proved by fire. They will suffer loss, but they themselves will be saved, yet so as through fire. These two kinds of burning are for believers. The third kind of burning is for those who reject the Lord and His salvation. These people will be cast into the lake of fire forever. Everyone will be burned; no one can escape.</p>
<p>The best kind of burning is the burning on the altar of burnt offering. This is sweet and glorious. May the Lord have mercy on us and show us where we should stand and what we should do. The service in the New Testament is not of us but of Him working through us. We should place ourselves on the altar of the cross, not pitying or loving ourselves, but rather hating and dealing with the self by putting everything we have on the altar in order to be gained by God. Then fire will descend on the altar to burn us. The issue of this burning will be a service. May the Lord grant us grace.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">FOUR MAJOR ITEMS OF SERVICE&mdash;<br />
LIFE, THE TRUTH, THE CHURCH,<br />
AND THE GOSPEL</h1>
<p>In our service we should pay attention to four major items&mdash;life, the truth, the church, and the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE</h2>
<p>We need to pay attention to life, the divine life. This is the base of all things. Not only spiritual matters are based on life; worldly matters are also based on life. The things that we do depend on the life that we have. In the church life we cannot have religious services or organized activities. Our service can come only from life. The service of the church and the testimony of the church are based on life. Hence, we cannot neglect life, nor should we be detached from life. We should take Christ as the base and the source of our service, and our service should be the issue of life. It is by the divine life that we live before God, and it is in this life that we have our being, our living, and our service.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have paid sufficient attention to the knowledge and experience of life. We have given messages concerning life, and we have learned practical lessons on life. The saints have been led to pursue the four stages of life and have properly learned the lessons in each stage. We have terminated the things of the past and offered ourselves to the Lord. We are learning to live before Him, walk according to the Spirit, and do His will in all things. We have given messages concerning dealing with sins, the world, our conscience, the flesh, the self, and our spirit. We are learning to abide in the Lord, to fellowship with Him, to live within the veil, and to have a mingled living with the Lord. On a deeper level we are learning that the church is the Body of Christ. We are not perfecting the Body life with the natural life. In the resurrection life of Christ we are fellow members with the saints, we are coordinated into one Body, and we have the service of the Body. We are learning to keep our position as members in the Body, and we are learning spiritual warfare and spiritual dealings. The saints have learned some lessons in all these matters. These lessons determine the basis of our service and give our service weight. Our service is based on learning these lessons.</p>
<p>We have also spoken concerning the cross. In order to serve in coordination, we must receive the breaking of the cross. If we do not apply the cross to deal with our flesh, the self, and the natural life, it will not be easy for us to coordinate with other saints and serve in harmony and in oneness. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, in the past we were blessed with harmony because the saints were led to know that the cross has terminated our flesh, our self, and our natural life. As a result, we coordinated and served together under the termination of the cross. We did not quarrel or express opinions. Even the slightest differing views were trampled beneath our feet. We worship the Lord because He has indeed been the Head among us. He has obtained the position He deserves, He has obtained our exaltation, and He has obtained the church&rsquo;s worship. Although we have many weaknesses, our little strength has not been consumed with negative problems. The above points are related to life.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not neglect the base of life. Every responsible brother must learn serious lessons concerning life. He should at least have the experience of the first two stages of being in Christ and of abiding in Christ (see <em>The Experience of Life</em>). We need to fellowship with the Lord, have dealings, and consecrate ourselves. We also need to deal with sins, the world, our conscience, and obey the teaching of the anointing. These experiences are the base of our service. We must not neglect these experiences. Furthermore, we should bring this pursuit of life to our various localities so that the saints may also be led to pursue the growth in life. The saints should not only love the Lord zealously but also pursue to know the Lord as life and learn to live in this life. Such a pursuit, leading, and atmosphere should be in every home meeting. This is the principle. The responsible saints should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning the details of carrying out this principle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We must pay attention to the truth. The truth is our constitution. When we speak of the truth, we are referring to what is revealed in the Bible. Our living, walk, service, and administration of the church should not be according to our own view, the world, or deformed Christianity. We must do everything according to the Bible. The indwelling Spirit needs the Bible in our hands, and the Bible needs the Spirit within us. The Spirit within is our life, and the Bible is our truth. The atmosphere of our service should give people the impression that everything we do is according to the truth in the Bible. Every matter, no matter how great or small, should be done according to the truth. We would not propose, initiate, create, or decide any matter according to our will. Rather, everything we do should be based on the Bible.</p>
<p>The responsible saints should have the habit and atmosphere of reading the Bible, and they should bring the saints into the habit and atmosphere of reading the Bible. We want to receive the nourishment of life, the bread of life, from the Bible. We also want to see light in the truth of the Bible so that we may know the Lord&rsquo;s way in our living, walk, work, and service. Everything that we do should have the truth as its standard. We are not an organization with regulations, nor do we follow a creed. We have only the Bible. As much as possible, we should endeavor to serve according to the truth.</p>
<p>We will be enlivened when we live in the divine life and walk according to the truth. Furthermore, our service will be secure. The divine life enlivens us, and the truth protects us. When we have both life and the truth, we will not easily encounter problems in our service. Otherwise, we will be in peril. If we emphasize the truth and neglect the divine life, we will become dead. If we emphasize the divine life and neglect the truth, we will lose our protection and be vulnerable to improper activities and unsound behavior. A locomotive needs the supply of fire, water, and air in order to move. It also needs railroad tracks to secure its movement. Likewise, our service must be built on the two bases of life and the truth in order for our service to be full of life and secure.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we need life and the truth for the church, which is our service, our testimony, and our Christian living. On the other hand, our Christian living is not practical without the church. Our living is the church. Without the church there is no living. In the same principle, although testifying for the Lord is an individual matter, if there were only one Christian in the church, there would not be a testimony. Therefore, our testimony is also the church.</p>
<p>Similarly, our service is the church. The life that we have received is not only a holy life; it is a serving life. We cannot be satisfied with only a holy living. We need a serving life in order to be satisfied. Although we may often feel that serving is tiring, if we stopped our service, nothing would satisfy us, and we would be restless. Our physical life needs water; hence, we feel thirsty when we do not drink. Likewise, our spiritual life needs service; otherwise, we will be thirsty. However, a Christian cannot serve by himself. In order to serve, he must be in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meeting</h2>
<p>The church is our living, our testimony, and also our service. Our living in life and walking according to the truth are for the service of the church. The first item concerning the service of the church is the meetings. We must have meetings, and we must know how to meet. Whether the condition of a locality is good or bad, living or dead, or strong or weak depends on the condition of the meetings. Whether or not the service in a locality can bring in blessing depends on the condition of the meetings. If the meetings in a locality are strong and living, there will be much blessing. Therefore, in order to take care of the service of the church, we must pay attention to our meetings. The various meetings must be strengthened, enriched, refreshed, and enlivened. The responsible brothers must learn how to meet. If the meetings can be carried out in a living, fresh, strong, and rich way, the saints will be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Visitation</h2>
<p>Another item in the service of the church is visitation. When we neglect visitation, the church suffers a great loss. The church can be likened to a family. A family with only adults between the ages of thirty and fifty does not have a promising future, because its members will gradually get older and die. In order for a family to prosper and flourish, its members need to include the elderly, the middle-aged, the young people, and the children. A family with six adults and many children has a promising future.</p>
<p>A family with only adults does not need much care. This is also true of the church. It is not normal for every believer in a locality to be an experienced Christian. The church is a family with older believers and younger believers. A locality with many newly-saved believers needs much visitation and care. This is our responsibility.</p>
<p>In the church, service meetings are of primary importance, followed by visitation. The word <em>visitation</em> implies shepherding and teaching. To shepherd is to give food, and to teach is to impart the truth. The gifts to the Body include shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11). We cannot expect every saint to function in this way, but we should at least expect every responsible saint to do the work of shepherding and teaching. This can be likened to the older siblings in a family being able to prepare food for their younger siblings or to help them with their homework.</p>
<p>A church that lacks proper shepherding and teaching cannot be built up. Degraded and deformed Christianity does not care for shepherding and teaching. Catholics rely on priests, and Protestants rely on pastors, but in the Lord&rsquo;s churches every member should function to supply their fellow members. The responsible saints are more experienced and have learned more lessons before the Lord. Hence, they should endeavor to supply the younger saints in the meetings and in private visitations. Such visitation is shepherding and teaching.</p>
<p>The responsible ones should serve mainly by leading the meetings and visiting the saints. The responsible ones should not run the meetings. They should lead the meetings so that the meetings are living and strong. The responsible ones should also have thorough coordination concerning care for the saints. All the saints&mdash;whether they are weak, backsliding, dormant, sick, or unemployed, or have financial needs, family troubles, or marital problems, or have suffered the loss of a family member&mdash;should receive shepherding and care. The responsible ones must have a clear understanding of the human and spiritual needs of every saint in order to provide proper leading and help.</p>
<p>Visiting the saints and thorough fellowship are not merely an ideal; they are practical. If we can care for every brother and sister, there will be many opportunities for them to be active and serve both in the meetings and individually. According to his growth, a brother can be given some responsibility to serve in visiting others. The purpose of our gospel activities is to bring in more new ones who can learn to take care of other believers. This is our family custom. Every saint should have a spiritual living and produce spiritual children. Then the church will gradually spread.</p><h2 class="head2">Fellowship</h2>
<p>There must be fellowship in order to have church service. Hence, we should endeavor to fellowship. We should contact and fellowship with the saints before and after the meetings. In addition, the responsible ones need to fellowship with one another often. Our fellowship should not be limited to a particular matter. Our fellowship might be concerning a brother who has not been meeting lately or concerning the gospel. According to the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we can fellowship about anything, whether it is concerning the pursuit of life, the knowledge of the truth, or motivating others for church service.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to invite the saints to a love feast in order to fellowship with them. We can invite everyone in the district to the love feast or have love feasts in the homes of the brothers and sisters. For instance, I can invite the brothers in my group meeting to have fellowship in my home, a responsible sister might invite the sisters in her group meeting to have fellowship in her home, or I can invite two families to my home for fellowship. Every responsible one should endeavor to fellowship with the saints. Through such fellowship unsaved family members can be brought to salvation, and the love of those who are cold can be rekindled. If the responsible ones in a locality focus on the meetings, visitation, and fellowship, the locality will be living, strong, and fresh.</p>
<p>A locality that neglects the meetings, visitation, or fellowship will not be strong. A locality that does not have meetings will be dead, and a locality without visitation and fellowship will be weak. Therefore, we must have meetings, visitation, and fellowship. The more fellowship we have the better.</p>
<p>In the church life we do not try to solve problems, but we endeavor to fellowship. Every problem is resolved with fellowship, for fellowship is the blood circulation of the Body. Doctors say that a person with normal blood circulation is healthy and less vulnerable to disease. A lack of fellowship issues in opinions and negotiation, which in turn produce problems. Therefore, we should not rely on negotiation but on fellowship. Fellowship is the means by which the spiritual blood circulates; that is, the grace of life flows. Hence, there should be continual fellowship among the saints. Misunderstandings, ignorance, and opinions are the result of a lack of fellowship. When we have thorough fellowship, your thought becomes mine, my thought becomes yours, and we spontaneously have the same blended and mingled thought. All the problems among the saints can be solved through fellowship.</p>
<p>The meetings are for supplying, propagating, motivating, and perfecting. Visitation is for shepherding and teaching. Fellowship is communion that lets life both solve the problems among us and supply our needs. In the church service every locality should pay attention to these three matters: meeting, visitation, and fellowship. I hope that the responsible ones in every local church will focus on these three items so that the meetings will be strong, the visitations extensive, and the fellowship thorough.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>When we are in life, then the truth is secure, the meetings, visitations, and fellowship are strong, and it is time to preach the gospel. This is how the gospel is preached. When the saints are enlivened and are serving, we must spread the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom by endeavoring in the gospel. If the saints have unsaved family members, we must encourage the saints to bring their family members to salvation. The Bible says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&rdquo; (Acts 16:31). The saints should be so burdened that they would weep before the Lord until this promise is fulfilled. The saints might also fast and petition the Lord desperately so that this word may be fulfilled. After our family is saved, we need to bring our other relatives and our friends, neighbors, colleagues, and schoolmates to salvation. We must motivate the saints to spread the gospel.</p>
<p>We should have gospel activities. We can have a gospel meeting for the whole church, distribute tracts and gospel booklets to our neighbors, or post gospel banners. Sometimes we may preach the gospel in the homes of the saints. The saints should not wait on a particular person in order to preach the gospel. A brother should be free to invite family and friends to his home in order to sing hymns with them. A sister might want to give her testimony to her family and friends or to read the Bible with them. We should also ask our gospel friends to speak, and then, according to their speaking, bring them to salvation. Preaching the gospel in the homes is not a quick way to bear fruit, but those who are saved in the homes experience a thorough salvation.</p>
<p>In addition, we can sometimes combine several group meetings and preach the gospel together, or two localities can have a large gospel activity. We must actively preach the gospel.</p>
<p>This fellowship is merely an outline. Every local church should pay attention to life, the truth, the church, and the gospel. This is not doctrine. This fellowship must be our practice. I hope that the saints in every church can be involved in these four matters.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">A LIFE-SUPPLYING SERVICE</h1>
<p>This chapter is concerning how to supply life in the service of the church, particularly in the service of the elders and the deacons. There are many areas in the service of the elders and deacons that require our attention. In this chapter we will focus on a basic matter in service, which is supplying life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE BEING THE OUTFLOW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Those who serve the Lord must be clear that every service should supply life. The elders should not think that their responsibility in the church is merely to handle business affairs and manage matters. The elders should not say that as long as they manage matters and handle business affairs properly, their service is adequate. The deacons should not say that their service is complete after they finish taking care of the business affairs. The church service is to supply life, for it is a service of life. If we merely handle business affairs or manage matters but do not supply others with the life of God, our service is a failure and is vain. We should never think that only those who minister the word are the ones who supply life but that the service of the elders or deacons is merely to handle business affairs and to manage matters. Such a concept is wrong and needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>Every service, whether preaching the gospel, giving messages, managing business affairs, or visitation, that is, whether the service is spiritual or administrative, should be a means for us to supply the life that we have received. Preaching the gospel is for the supply of life. Ministering the word is for the supply of life. Visitation is for the supply of life, and serving in the church business office is for the supply of life. Even ordinary things, such as sweeping and cleaning the windows, are a means to supply life. Apparently, there are many items in the church service, but spiritually, these many items have one purpose, which is to supply life.</p>
<p>Although the saints have heard the principles concerning service, I am fellowshipping concerning this again because we need to consider our service. No matter what our service may be, we should be clear that our service is a means to supply life to others. The elders and the deacons must uphold this point.</p>
<p>Whether or not we are adequate in our service, our focus is on supplying life, not on accomplishing something.</p>
<p>The church is different from a society. The church is of life and is spiritual, but a society is like a business. In the church the point is not whether we do a good job but whether life is supplied. If the church were only for taking care of matters, not supplying life, the church would lose its nature and would be a society. The saints must uphold this point.</p>
<p>I am not saying that we can be sloppy in our service. When things are done incorrectly, the saints are not edified. We must serve in fear and trembling before the Lord lest our service be haphazard. However, we cannot be content with doing a service. We must serve in such a way that others may receive the supply of life. We need to be deeply impressed with this point and look to the Lord so that our service becomes an outlet for His life. We want to be delivered from mistakes, but the focus of such deliverance is not on doing a successful job but on the flowing out of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The life that we supply to others is in the Spirit. This means that the Spirit is the dwelling place of the life of God. In Romans 8:2 the Spirit is referred to as the &ldquo;Spirit of life.&rdquo; Since the life of God is in the Spirit, the Spirit is the Spirit of life. In addition, as children of God, we have His life in our spirit. The life of God is in the Spirit and in our spirit.</p>
<p>The life of God is not in human thoughts, views, or opinions. The life of God is in the Spirit and dwells in the regenerated human spirit. The divine life is in the two spirits, the Spirit mingled with our human spirit. Initially, the divine life was only in the Spirit, but now the divine life dwells also in our spirit. It is difficult for expositors to determine whether the spirit in Romans 8 refers specifically to the Spirit of God or to our human spirit, for the two spirits are mingled together. In chapter 8 the Spirit and the human spirit have become one spirit. Both the divine Spirit and the human spirit are similar in nature, for they are both spirit. The Spirit is mingled with our human spirit, and the life of God is located, abides, and grows in our mingled spirit. Hence, if we are to supply the saints with life, we must release our spirit, for the divine life is in our mingled spirit. If our spirit cannot be released, the divine life has no way to be released.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LIFE<br />
AND MORAL CHARACTER</h2>
<p>Let us consider what it means to supply life. Christianity speaks of being good, which involves moral character, good deeds, and good behavior. Christianity does not speak of the divine life referred to in the Word of God. The Bible says, &ldquo;Death operates in us, but life in you&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:12). This means that when the death of Christ operates in us, life operates in others. This life is not moral character or behavior; rather, it is the life of God. This is a great distinction.</p>
<p>Those who serve God should indeed have good moral character, have good behavior, and do good deeds; otherwise, they will hinder others from receiving the divine life. In order not to hinder others from receiving the supply of life, we must do good deeds and have good moral character. However, good deeds and good moral character do not necessarily mean that the life of God is expressed through us. We may be irreproachable and commendable in our service yet express merely good character, perfection, and human virtues, but these are not the life of God.</p>
<p>Few among God&rsquo;s children can distinguish between life and good behavior. If a brother supplies others with copper, they will receive copper. If he supplies them with gold, they will receive gold. If we supply the saints with life, God&rsquo;s children will have a taste for life. People cannot have a taste for something that they have not seen. Christians do not have a taste for life because the element of life is lacking in Christianity. What is expressed in Christianity is good moral character and good behavior. We need to understand that the moral character and good behavior spoken of in the Bible are none other than the life of God being expressed through man. Our service depends on our knowing what is life and what is the outflow of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD BEING TO FLOW OUT LIFE</h2>
<p>Let us consider how the life of God flows out from us. The Spirit is life, and the Spirit is God Himself (John 6:63; 4:24). Through incarnation God became a man by the name Jesus Christ and lived a perfect human life, was crucified, and resurrected. In resurrection Christ became the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is Christ, and Christ is God. Since the Spirit is God, the life of God is in the Spirit. In order to supply others with the life of God, we must be in spirit and we must fellowship with God. When we cease fellowshipping with God, we are cut off from the divine life. Fellowshipping with God must become our experience and not merely doctrinal knowledge.</p>
<p>God and the life of God are inseparable. Hence, a person who receives the life of God also receives God. We cannot say that we want the life of God but that we do not want God, because a person cannot be separated from his life. When we received God, we gained His life, but when we reject God, we cannot gain His life. Likewise, we should not expect the life of God to be expressed through us when we do not fellowship with God and do not live one with Him. Although we cannot be separated from God because we have His life, in our experience we are cut off from the flow of the divine life when we do not maintain our fellowship with God.</p>
<p>If we want the life of God to flow out of us so that we can supply others with this life, we must have unhindered fellowship with God, contacting Him not only every day but every moment. Only when we are contacting God can the life of God flow out of us.</p>
<p>We must have the proper experience of fellowship. We need to daily set aside definite times to fellowship with God. No one can fellowship with God without spending time in prayer. In particular, the saints who serve must daily allocate enough quality time to fellowship with God in prayer. The focus of such prayer is not for God to give us things or to do things for us but for us to commune with God in spirit, that is, for us to breathe in God and enjoy Him. The more time we spend fellowshipping with God, breathing Him in, and enjoying Him, the better.</p>
<p>It is best to have a time of fellowship in the morning. It is difficult for us to let the divine life flow out without having sufficient fellowship with the Lord in the morning. A person who can do such will be quite deep in the Lord. We must spend enough time in the morning to enjoy the Lord and to fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>Besides having set times to fellowship with the Lord, we should also keep ourselves in unceasing fellowship with Him. We should not let anything come between us and the Lord. Anything that comes between us and the Lord becomes a barrier. Such an item can be a thought, an intention, an emotion, a person, or a thing. Once we perceive that something has come between us and God, we must immediately reject, judge, and condemn it. Such condemning and judging will not only maintain our fellowship with God but also deepen it. Only those who have such moment-by-moment fellowship with God can supply others with the divine life. Then no matter what we do, whom we contact, or what we say, life will always flow out of us. Furthermore, those who contact us will sense God.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Another important point is the need to be broken. In order for there to be a pure flow of the life of God, we must be broken. Therefore, when we consider supplying others with the divine life, we must pay attention to our being broken. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; The statement <em>I am crucified...and it is no longer I</em> refers to the experience of being broken. Only those who are broken are crucified with Christ and can say, &ldquo;It is no longer I.&rdquo; The statement <em>but it is Christ who lives in me</em> refers to the flowing out of the divine life. Christ being expressed through us is life flowing out of us.</p>
<p>The operation of death within us, spoken of in 2 Corinthians 4:12, is the killing. The operation of death is our being broken. The more we are broken, the more the life of God will flow out of us.</p>
<p>A brother who is broken can supply life. We may understand this doctrinally, but we still need to put it into practice. The Spirit of life abides in our spirit. However, besides our human spirit, we also have a soul and a body. Our soul and body encase our spirit. Therefore, in order for life to be released from our spirit, our soul and body must be dealt with and broken. The body does not pose much of a problem, but our soul poses a great problem. The things of the soul, which is composed of our mind, emotion, and will, are difficult to deal with. The soul surrounds and encases the spirit. Hence, our soul must be dealt with and broken in order for our spirit to be released. Otherwise, there cannot be a pure flow of the divine life.</p>
<p>When we say that the soul needs to be dealt with and broken, we do not mean that a person no longer uses his mind, expresses his emotions, or exercises his will. Our mind, emotion, and will still function, but they have been dealt with, subdued, and made submissive to our spirit. In other words, they have been broken. A person who cannot release his spirit is dominated by his mind, emotion, and will. A person who can release his spirit has subdued his mind, emotion, and will. The three parts of his soul are under the ruling of his spirit and let his spirit dominate.</p>
<p>When some brothers encounter something, their mind is the first to react, not their spirit. With some sisters their emotion is the first to react, not their spirit. With some saints their will is the first to react, not their spirit. The part that reacts first is the part that dominates our being. When we let our spirit respond first, the mind is subdued. When our mind responds first, our spirit is pushed back. Our mind represents the natural man; it does not possess the life of God. When our spirit is released, our mind is dealt with, broken, and held under the ruling of our spirit. Then the divine life in our spirit can be released.</p>
<p>When we hear that a brother has encountered a difficult situation, our emotion should not be the first to respond. The emotions also represent the natural man. Even if we are rough persons, we must deal with the self and let our spirit touch the matter. We must be fearful every time we encounter something. We dare not use our mind, emotion, or will; rather, we must put them under our spirit so that our spirit can be released.</p>
<p>It is difficult to explain the way to release the spirit. When we only think of something, we are using our mind. When some sisters hear a sad matter, their emotions runs wild like an unbridled horse. If they want life to flow out, they must suppress their wild emotions, and they must use their spirit to sense the situation. It is difficult for a brother with a strong will to change what he has decided. When such a brother expresses his strong will, he does not represent God. When we encounter situations with our spirit, life will flow out of us.</p>
<p>Some people live in the mind, others have a strong will, and there are those who are full of emotion. If we want to know the kind of person that we are, we should check what part of our being is the first to respond when we encounter something. If our mind responds first, we live in the mind. If our emotion responds first, we are emotional persons. If our will responds first, we are men of will. When a face hits a wall, the nose gets hit first because it is the foremost part of a face. Similarly, if a brother lives in his mind, those who contact him will touch his mind, his strongest part. If a brother has a very strong will, others will touch his will, his strongest part. If a sister is an emotional person, others will touch her emotions, her strongest part. Whether or not we are broken can be determined by how we respond to things.</p>
<p>In order for the Lord&rsquo;s life to be released from within us, we must learn to fellowship with the Lord, be subdued in our soul, and let our spirit dominate and rule over every matter. Whether we are elders or deacons or are involved in visitation or preaching the gospel, we must learn to use our spirit and to subdue our mind, emotion, and will so that we touch things with our spirit. Then the Lord&rsquo;s life will be able to flow out. Our supplying others with life does not depend on our doing things properly but on our exercising our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">DANGERS TO AVOID IN THE SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In this chapter and the next chapter, we will fellowship concerning the dangers we may encounter in our testimony, our service, and our meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGINAL CONDITION AND<br />
THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The church is a living organism, not a dead organization. In the New Testament, especially in the Acts of the Apostles, the church was a living organism. At that time the believers took the ascended Christ as their Head and were under His authority. They were ruled and led by the Spirit. They lived, moved, and worked in and by the Spirit. The human will, the letter, and regulations are not expressed in Acts, nor is there a system or an organization. This is the proper condition that God desires the church to have on the earth. The church is the living Body of Christ, the Son of God. All the believers in the Body of Christ are joined mutually to one another by the divine life and by the Spirit; hence, there is nothing of the human will, of the letter, or of regulation. This is the normal condition of the church.</p>
<p>The church did not remain in its proper condition for long. Both the Bible and church history reveal that the spiritual and heavenly condition of the church did not last very long. The church fell gradually into regulations, became an organization, and lost the experience of the divine life, its spiritual nature, and its heavenly position. When the Roman Catholic Church was formed, the spiritual and heavenly things and the divine life were lost. Later, Martin Luther rose up to reform the church. Even after the many reformations in church history, Christianity is still a system and an organization with regulations. Furthermore, the many worldly things that were brought into the church caused the church to lose her function as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The church lost her function because she lost her nature, position, and content. The nature of the church should be spiritual, her position should be heavenly, and her content should be the divine life. Christianity is an organization instead of being spiritual, it is of the earth instead of being heavenly, and it is human instead of being divine. As a result, the church has lost her function as the Body and cannot supply the life of Christ to people, express Christ on earth, or rule on the earth for God. Although there are believers in Christianity who proclaim the pure gospel and spread the truths of the Bible, the general condition of Christianity is organizational, worldly, and human.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE AND POSITION</h2>
<p>If our intention is to criticize others, we have failed. However, it is necessary to speak these things so that we may be enlightened to know the present condition of the church. If we intend to serve the Lord in this age, we must have a vision of the Body of Christ, and we must be clear about the situation of Christianity. Without a vision of the Body of Christ and an understanding of the situation in Christianity, our service will lack life and light with which to supply others; in other words, we will grope in the dark. If we want God to flow through us, we must see the church and understand the present condition of Christianity. Then He will guide us concerning the way that we should take.</p>
<p>What we practice in the meetings must be according to our vision of the Body of Christ and the present situation in Christianity. We do not intend to become another sect or another denomination. We must understand that the church is heavenly and spiritual. We are not a denomination, and we are not an earthly or human organization.</p>
<p>Other believers may call us a denomination or a sect, but we should be clear that we are neither a denomination nor a sect. We do not intend to establish denominations. That would be degradation.</p>
<p>We do not want an organization, a system, regulations, or anything worldly. We want to live in the life of God and to be ruled by the Spirit in order that we may be God&rsquo;s testimony on this earth in every locality. Apart from this desire, we are nothing. We do not have a system, and by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we want to take this way and be His testimony. We are a group of believers who walk together and testify for God. If others are not willing to take this way, we should not criticize or judge them, nor should we discriminate against them. Although we have mutual fellowship with believers who have seen the light that we have seen, this is not a matter of intimacy. And although it is difficult for us to have mutual fellowship with believers who have not seen the light that we have received, this is not a matter of discrimination. We can humbly receive spiritual help from all God&rsquo;s children, for it is a supply from the Head of the Body. When we are received by other believers, we should help them, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, according to His leading. This should be not only our view but also our practice.</p>
<p>Many believers criticize us, saying that we are closed. This is the main accusation overseas. Some people in Christianity say that I exert too much control and that I am a closed person. Some brothers have asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, why do you not speak to other believers, and why do you not invite other believers to speak to us? Does this not mean that you are closed?&rdquo; We need to ask ourselves whether we are indeed closed and to ask what our reasons are for not inviting other believers. When other believers ask me the first question, I sometimes say, &ldquo;I would go and speak to other believers, but I have not been invited. Many are concerned that I would steal their sheep. If they would open the door for me to speak, I would speak from morning to evening. Who is being closed?&rdquo; As to why we do not invite the others to speak, let me ask, &ldquo;What will they speak about?&rdquo; If their content indeed will feed the flock, let them speak. I say this from the bottom of my heart; we are always willing to walk together with God&rsquo;s children. If we do not walk together, it is because we have been forced into this situation and have no alternative.</p><h2 class="head1">SERVING GOD WITH A PURE CONSCIENCE</h2>
<p>Our responsibility is to serve God with a pure conscience. When the church became desolate, the apostle Paul spoke concerning the conscience in his Epistles to Timothy (1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 3:9; 4:2; 2 Tim. 1:3). The defense of the truth cannot be our only responsibility when the church is desolate. In fact, our first responsibility must be to bear a good conscience before God. Suppose a brother says, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your way of serving God is wrong.&rdquo; I would humbly say to him, &ldquo;Brother, perhaps I am wrong, but my conscience is pure. Therefore, please give me some freedom. If you think that what you are doing is acceptable to God, you should bear that responsibility in your conscience before Him. That is not my responsibility. I would be very happy if you could see the light that God has shown me and walk according to it, but you are taking a different way. I dare not condemn you, because it is your responsibility before God.&rdquo; This should be our attitude.</p>
<p>The church fell into desolation and chaos while the apostles were still alive, but the apostles did not do a work of conformity. I do not believe that the apostles did such a work. Paul did not do a work of conformity. Paul instead told Timothy to maintain a good conscience and to serve God with a good conscience.</p>
<p>I once had fellowship with several brothers who asked, &ldquo;Is only your way the right way?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brothers, I did not say that, nor is that my attitude. We are each responsible to maintain a pure conscience before God. We should not interfere in others&rsquo; affairs. If you think that my way is wrong and that yours is right, my conscience is still pure. Please give me the freedom to serve God according to the light that I have received. If after two years I see that my way is wrong but your way is right, I will follow your way. My conscience is clear. In the same principle, even though you think that your way is right, in two years the Lord may show you that my way is right. Therefore, I should give you the freedom to serve God. I will never criticize you or interfere in what you are doing.&rdquo; After that day there was nothing left to dispute.</p>
<p>All of us here have this feeling before the Lord. Perhaps one day the Lord will lead me to do things in a different way, and then we will learn this lesson: there is no need to criticize or judge anyone. Rather, our responsibility is to maintain a pure conscience before God. The way that others are taking is their responsibility.</p>
<p>Just as the apostles did not dispute with others, we should not dispute over who is right or who is wrong. A brother should not be foolish and say that only his way is right. His responsibility is to maintain a pure conscience before God. Whether or not God will touch his conscience does not depend on a third party. Hence, on the one hand, we should give one another the freedom to serve. On the other hand, we must be blameless in our conscience.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters is whether we are intentionally trying to be different from others and whether we are disputing with them based on differing opinions because we have not maintained a pure conscience before God. We cannot judge one another in these matters. Every brother is responsible to God. This is our way and our position. We cannot follow or partake of Roman Catholicism, and we cannot follow or partake of Christianity, even if others say that we are closed. We need to be humble and maintain a pure conscience in order to please God in this time of degradation. We should fellowship and serve together with all God&rsquo;s children in every matter as long as our conscience is not offended. We will not criticize others, and we hope that others will not criticize us. The time for judgment is when the Lord comes (1 Cor. 4:5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST DANGER&mdash;<br />
BECOMING A SYSTEM AND AN ORGANIZATION</h2>
<p>We must guard against falling into a system or becoming an organization. Concerning this, we must be clear that we have a group of workers and that we have a work. The work exists wherever there are workers. this is inevitable. We also have the churches with meetings in different localities for mutual fellowship. The workers, the work, the churches, and the mutual fellowship among churches are good and necessary, but we may make this into a system.</p>
<p>The workers and the work should help and supply the church, the church should support and supply the work, and the local churches should have mutual fellowship. Among the workers there should be spiritual order, spiritual authority. The workers who are more mature have a little authority, and the younger workers, who are less experienced, should learn to submit. This kind of learning should not be only among the workers; the churches in the different localities should also learn lessons on submission. Some churches are more experienced, and others are weaker. The weaker local churches need the help of the more experienced churches. All these experiences are necessary, but there is a danger that they can become a system, making us an organization.</p>
<p>The workers, the work, and the churches may be spiritual in the beginning, but they can gradually become a system. The workers, the work, and the churches may initially be of life but gradually become an organization. The relationship between the workers, the work, and the churches may be spiritual, but it can gradually fall into a system. The fellowship between the different localities may be spiritual and of life, but it can gradually fall into an organized system. This danger applies even to a local church. The submitting of the younger saints to the more experienced ones may be of life, and the arrangements in the church service may be spiritual and of life, but they can deviate from life and deteriorate.</p>
<p>If we fall into a system and become an organization, we will lose the spirit and the element of life, and we will be left with arrangements and positions; that is, we will have only an empty shell without life. We face this danger in every locality. The fellowship from some of the brothers concerning the lack of spiritual supply in certain localities indicates the danger of becoming an organization.</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel is an example. If a church does not make arrangements, the brothers and sisters will not preach the gospel. The saints wait until the elders decide when to preach the gospel, to distribute gospel tracts, and to visit the weaker saints. Then the elders may assign some saints to lead the singing, some to serve as ushers, and some to speak with the new ones. Thus, the saints function only when they are assigned; hence, there is a gospel-preaching show. It is true that some will get saved, but we must know that this situation portrays an organization.</p>
<p>There is a difference between a corpse and a body. A corpse is a body without life. We recognize that it is not possible to be without arrangements in the spiritual service, but the arrangements must have the Spirit and life. If we have arrangements but not the Spirit and life, we have fallen into a system and become an organization.</p>
<p>When someone is baptized, the elders assign him to the group meeting that is closest to his residence. The elders also arrange for some saints to be responsible for the group meetings. The elders arrange for a group to have a love feast and fellowship. The responsible saints might not shepherd the brothers and sisters in the group, but because the responsible ones have been assigned, they must prepare the group for a love feast. This situation is the activity of a corpse that does not have life or the spirit. This shows that we have become an organization with a system.</p>
<p>Arrangements are necessary, but the arrangements must be in life. Arrangements must meet the needs of the divine life in the saints. Arrangements that lack the spiritual element of the divine life are a system.</p>
<p>Likewise, it is good for the churches to copy, imitate, and follow each other. The Bible speaks of this in 1 Thessalonians 1:6-7. The positive situation in a local church should be imitated by other local churches. This is right and pleasing to the Lord. However, we must guard against imitating, copying, and following that become a system. Suppose the saints in a locality want to preach the gospel. They should first seek the Lord in prayer before they decide to copy another locality.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei is blessed and has some situations that are pleasing to the Lord. It would be good for the various churches to imitate the church in Taipei. But we must ask ourselves whether we touch God when we imitate and whether our imitating is in the Spirit. If we imitate without touching the Lord in prayer, we may criticize churches that are different from Taipei and say that they are independent. There are some saints with this attitude. They justify the churches that copy the methods used in Taipei and condemn the other churches. This is an attitude that leads to organization.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the serving ones in a locality should determine to not copy Taipei. If the sisters in Taipei cover their heads with black head coverings, to use a blue head covering does not mean that a sister is spiritual and is not in a system. This is the flesh. The desire to be different from others is the flesh. Outward behavior does not determine whether something is a system or an organization. We must touch the inward feeling.</p>
<p>The full-time serving ones in the localities have practical needs for their living. Under the Lord&rsquo;s leading, they are supplied by the churches and by the ministry. This arrangement is spiritual and of life. We must guard against this arrangement becoming a system, in which the care of the full-time serving ones becomes solely the responsibility of either the ministry or the church. Under normal conditions this should be a living matter. The serving ones should live before the Lord and look to Him for their needs. The saints, the churches, and the ministry should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to supply the serving ones. Everyone should live according to the Spirit and be in life. Then this matter will not become a system.</p>
<p>The first danger we must guard against is having a system and becoming an organization. There should be elders and deacons in the local churches, and services should be orderly and free of chaos. However, we must guard against the danger of losing the presence of the Spirit and the vitality of life, that is, of falling into a system and becoming an organization. The saints can preach the gospel and visit the weaker ones without the arrangement of the elders. When every service depends upon an arrangement made by the elders, we have become an organization.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is divine order among us. We have elders and deacons, there is coordination in the services, and we submit to authority. These are good and necessary. On the other hand, an elder must not claim the position of an elder, a deacon must not claim the position of a deacon, and the saints should not have the concept that elders and deacons are treated in a certain way but that ordinary brothers and sisters are treated in another way. Such a concept shows that we have fallen into a system and are an organization.</p>
<p>When God&rsquo;s children serve together, they must learn spiritual lessons, submit to spiritual authority, and coordinate. The coordination should supply, nurture, and strengthen. Otherwise, the practices that are of life and the spirit will become a system.</p>
<p>Whether or not they are a co-worker, an elder, a deacon, or a responsible one in a group meeting and regardless of their age, every brother and sister is responsible to guard against becoming an organization. We all should learn to accept the breaking of the cross and the discipline of the Spirit and to know our position, the order in God&rsquo;s house, and the authority established by God. We must also learn to live in spirit and in fellowship and to be fresh, vital, and strengthened in our services. Our submission to authority should be of the Spirit and full of the anointing. If this is our situation, we are on the right track. We will be delivered from the danger of a system. We must not condemn others in these matters. We should apply them to ourselves so that we focus on the Spirit and life and guard against systems and organization.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECOND DANGER&mdash;<br />
FULL-TIME SERVICE TURNING INTO EMPLOYMENT</h2>
<p>The second danger we must guard against concerns the serving ones. We must not consider our full-time service to the Lord to be a form of employment. A serving one might have such a concept. The saints may also have the concept that there are different forms of employment&mdash;some people are teachers, some are doctors, and some are full-time serving ones. This erroneous concept turns serving the Lord into a form of employment, and it implies that only those serving full time are serving the Lord but that the working saints are not serving the Lord. Serving the Lord is not a career or a profession. Every believer should serve the Lord. Those who serve the Lord full time should not regard serving the Lord as employment.</p>
<p>Over the years many saints have given up their studies and careers in order to serve the Lord full time. As a result, there is a tendency to view this service as employment. Such a degraded concept may cause us to lose the brightness of our testimony that we have received from the Lord.</p>
<p>Such a degraded concept has two issues. First, the saints will regard serving the Lord as a means of livelihood. Second, those who serve the Lord will lose the spiritual burden and will depend on the arrangements made by the work.</p>
<p>A teacher must accept the classes assigned to him. He must teach the students when it is class time, and when class is over, he is free. On the weekend he can do as he wishes, but he must return to teach his class on Monday. This is what it means to be employed. If in spiritual matters concerning the church and the work, a serving one merely accepts what is arranged, his service is a form of employment. A serving one should not only accept responsibilities but must also have a burden for the saints and a burden to save souls.</p>
<p>First Kings 3:16-28 is an example. Two women were quarreling over who was the mother of a child. Solomon was truly wise; he said, &ldquo;Divide the live child between the two, and give half to one and half to the other.&rdquo; The real mother immediately said, &ldquo;Give the live child to her, and do not by any means kill him!&rdquo; Solomon then was clear that she was the real mother. The other woman said, &ldquo;He shall neither be mine nor yours; divide him.&rdquo; This made it clear that she was not the mother.</p>
<p>From the tone of many of the full-time serving saints, we can tell that their &ldquo;motherhood&rdquo; has become a form of employment. They are &ldquo;false&rdquo; mothers. They are not burdened to preach the gospel, they are not burdened for the souls of men, and they have no feelings for the church or for the saints. These serving ones have a job. Although this may not have been their intention, they have fallen into such a state.</p>
<p>There are two ways by which we may know whether our service has become a job. If our service is merely a way to make a living, it has become a job; and if we do not have a burden, our service has become a job. As serving ones, we should care for our burden and forget our livelihood. This is the way to maintain our position of being called. We have been called to serve God. We should be burdened for the Lord&rsquo;s work, the church, the saints, the souls of men, and the Lord&rsquo;s commission. We are not consumed by our living; rather, we have placed that in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. This is the attitude of a serving one. We must guard against the danger of our service becoming a form of employment.</p>
<p>The churches and the saints also face the danger of regarding the full-time serving ones as employees. A brother once said, &ldquo;If the full-time serving ones are not willing to serve, who will serve?&rdquo; These words seem to say, &ldquo;We hired the serving ones to do this. If they will not do it, who will?&rdquo; Even though this was not said, the words bear such a flavor. The brothers and sisters who serve the Lord full time should not have such a wrong concept, and also the brothers and sisters who do not serve full time should not have such a wrong concept. Such a concept should not exist among us. The serving ones should have the desire to serve the Lord, to care for the saints, and to save souls. Among us there is no distinction between those who are serving and those who are not serving. If there is a distinction, our service has become a form of employment, and we have fallen into degradation. This is a danger that we must all guard against and reject.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">DANGERS TO AVOID IN THE SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we mentioned two dangers that we must guard against in our service. In this chapter we will consider three more dangers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THIRD DANGER&mdash;DOCTRINES</h2>
<p>In our Christian journey we must guard against doctrines. When we speak of doctrines, we are referring to the truths in the Bible becoming dead letter and losing the Spirit and life. Through His seekers throughout the ages, God has gradually unlocked the truths in the Bible, thereby giving His children new light. For example, Martin Luther and others saw the truth of justification by faith during the Reformation. Since then a considerable number of believers have seen more truths, such as sanctification by faith, living by faith, the meaning of baptism, the practice of the church, consecration, the indwelling of Christ, and co-crucifixion. God has given these truths to His church. The danger, however, is that we may receive these truths as doctrines. Then they lose the power of the Spirit and become dead letter, dead knowledge.</p>
<p>We humbly acknowledge that over the years God has given us new light that needs to be released to all God&rsquo;s children. But there is a danger that the light we have received will gradually become doctrine, dead letter, and empty knowledge; that is, it will lose the divine life and the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>God has given us much light in our trainings. We hope that every trainee will continue to review the lessons in order to receive the benefit. Nonetheless, there is still a danger that dead knowledge and doctrines will be produced.</p>
<p>The benefit of the trainings is not so much that we receive revelation but that we receive wisdom. Ephesians 1:17 mentions &ldquo;a spirit of wisdom and revelation.&rdquo; We first receive wisdom and then revelation. Wisdom prepares us to receive revelation. The trainings merely prepare us with wisdom. There is still a need for us to obtain revelation. It is easy to regard the material and the light we received in the trainings as complete. This prevents us from receiving revelation. No one can help us with respect to revelation. In order to receive revelation, we must live in spirit, let God touch us, be willing to pay the price, accept His breaking, and learn spiritual lessons. This does not mean that we need to memorize the training lessons in order to receive spiritual revelation. Spiritual revelation cannot be found in the training lessons. Spiritual revelation depends on our meeting God, being touched by Him, being broken, paying the price, learning the lessons, and spending time in His presence. If we are such persons, we will receive revelation. Hence, revelation does not depend entirely on the trainings.</p>
<p>We publish spiritual books and hold trainings out of burden. However, we feel that there is still a lack, because some saints depend solely on the publications for their spiritual life. Some brothers who give messages depend only on the material in the books and their notes from the trainings, but they have little experience that is based on contacting God. The brothers who give messages must be persons who contact God so that they have a burden in their spirit. In order to receive revelation, they need to pay the price and spend time to learn lessons. Then they can use the help from the ministry books for utterance to enrich their speaking. The ministry books and training notes are helpful and beneficial to a brother who has a burden but does not sufficiently understand a point.</p>
<p>A brother might read a spiritual book before he contacts the Lord. Then the Spirit can give him a seeking heart or enlighten his understanding so that he receives revelation and has a burden for a message. It is also possible to use the material in a book to give a message that is living, not dead. We fear that some brothers take the written material and speak according to what is printed, but they lack the spiritual supply. I believe that the saints understand this problem.</p>
<p>The brothers who give messages are not the only ones with such a problem. Many of the saints have the same problem. It is easy for them to take our publications as doctrine. The truth then becomes dead letter. Such saints do not contact or seek the Lord when they read the publications. It is as if they read the books in order to know how to speak or what to do in a certain situation.</p>
<p>It is even easy to be influenced when reading the Bible. For example, while a brother is reading Ephesians 2, he might remember that there was a message in the training concerning the significance of this chapter and look for his notes. A sister who is reading Matthew 25 might remember an explanation in Watchman Nee&rsquo;s <em>Study on Matthew.</em> These saints have been distracted from reading the Bible by ministry publications. This danger causes us to turn spiritual things into dead letter, hinders us from contacting God directly, and causes the Spirit to lose ground within us.</p>
<p>Many years ago in northern China I met a German brother who approved of J. N. Darby. One day as we were talking, I mentioned a book written by Darby. His response seemed to say, &ldquo;Since that book was written by Darby, it is the best, and there cannot be anything better. You cannot say anything that compares to what Darby has said. Everything that God wants to say to the church is in his writing.&rdquo; According to that brother, anything that Darby did not say must be incorrect and even heretical.</p>
<p>I am deeply concerned that such an attitude might also be in us. We do not despise the speaking of prophets, and we should receive all that God has spoken through His servants. However, if it were merely a matter of receiving doctrine, what God has spoken through His servants would be dead, and even the Bible would be dead. Dead doctrines are a snare and a danger that we face. We must guard against them.</p>
<p>We should read the Bible, have a living contact with the Lord, and receive the light that God has given through His servants. We must not be so foolish as to believe that we understand and know more than other believers. We must not be so foolish as to believe that we do not need help from other believers or that we know everything. This is a very foolish attitude. At the same time, however, we must not think that we can receive all that we need from others&rsquo; books or even our books. We should not say that we have a book for sanctification, a book for justification, and yet another for the faith. We must not have such an attitude.</p>
<p>When I was a young believer, I thought that the Bible was difficult to understand. Therefore, I bought commentaries on each book in the Old Testament and in the New Testament so that I could become a Bible authority. If there was anything I did not understand in the Bible, I would read about it in the commentaries. However, experience has proven that although we need outward help in order to understand God&rsquo;s Word, such help is not sufficient. The true way to understand God&rsquo;s Word is to contact Him, touch His feeling, and let Him touch us.</p>
<p>A person whose true condition has not been touched by the Lord cannot understand the truth. We must let the Lord touch our being, that is, touch our background, our standing, our walk, our position, our reputation, our tendencies, our preferences, and our future. Our ability to know His Word depends on how much He has worked in us. It is futile to read the Bible merely with the mind. As the Lord works in us, we will receive light from the portions that we have read and memorized. Many saints have had this experience.</p>
<p>We can apply the same principle to reading the ministry books. A brother may be quite familiar with the books, having read them thoroughly, but whether he truly understands them and can apply them effectively and in a way that is full of life depends on his contact with the Lord. A brother who does not let the Lord work in him might preach proficiently and speak fluently, but his speaking is like sounding brass or a clanging cymbal, and his words are dead, without life and the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is true that there is an indispensable need for the publications and the trainings. In his old age the apostle Paul wrote to Timothy, &ldquo;The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:13). Paul was always reading. It is not possible to arrive at a point in our Christian life when we do not need to read the Bible or the ministry books, or a point when we do not need to listen to spiritual messages from other believers. A believer who reaches such a point is proud and foolish. We should always humble ourselves in order to be taught and to receive help from others. However, we must maintain our contact with the Lord in His presence. We must let the Lord touch our feelings. The truths that we receive from others should become our revelation. Otherwise, we will be left with dead knowledge. Dead knowledge does not have the vitality of life or the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Not only should the saints have such an attitude, the church should also have such an attitude. We should not be so proud that we do not accept anything from others, nor should we mechanically accept light in the Word and the ministry as doctrine. We need to be balanced. May the Lord have mercy on us. If the Lord permits, we will publish more ministry books. But may He deliver us from falling into doctrines. We must learn to live in His presence and to contact Him and to let Him touch us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOURTH DANGER&mdash;RESTRICTING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must guard against restricting the Spirit. Although we are learning many spiritual lessons, such as submitting to authority, keeping the order in the work, and not being independent, there is still the danger that we may restrict the Spirit. The work of the Spirit is often contrary to our expectations. He does not abide by the boundaries that we define. We often want the Spirit to abide by our rules, but He does not abide by our rules. The Spirit often makes exceptions to our ways.</p>
<p>There are examples in the Old Testament. Samuel was not a descendant of Aaron and should not have been a priest. The word of God, however, came not to Eli the priest but to Samuel (1 Sam. 3). The Spirit left the priestly circle to do something new. Samuel did not have any experience, and the elderly Eli did not understand. Samuel heard God call him but did not understand, so he ran to Eli and said, &ldquo;Here I am, for you called me,&rdquo; but Eli said to him, &ldquo;I did not call. Go back and lie down&rdquo; (v. 5). When God called Samuel a second time, Samuel went to Eli again, and again Eli told Samuel to go back and lie down (v. 6). It was not until the third time that Eli perceived it was Jehovah who was calling Samuel (v. 8). Although Eli was old, he feared God and did not restrict His work, because he told Samuel to then say, &ldquo;Speak, O Jehovah; for Your servant is listening&rdquo; (v. 9).</p>
<p>David is another example. God rejected Saul from being king over Israel and found a young man, David, to replace Saul (16:1-13). Saul and David&rsquo;s older brothers despised the young David and did not think that he was useful. However, God does not work according to our expectations.</p>
<p>God does not raise up useful persons only among elders, deacons, or co-workers. He can make exceptions. God often does things in secret; He does a hidden work in man&rsquo;s heart. The co-workers and the responsible ones should not be so proud as to say, &ldquo;God does not have anyone whom He can use besides us co-workers and responsible ones.&rdquo; Such a dangerous attitude is a snare.</p>
<p>Just as the wind blows where it wills, so also is the Holy Spirit. For the past two thousand years no one has been able to confine the Spirit. When we are comfortable and think that we know everything, the Holy Spirit may raise up someone else. The Spirit does not like pride or display and is not subject to our control. He needs us to be subject to His authority; we cannot restrict Him.</p>
<p>The Spirit is not subject to regulations. Peter, John, and James in the early church did not understand this matter. Although they considered themselves to be ministers in the New Testament age, God unexpectedly chose someone outside their circle. The Spirit went to Saul of Tarsus, who opposed the Lord and was persecuting the church. The Lord said to Saul, &ldquo;It is hard for you to kick against the goads&rdquo; (Acts 26:14). The Lord was determined to use Saul. A goad is a sharp-pointed stick on a plow for subduing the cattle yoked to the plow. If the cattle are stubborn or not submissive, they are prodded with the goad. Many times a cow kicks at the plow and hits the sharp-pointed stick. The Lord said, &ldquo;It is hard for you to kick against the goads,&rdquo; meaning, &ldquo;It is better to submit conscientiously.&rdquo; The Spirit not only reached a person who was rebellious but also captured him.</p>
<p>After his salvation Saul was brought by the Spirit to Jerusalem. The disciples in Jerusalem feared him; they did not believe that he was a disciple (9:26). The disciples could not believe that the Spirit would raise up such a person as Saul. If I were Peter or James, I would have said, &ldquo;Lord, I am really puzzled. Why did You raise up this man from among our persecutors?&rdquo; The Lord would have said, &ldquo;No doubt you are puzzled, for My ways are higher than your ways. Do not think that you can limit Me to your small circle. I will jump out whenever you try to restrict Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our attitude should be that everything is in the hands of the Spirit, not in our hands. When we define the way that God should work, He will often leave our restrictions and go to someone else. It does not matter whether that person was opposing God and loving the world. Hence, to define a boundary for the Spirit is to restrict His work. If we restrict the Spirit, He may react and set us aside. As a result, we will lose the flow of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Spiritual matters are not in our hands. We must learn to be faithful but not restrict the Spirit. The Lord must have a free way, and we must not be loose. We must learn the lessons on life and know the flesh. We do not have the freedom to do what we think is right. We must not be persons who live according to the flesh. In relation to the work of the Spirit, David and Saul of Tarsus did not live according to the flesh, and they were not presumptuous, unruly, or rebellious. Saul of Tarsus persecuted the believers, but he was chosen by God. This seems to be contradictory.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there should not be any control among us. Spiritual control restricts the work of the Spirit. On the other hand, we should not be presumptuous. The absence of control does not mean that we may be loose and express our opinions freely. This is the flesh. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, may we be those who know the Spirit and do not restrict Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FIFTH DANGER&mdash;BLESSINGS BECOMING SNARES</h2>
<p>We have been blessed by the Lord in the years past, and we are still being blessed. We must beware lest we depend on the blessings. Once we depend on the blessings, they will become a snare and a danger to us. Many things are encompassed in the blessings. For example, when a locality begins to meet, there may be only three or five saints. Under such difficult circumstances the responsible ones might pray desperately and have much fellowship with the Lord. As a result, the locality might be blessed; that is, the number of saints might increase, and there is an increase in material offerings. The responsible ones might depend on such blessings. With the coming of these blessings, the responsible ones might pray less, have fewer dealings with God, and, as a result, have less fellowship with Him; that is, they depend less on God. This is the beginning of degradation, and the church has fallen into a snare. This can happen in a local church and also in the work of the Lord.</p>
<p>Some saints say that the work in Taiwan is easier now than it was when we began the Lord&rsquo;s testimony six to seven years ago. At that time, there were very few serving ones, and the situation in every locality was difficult. As a result, the serving ones were desperate. Now it is as if we have support that we can depend on. With over fifty localities in the province, we can bear the problems corporately; hence, the burden is not too heavy. On the one hand, it is good to bear the burden corporately, but on the other hand, this has become a snare that may cause us to lose our heart toward God and our willingness to be dealt with. Consequently, although the church is blessed, it may lose God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s presence is not a trivial matter. The value of our service and our way depends on His presence. Once we lose God&rsquo;s presence, we are finished. Our way and the ground can become a shell without the true content. Without the content, we lose the reality of the Body of Christ. This means that we lose both the fullness of Christ and the expression of Christ. This is one of the main factors of the degradation of the church.</p>
<p>We must be fearful and humble in spirit so that we do not depend solely upon God&rsquo;s blessings. We should fear the blessings more than anything else. We should not celebrate because of the blessings that God has given us. We must realize that blessings often become idols, which cause us to lose God&rsquo;s presence; that is, they can become a wall between us and God. It is possible to have God&rsquo;s blessing yet be without His presence.</p>
<p>We must look to the Lord for His mercy so that we may guard against the dangers and deal with them. There are still other dangers, such as staleness and oldness. We need to comprehend the principle of these dangers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING THE DANGERS</h2>
<p>The way to avoid the five dangers is to not let anything or anyone become a barrier between us and God. The responsible ones in the churches and the workers must learn to contact God in all things. No matter how good or spiritual something may be, we should not let it come into our relationship with God. We should learn to live always in His presence and not let anything cause Him to hide His face from us. We must not have an &ldquo;Isaac&rdquo; who keeps us from loving God. Regardless of what blessings or gifts God gives us, we must place them on the altar. The ministry books that benefit us must be placed on the altar, and the blessings that the church receives must be placed on the altar. We need to be dealt with by God and not remain in the blessings. The work may spread and raise up more churches, but the work and the issue need to be put on the altar; they must not come between us and God. Anything that becomes a wall between us and God should be demolished. The way to avoid any danger is to contact God, live in the light of His face, and touch His presence.</p>
<p>When we live before God, every institution, system, and organization will lose its position. Institutions, systems, and organizations cannot remain in the light of His face. When we touch the light of His face, doctrines disappear, and systems and organizations cease to exist.</p>
<p>As those who have been called by the Lord and led to serve Him, if we lose our fellowship with Him and do not live in His presence, our service will become a form of employment. We must learn to live in the light of His face, to touch His presence, to fellowship with Him continually, and to let Him touch our problems and our intentions. Then we will be burdened to accept the commission of the Holy Spirit, and our service will be saved from the danger of becoming an employment. If we covet God&rsquo;s blessing and remain in it, there will be snares everywhere in our path. The only way to avoid the dangers is to be before the Lord and let Him have authority over all things.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may learn to live before His face continually and let the Spirit have His rightful place among us. Then the dangers will disappear. Otherwise, the very things that we condemn today will transpire among us in the future. I hope that the saints in every locality will pray concerning this fellowship and ask the Lord to deliver us from the many dangers in our path and from losing His presence.</p></body></html>
