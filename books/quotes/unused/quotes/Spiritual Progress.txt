According to the record of the Bible and the experience of the saints, spiritual progress is the increase of the element of God in us
If the element of God in us becomes two or three hundred units, it means that we have made some spiritual progress
As long as there is one thing, one event, or one person that takes possession of you, you have fallen from the presence of God
From the day we were saved until now, how many things, events, and people are still occupying us and depriving God of His rightful place?
A brother once said that man's heart is like sticky gum; it sticks to anything that comes across its way, whether it is clothing or a table
No matter what our heart is attached to, as long as there is one thing usurping God's place in us, we have fallen
As long as we are occupied by something other than God, and as long as we do not yield the proper place to God, we are fallen
You may fail to love God because your son is too lovable, and you may not love God because your son is not lovable
We have mentioned the positive aspect of spiritual progress, which is the increase of the element of God in us
Spiritual progress on the negative side is the shedding of certain things from us, that is, from our inner being
We must not think that we can make progress by simply attending a meeting, hearing a message, or understanding a message
Brothers and sisters, we must not only be clean but also pure; we should not be occupied by anything other than God
Spiritual progress on the positive side means the increase of the element of God and on the negative side it means the decrease of ourselves
After seven days, he may see that his impatience should not have any place in him, and he will decrease some more
The Lord said to the disciples, 'Everyone of you who does not forsake all his own possessions cannot be My disciple'
Consequently, the work of the cross can only be executed by the Holy Spirit in us, and only then will things drop off
Now the execution of this stripping work by the Holy Spirit is based on the degree to which our heart is turned towards God
