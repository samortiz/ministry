   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Dead to the Law</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a fact that we are no longer in Adam but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we must realize that our history is very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our history, in addition to the cross of Christ and the death and resurrection of Christ, there is the history of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moses was the law-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through him the law of God was given John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Adam gave us sin and death, and Christ gives us righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But between Adam and Christ, there was another man named Moses, through whom the law was given.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The law is a complication.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the law of God is very good, we need to forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have the boldness to tell you to forget about the law of God because according to God s Word it has nothing to do with us and is in fact foreign to us as believers Rom 6:6; 7:4; Gal 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have been brought out of Adam and are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Anything that is outside of Christ we should not try to touch.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the law is something that is outside of Christ, we should not try to touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Forgetting about the law, however, is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact of the matter is that although we may try to forget about it, we simply cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps we were able to forget about it yesterday, but today someone may come to us and remind us that according to the law we must love our neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a teaching causes us to remember the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We ourselves often remind ourselves of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our prayer to the Lord in the morning may bring us back to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may pray for the Lord to help us keep such laws as doing good, honoring our parents, submitting to our husband, and loving our wife.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may remind me that such laws were taught by the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But I in turn would remind you that while Paul tells the children to obey their parents, he tells them to do it in the Lord Eph 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether it is obeying our parents, loving our wife, or submitting to our husband, we must never do these things outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, we must do them in Christ, in the realm of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today the biggest problem with us is the problem of trying to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is one thing in my life that is particularly difficult for me to overcome my being proud or my tendency to look down on others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Pride is my most difficult problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I was in my late twenties, every day I prayed to the Lord that He would help me to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, I would always have to repent to the Lord for my pride and ask His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Morning after morning, day after day, I petitioned the Lord concerning my pride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet sometimes, even immediately after breakfast, I would have to repent to the Lord for my pride.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes I would pray, Lord, I was proud again just now after breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I looked down on the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lord, help me to not be proud from now until noon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But my experience proved that the Lord never helped me in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only did He never answer my prayer, He frequently sent someone to me to arouse my pride.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes I was successful in not being proud until nearly noon and would happily tell the Lord, Lord, there are only several minutes left until noon.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With Your help I will be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But before I had finished uttering such a prayer, a very peculiar brother would come to me, and my pride would be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Soon I realized that I could not help myself and that I would never have success in the matter of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My story was one of failure instead of success.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although I always tried, I always failed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then one day when I was reading Romans, the Lord showed me that we are dead not only to sin but also to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 7:4 says, You also have been made dead to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Dead persons are neither able to commit sin nor able to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Keeping the law is not the duty of dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no obligation for dead people to keep the law, because, being dead, they have nothing to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Dead persons have nothing to do with sin and nothing to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The day that the Lord spoke to me in this verse, my eyes were opened.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I praised the Lord that I had died not only to sin but also to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to Romans 7, whenever we try to keep the law, that is an indication that we are exercising our self and are still living in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, it means that we have forgotten that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Always remember that if you are trying to keep the law, you are in the flesh, which means that sin will revive and you will die v. 9 . While it is good to die in the sense that we have died with Christ 6:6 , it is not good to die as a result of sin reviving.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever you try to keep the law and live in the flesh, sin will revive and will fight with you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sin will always overcome you and make you a captive 7:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord has to open our eyes so that we can see that we are dead persons who have nothing to do with sin and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such a death has released us not only from sin but also from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By death and resurrection, we came out of Adam and are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Not only so, we have nothing to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Never try to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Just remember that you have died and resurrected with Christ and that now the Spirit of the Lord lives within your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Simply follow Him, walk with Him, and get in line with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then the strongest, most powerful law, the law of the Spirit of life within you, will take care of you and will bring the victory to you.</S>
