        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ARRIVING AT<br />
THE JOY OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how a person is saved, enters into the church life, experiences the Body of Christ, and arrives at the manifestation of the one new man. This is how a person gradually experiences the proper sequence of four levels of joy: the joy of salvation, the joy of the church, the joy of the Body, and ultimately, the joy of the one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL ONE&mdash;<br />
THE JOY OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s thirst indicates that he needs a source to quench his thirst. Man&rsquo;s seeking for satisfaction is proof that there is something in the universe that can quench his thirst and give him satisfaction. Man needs to know God because only God can be man&rsquo;s satisfaction. The Lord, the Creator of all things, is the unique One; there is no other God in the universe. When men do not know the true God, they replace Him with other things and establish religions. Generally speaking, there are five major religions: Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judeo-Christian, and Islam. Confucianism teaches acceptable conduct and relationships among people; it is not about God. Buddhism is also not about God; it stresses transmigration, or reincarnation. Taoism teaches that human life is like wind and vapor; it also is not about God. Although Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism are called religions, they do not talk about God and have nothing to do with God.</p>
<p>The Judeo-Christian religion and Islam come from the same source. The Judeo-Christian religion includes Catholicism, Protestantism, and Judaism. The Scriptures, the Old Testament and the New Testament, which speak concerning God, are the basis of these three. Judaism stresses the Old Testament, whereas Catholicism and Protestantism emphasize both the Old and the New Testaments. Muhammad, the founder of Islam, referred to stories from the Old Testament and the New Testament. Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Islam all speak concerning God&mdash;the sovereign Lord who created all things in the universe.</p>
<p>One day the sovereign Lord of the universe entered into the world by becoming the man Jesus. Apparently, Jesus was merely a man, but in reality He was the omnipresent God. When a person feels that he is a sinner and that he cannot be satisfied in his human life, he can open his whole being from deep within to the Lord and call on His name, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I am a sinner; I need You to save me; I receive You as my Savior.&rdquo; Then something wonderful will take place deep within him. Jesus, the omnipresent God, will enter into him as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The emptiness in the depths of his being will immediately be satisfied, and he will rejoice. From the day a person believes in the Lord, he has the joy of salvation. This is the first level of joy.</p>
<p>In 1938 I preached the gospel at my alma mater in my hometown. A professor who was also a judge came to listen to the gospel and was touched. He asked me to tell him how to believe in Jesus. I said, &ldquo;This is simple. When you get home, shut yourself in your room, kneel down before your bed, open yourself to God, and confess that you are a sinner. You should say, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. I know that You are the true God who came to be my Savior and that You died for me. O Lord Jesus, I believe in You; please save me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This judge was saved, and he testified that he prayed and confessed his sins to the Lord. After he prayed, it seemed as if nothing had happened. The next morning he went to the courthouse as usual. While he was walking to work, he was suddenly filled with joy inwardly. He looked up into heaven and felt that the sky was bluer. Previously, he hated dogs, but that day a dog that he saw looked lovely to him. He was smiling when he walked into the courtroom. His colleagues asked him if he was happy because he had made a fortune. He laughed and said, &ldquo;I do not know why, but my heart is rejoicing.&rdquo; He was still rejoicing when he returned home from work. He was full of joy for several days before he finally realized that he was saved. He prayed to Jesus one night and experienced unprecedented joy the next day. This is a testimony of the experience of the joy of salvation.</p>
<p>In 1940 I was preaching the gospel in Chefoo, and a good number of sisters there had husbands who worked in customs. One day after preaching the gospel, a customs officer asked me how to believe in Jesus. I told him to go home and pray. He was a chain smoker. From the time he stepped into his office until he got off work, he smoked cigarettes. Regardless of how much others advised him to stop, he continued to smoke. However, after praying that night, he did not smoke the next day. At first his colleagues thought that he was playing tricks, but they later observed that he had given up cigarettes. When he discovered that he had changed, he realized that he was saved and had the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>I believe many people can testify that Jesus is the true God, our Savior, our righteousness, and our real satisfaction. Only Jesus can fill the emptiness deep within man. Every believer has experienced the first level of joy&mdash;the joy of salvation.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
