<h2 class=head2>D. A Metabolic Process—Transformation</h2><p>The fourth step of transformation is a metabolic process (Rom. 12:2a). What the human body needs most is the circulation of the blood. But in the blood circulation, new elements and good elements must be added into the blood; otherwise, the blood circulation will be useless. When the Chinese speak of taking care of the body, they mean eating better so that the blood may gain the nutrients. Thus, the blood brings the new nutrients to the different parts of the body, and at the same time, it discharges the old elements from the body. This is metabolism.<p>The Lord’s transformation in us is a metabolism. If we were to change ourselves, we would not have the new elements, and our change would be only an outward cosmetic change. But the transformation which the Lord is carrying out in us is with the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit. When we fellowship with the Lord, He supplies us within. This supply is a supply of new elements. The spiritual blood circulation also discharges the old things from us. This is a metabolic transformation.<h2 class=head2>E. Not Accomplished in an Instant</h2><p>The transformation within us by the Holy Spirit cannot be accomplished in an instant. The metabolic transformation cannot be carried out in a hurry; rather, it is like taking Chinese medicine where the effect is gradual.<h2 class=head2>F. But Achieved Throughout Our Entire Life</h2><p>The transformation within us by the Holy Spirit is achieved throughout our entire life (2 Cor. 4:16-17). When we contact the Lord daily, we receive the nutrients freshly supplied by His resurrection life. Thus, we will be renewed and transformed in a continuing way.<h2 class=head1>III. THE WAY OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. By Fellowshipping with the Lord without Any Barrier— with Unveiled Face Beholding and Reflecting Like a Mirror the Glorious Image of the Lord</h2><p>The way to be transformed is first by fellowshipping with the Lord without any barrier, that is, with an unveiled face beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glorious image of the Lord (3:18a). Stanza 5 of Hymns, #501 reads, “In spirit while gazing on Thee, / As a glass reflecting Thy glory, / Like to Thyself transformed I’ll be, / That Thou might be expressed thru me.” We must be this way every day. There is a distinct difference between one who reads the Word for ten minutes and prays for five minutes in the morning and one who neither reads the Word nor prays. Every morning we must have fellowship with the Lord in this way, even if we are very busy. Moreover, during the day we also must find time to draw near to Him, to be face to face with Him. Then we will be like a mirror beholding Him and reflecting His glory. Thus, the Lord will transfuse into us the elements of what He is and what He has done. By the power of His life and with His life elements we shall gradually be metabolically transformed to have His life shape. What is most important is that through the renewing of our mind we shall gradually be transformed into His image.<h2 class=head2>B. The Advancing—from One Degree of Glory to Another Degree of Glory</h2><p>Second, the way of transformation is by an increase and an advance, that is, advancing from one degree of glory to another degree of glory (v. 18b). In the pathway of transformation, we proceed from one level of glory to another level of glory, from glory to glory, progressively.
