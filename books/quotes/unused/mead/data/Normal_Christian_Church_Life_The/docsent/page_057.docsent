   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Faith is a most important factor in God's service, for without it there can be no truly spiritual work; but our faith requires training and strengthening, and material needs are a means used in God's hand toward that end.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may profess to have faith in God for a vast variety of intangible things, and we may deceive ourselves into believing we really trust Him when we have no trust at all, simply because there is nothing concrete to demonstrate our distrust.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But when it comes to financial needs, the matter is so practical that the reality of our faith is put to the test at once.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we cannot trust God to supply our temporal needs, then we cannot trust Him to supply our spiritual needs; but if we truly prove His trustworthiness in the very practical realm of material wants, we shall be able also to trust Him when spiritual difficulties arise either in connection with the work or with our personal lives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What a contradiction it is if we proclaim to others that God is the living God, yet we ourselves dare not trust Him for the meeting of our material needs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Further, he who holds the purse holds authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are supported by men, our work will be controlled by men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is only to be expected that if we receive an income from a certain source, we should have to account for our doings to such a source.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever our trust is in men, our work cannot but be influenced by men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a serious misconception to fancy that we can take money from men to do the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are supported by men, then we must seek to please men, and it is often impossible at the same time both to please men and God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His own work God must have the sole direction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is why He wishes us to depend on no human source for financial supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us have experienced that again and again God has controlled us through money matters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we have been in the center of His will, supplies have been sure, but as soon as we have been out of vital touch with Him, they have been uncertain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At times we have fancied God would have us do a certain thing, but He has showed us it was not His will by withholding financial supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So we have been under the constant direction of the Lord, and such direction is most precious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we cease to be dependent on Him, how can our trust be developed?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first question anyone should face who believes himself truly called of God is the financial question.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If he cannot look to the Lord alone for the meeting of his daily wants, then he is not qualified to be engaged in His work, for if he is not financially independent of men, the work cannot be independent of men either.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he cannot trust God for the supply of needed funds, can he trust Him in all the problems and difficulties of the work?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are utterly dependent on God for our supplies, then we are responsible to Him alone for our work, and in that case it need not come under human direction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May I advise all who are not prepared for the walk of faith, to continue with their secular duties and not engage in spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every worker for God must be able to trust Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have real faith in God, then we have to bear all the responsibility of our own needs and the needs of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must not secretly hope for help from some human source.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must have faith in God alone, not in God plus man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the brethren show their love, let us thank God, but if they do not, let us thank Him still.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a shameful thing for a servant of God to have one eye on Him and one eye on man or circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is unworthy of any Christian worker to profess to trust in God and yet hope for help from other sources.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is sheer unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have constantly said, and say it again, that as soon as our eyes turn to the brethren, we bring disgrace on our fellow workers and on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our living by faith must be absolutely real, and not deteriorate into a "living by charity."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We dare to be utterly independent of men in financial matters, because we dare to believe utterly in God; we dare to cast away all hope in them, because we have full confidence in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our hope is in men, then when their resources dry up, ours will dry up too.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have no board behind us, but we have a Rock beneath us; and no one standing on this Rock will ever be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Men and circumstances may change, but we shall carry on in a steady course if our reliance is on God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the silver and the gold are His, and none who walk in His will can ever come to want.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are apt to trust in the children of the Lord who in bygone days have sent us gifts, but they will all pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must keep our eyes fixed on the unchanging God whose grace and faithfulness continue forever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The two initial steps in the work of God are first, the prayer of faith for needed funds, then the actual undertaking of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today, alas! many of God's servants have no faith; yet they seek to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They undertake the work without having the essential qualification for it; therefore, what they do has no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Faith is the first essential in any work for God, and it should be exercised in relation to material as well as other needs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is no faith for funds, then no matter how good the work is, sooner or later it will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When money stops, the work will stop too.</S>
