   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c Its Principle to Be Dependent</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The principle of the tree of life is dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps many of you are not clear about this principle of dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Allow me to use the illustration of graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nearly everyone reading this message has graduated from some kind of school, either elementary school, high school, college, or university.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we may graduate from such schools, we can never graduate from a restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may graduate from studying, but we should never graduate from eating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, we cannot graduate from drinking water or from breathing air.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I encourage you to study well and to graduate from school as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, I would never encourage you to graduate from breathing, for if you do that you will die.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the meaning of this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It means that knowledge creates independence and that life demands dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Obtaining a certain body of knowledge permits us to graduate and to act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, I may not know how to cook.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After studying the art of cooking under an expert chef, I will eventually become knowledgeable, independent, and able to cook without the aid of my instructor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in the things pertaining to life we can never be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are dependent upon life constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been breathing since the day I was born, and I continue to breathe twenty-four hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have never graduated from breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can never be independent of breathing and stay alive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I should not say, "I have practiced enough breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now I am an expert.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can teach you to breathe, but I don't need to breathe myself."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless how old we are, we remain dependent upon breathing because breathing is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God called Abraham to leave Ur of the Chaldees, He did not give him a map.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God did not say, "Abraham, here is a map for your journey.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want to bring you out of Ur of the Chaldees and into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This map is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you follow every turn accurately, you will arrive at your destination."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God simply told Abraham to leave his country, kinsmen, and father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God did not tell Abraham where he should go.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why did God deal with Abraham in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God led him in this manner because, prior to the call of Abraham, the human race had fallen far away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man had forsaken the presence of God and was living absolutely according to knowledge, not according to God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God intervened to call Abraham out of that situation and bring him back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did not give Abraham a map or directions, because His intention was that Abraham had to live and move continually in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's presence was the map.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's presence was the direction, the leading, and the guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If Abraham had asked God, "Lord, tell me where I should go tomorrow," He would have replied, "My child, sleep well and be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not be troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Tomorrow I will be your guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I will be your living map."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No automobile driver likes a back-seat driver.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if you are the driver of a heavenly automobile, you need a co-driver.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you have the living God as your co-driver, you will not need a map.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will be your living map and your living guide.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, you will even cease being the driver and let Him drive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may sit near Him and enjoy His driving saying, "Why must I labor and take care of all the turns?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord Jesus, You do it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, You drive in my place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let me simply enjoy Your driving."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is what it means to be dependent on life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose, on the contrary, that I learn every doctrine, every book of the Bible, and compose hundreds of messages to supply me for a whole lifetime of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I were such a person, I could only give you the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Knowledge does not require our dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once you have acquired knowledge, recording it in your memory or in your notebooks, you may stay far away from the Lord's presence and still work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When you have knowledge, you do not need to depend on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord could be in the third heavens and you in a remote region of the earth and you could still conduct your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The way of life is absolutely different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many times I have been burdened about what I should speak in a forthcoming meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, once I prayed the entire afternoon and evening saying, "Lord, give me a word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>O Lord, what is Your burden?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although I had a burden, I had no clear guidance relating to the content of the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I had to speak that night.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As I entered the meeting hall, I had no word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As the congregation was singing and praying, I was burdened, but still had no word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I continued to pray, "Lord, what is Your burden?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What is Your message?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>O Lord, what do You want me to say?"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although it was time for me to deliver the message, I still did not know what to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I stepped up to the platform and said, "Let us open the Bible..."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even at that very moment I did not know what book.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then I said, "...and read the book of Genesis," although I did not know what chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then I said, "Chapter three," yet I did not know which verse.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only then was I clear to begin a message on Genesis 3:15, which says that the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A living message came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From the beginning to the end I was dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I had no knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All I could do was depend upon the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the principle of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We may apply this principle to the teaching about marriage in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All Christian wives know the verse in Ephesians 5 which tells them to submit to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All Christian husbands know the verse which tells them to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Nevertheless, wives and husbands fail to fulfill the requirements of these verses because they take Ephesians 5 as the tree of knowledge, not as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Husbands and wives, you should not live according to the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You must live by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As a wife you should say, "Lord, I don't know how to submit to my husband.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Lord, even if I do know, I cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I will forget about it, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I won't use my effort or energy to fulfill this requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Lord Jesus, I simply stay in Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I want to abide in You and enjoy You twenty-four hours a day."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If you do this, submission spontaneously will flow out of your inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It will be the overflow of your enjoyment of Christ as your inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is dependence on the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What is the principle of the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Its principle is dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We all must be dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Do not take the way of knowledge, for the result of that way is death.</S>
