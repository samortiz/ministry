<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">HOLDING THE HEAD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22; 4:15-16; Col. 2:19</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>In order for God to establish Christ as the Head over all things, He must first make Christ the Head of the church. God must first make Christ the Head of the church before this headship can extend to include all things. The future position of Christ in the universe has much to do with His position in the church today. God must first secure Christ's headship among His children, that is, in the church. This is why it is a crucial matter for Christ to be the Head of the church.</p><p>Christ is the Head of the church, and the church is the Body of Christ. The whole Body is headed up under the Head. Nothing in the Body can exist apart from the Head. If the Body is detached from the Head, the only result is death. Every movement of a human body is governed by the head. If the head is injured and loses its function, the activity of the whole body will cease, and the body will not be able to survive. The head is the hub of the life of the whole body. God's Word tells us that those who have the Son of God have life. A Christian receives life from the Lord, yet this life is never detached from the Lord. Those who have the Son have life, yet this life is still in the Son. This life is never for a moment apart from the Son. Without the Lord, we cannot live. Brothers and sisters, God does not give us a piece of Christ; He has given us the whole Christ so that we may be tightly joined to Him. The power of our existence comes from Christ. If we lose our fellowship with the Lord and if we move away from Him, we will immediately become lifeless. A Christian receives life from the Lord, and the life he possesses is still in the Lord. It is true that we have received life, but this life cannot be separated from the Head. After we have received Him, we must still abide in Him and trust in Him. Therefore, we cannot be independent in anything, because only the Lord is the Head and only He is the source of our life.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Christ is the life of the Body; He is also the authority of the Body. Since life is in Him, authority is also in Him. Since He is our life, He has authority over us. Whenever we submit to His authority, we have life. Every move of our body is governed by the head. For Christ to be the Head means for Him to have the authority in the Body. Brothers and sisters, if we see what the Body is, we will spontaneously come under the control of the Head. The Body cannot move freely; it can only move at the direction of the Head. Without direction from the Head, the Body cannot move. The Body is under the authority of the Head; it cannot propose anything on its own. The power to direct the Body rests with the Head. Where life is, there is authority. In fact, true authority is life. Since the Lord governs our life, He has authority over us.</p><p>Those who say with their mouth that they understand the life of the Body need to ask themselves further whether or not they are under the authority of the Lord. Whether we are under the authority of the Head determines whether we know the life of the Body. Toward God's Word, some have the attitude: "Although the Lord has said this, yet..." Who has given us permission to say "yet"? What authority do we have to say "yet"? In the world anyone who disobeys the command of his superior is lawless. If Christ is the Head, then we cannot be the Head and we have no right to disobey Him.</p><p>What does it mean to follow? To follow means that someone else decides your footsteps and destiny. This is the meaning of following. To follow the Lord means that you have no right to decide your own way. Have you ever said to the Lord that He is the unique authority and that you do not have any choice of your own? The only responsibility the Body has toward the Head is submission and obedience. If you want to live the life of the Body of Christ, you must cover your head and not have any opinion, proposal, or thought of your own. You can only submit to the Lord and allow Him to be the Head. If the Lord is the Head, no one else can be the head. You cannot be the head, nor can anyone else in the church be the head. The Body can only have one Head and can only submit to one Head. Only Christ is the Head, and therefore, you must submit to Christ.</p><p>However, many times there are too many heads in the church. There are many human leaders, methods, and ordinances in the church. Man wants to be the head. Christ is the Head in heaven, and man wants to be the head on earth. When the "head" on earth agrees with the Head in heaven, there is obedience. But when the "head" on earth does not agree with the Head in heaven, there is disobedience. How wrong this is! In the church only Christ is the Head; there is no other head. As long as Christ is the Head, no one else can be the head. Brothers and sisters, have you ever said to the Lord, "Lord, You are my Lord. I have no right to make any decision, and I have no right to choose anything. May You deliver me from being my own head and from taking anyone else as the head"? Brothers and sisters, we must all learn to receive orders from God. Christ is the Head, and no one can walk according to his own will. It is a basic Christian experience to surrender to the Lord and submit to Him.</p><p>Acts 2 shows us Peter's preaching of the gospel: "God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified" (v. 36). The minute he opened his mouth, he spoke about Christ as Lord. Christ is not only the Savior but also the Lord. We all need to have the Lord as our Lord, and since we have all sinned, He must be our Savior. Consider Paul's experience when he was saved on the way to Damascus. The Lord shone His light on him, and he asked the Lord, "Who are You, Lord?" (9:5). Paul first saw Him as Lord and then believed in Him as the Savior. Brothers and sisters, if our eyes are opened, we will say, "Lord, I am through. From now on, take control of me; be my Lord."</p>
