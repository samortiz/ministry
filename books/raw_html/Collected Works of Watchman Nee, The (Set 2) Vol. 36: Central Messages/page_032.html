<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD BEYOND TIME</h2><p>What is the purpose of speaking about this? We have to realize that this has much to do with our life. If we truly see this, we will be led to know God more. Anyone who wants to know God needs to be delivered from the limitation of the concept of time. If a person is bound by the concept of time, he cannot even be saved. Do not think that time is nothing; time is a very crucial thing. We want to prove this point specifically by the following four items.</p><h2 class="head2">Example One&mdash;The Forgiveness of Sins</h2><p>First John 1:7 says, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin." When we preach the gospel, we usually tell people that the blood of God's Son Jesus cleanses us from all our sin. Someone may ask, "How could the blood of the Lord Jesus cleanse us from all our sin?" We tell him that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, paying the price for our sins. Our sins have been cleansed by the blood He shed. But others may not understand and ask, "How is this possible? The Lord Jesus was crucified more than nineteen hundred years ago. On the day He died, I was not even born yet, and I had not committed any sins. How could He die for someone who was not born yet and had not committed any sins?" Brothers and sisters, when you encounter this kind of problem, how should you answer? When you encounter this kind of problem, you should realize that this problem occurs because people have brought in the concept of time. However, the Lord's cross transcends time. When people bring in the concept of time, there is no way to understand the cross.</p><p>We need to remember that Christ is the One who now is. In God there is no distinction between past and future. In God it is always today. God is the One who is from eternity to eternity. From the ages past to the ages in the future, He has not changed. God does not have any past or future. God is the God who now is. If we bring time into our concept, we cannot communicate with God. When we look in the Greek New Testament, we will find out that 1 John 1:7 is in the present tense. It does not say that the blood of His Son Jesus cleansed all our sin in the past. Neither does it say that the blood of His Son Jesus will cleanse all our sin in the future. All of our sins are cleansed now, not in the past or in the future.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, before we were saved, our minds were filled with the concept of time. We thought of Jesus as someone far away. Not only did He live far away geographically in the nation of Israel, but in time there was a gap between Him and us of more than nineteen hundred years. How could He have died for us? How could a past Savior save a sinner today? The Lord Jesus was a past Savior, but I am a sinner today. How could One who lived in the past save me in the present? It was incomprehensible to us; we could not fathom it. Then one day, we said to our God, "I do not know everything. But I know this: I am a sinner. I know I need to be saved and now is the time for me to be saved." At that moment, God opened our eyes and we saw Jesus the Nazarene crucified for us on the cross. It was as if He were stretching out His hands and saying to us, "As long as you come to Me, as long as you do not refuse Me, everything will be all right." At that instant, we received Him with tears as the Savior. Brothers and sisters, at that time did you consider the question of time? Did it occur to you that He was a past Savior and that you were a present sinner? Our experience tells us that from that day forward, time did not present a problem to us, and we did not think of the cross as a past event anymore. God is the God who now is. Our words cannot express this thoroughly. All we can say is that God is present. In fact, even the word present is not adequate to express this characteristic of God.</p><p>The ashes of the red heifer in Numbers 19 signify the Lord's redemption. These ashes mingled with running water and sprinkled upon a person made a person clean. The death of the Lord Jesus is likened to the red heifer being burnt to ashes. According to history and to man's view, the Lord Jesus died nineteen hundred years ago. However, one day the Holy Spirit revealed to us the fact of the Lord's accomplishment. That is like running water being mingled with the ashes: when we received what He accomplished, we were cleansed. In the Spirit, the Lord's redemption is not something of the past, but something of the present. The Holy Spirit is God's power today. The Holy Spirit unveils all the facts in God to us and makes them ours today.</p><p>We need to remember that God is the present God; in Him there is no past. Everything we do will pass away, but what God has done will not pass away, because He is life and He is always living. To man, God's works are related to time; one may say that such and such a thing was done in the past, or that such and such a thing will be done in the future. Yet in Him everything is present because He is the perfect life; He is so perfect that there is no possibility of advancement anymore. Human beings make advancements; when we advance, something becomes the past. I advance a little now, and after a while I advance some more. When I move on, the things that happened before become things of the past. On the one hand, there is a constant advancing, while on the other hand, things are constantly turned into past history. However, God remains the same from eternity to eternity. Therefore, there is no past with God; nothing in God can pass away. God is the God of life, and He lives forever. In God one cannot find anything that belongs to the past. When a person is saved, his eyes are opened at least once to see that the Lord's work is neither past nor future. Therefore, he receives the Lord Jesus. We need to be saved from the concept of time so that we can know this God who is not limited by time.</p>
