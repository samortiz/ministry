   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE NINE CHRIST FIRSTBORN FROM AMONG THE DEAD Scripture Reading: Col 1:18-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the book of Colossians reveals that Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the universe there is God the Creator, and there is the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to 1:15, Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that He is nothing less than God Himself in full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, Christ is the firstborn of creation, the first among all God s creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has accomplished two creations, the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The old creation includes heaven, earth, mankind, and millions of different items.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The new creation is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 15 through 17 unveil Christ as the first in the original creation, as the One who has the preeminence among all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 18 shows that Christ is the first in resurrection as the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the One who has the first place in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first creation came into being through the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the words of Romans 4:17, God called the things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The new creation, on the contrary, came into being through resurrection, through the death and resurrection of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this new creation, the church, Christ is the firstborn from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE TWO BIRTHS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Son of God, Christ has passed through two births.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first birth took place at His incarnation, and the second, in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All Christians realize that Christ was born through incarnation, but not many regard His resurrection also as a birth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 13:33 indicates that Christ was begotten, or born, in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through resurrection He was begotten as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, before His incarnation, in eternity, He was already the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why then did He need to be born the Son of God in resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before His incarnation, Christ was not a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was simply the infinite, eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in the fullness of time, Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of Mary, and nine months later He was born in a manger in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to John 1:14, the Word who is Christ became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that He took the step of becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How marvelous that through incarnation the infinite, eternal God became a man!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, in becoming man, He did not cease to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, Christ was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in resurrection He took a second step to be born the second time and become the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before His resurrection, Christ was the only begotten Son of God John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But through resurrection the only begotten Son became the firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Hebrews 2:10, God is leading many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These many sons are the many brothers of Christ as the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through the two births of Christ, divinity has been brought into humanity, and humanity has been brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the incarnation of Christ God was brought into man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Prior to Christ s incarnation, God was outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, through Christ s incarnation God was brought into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may say that with the birth of Christ God was born into man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, by Christ s first birth in incarnation God was brought into man and became one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then through Christ s resurrection man was brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, God was living in a man, for God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now, through Christ s resurrection, man has been brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hallelujah, as a man Christ is in the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has been brought into man, and man has been brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What a transaction!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What marvelous two-way traffic!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this two-way traffic God came into man through incarnation, and man was brought into God through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Have you ever heard that Christ, the Son of God, has passed through two births?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may have heard that you needed a second birth, the birth in the spirit through the Holy Spirit, but not that Christ was born twice, first in incarnation and then in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In eternity Christ was God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Through His incarnation He became a man, and through resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST S TWO BIRTHS</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through Christ, God has been brought into us, and we have been brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Praise Him for such a mingling!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we were born again, simultaneously Christ was born into us, and we were brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, in our Christian life we have an inward and personal experience of both of the births of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With Christ, His birth in resurrection came thirty-three and a half years after His birth through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, in our experience of Christ, God was brought into us and we were brought into God at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Praise the Lord for the marvelous traffic between God and us!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Colossians 1:19 says that all the fullness was pleased to dwell in Christ, and 2:9 declares that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 2:10 Paul goes on to say that in Christ we are made full.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because all the fullness dwells in Christ and because we have been put into Christ, we have been made full, filled with the divine riches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hallelujah, in Christ we are made full!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In a very real sense, we who believe in Christ are complex, for we are in the One who is very complex.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If He were not complex, there would have been no disputes regarding His Person.</S>
