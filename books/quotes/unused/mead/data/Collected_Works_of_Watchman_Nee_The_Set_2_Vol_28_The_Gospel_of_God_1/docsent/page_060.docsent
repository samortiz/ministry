   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 John 1:9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us come to a verse many love to quote, that is, 1 John 1:9, which says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are a number who, based on this verse, state that confession is indeed a requirement for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, I must draw your attention to several points in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, what is mentioned here is definitely not public confession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First John 1:9 deals with our problem before God when it says, "If we confess our sins."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This differs from the current practice of open confession before men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First John 1:9 does not say anything about open confession.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, the pronoun "we" in this verse is not like the same pronoun used in the books of Romans and Galatians in that it has nothing to do with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Epistle of 1 John is also different from the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John's Gospel shows us how an unbeliever can obtain life, whereas his Epistle tells us how one who has life proves before man that he possesses that life in fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His Gospel reveals the way to receive life, whereas his Epistle discloses how one who possesses such a life goes about demonstrating what he possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, properly expounded, the "we" in this verse does not refer to sinners, but to believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Gospel of John describes the way a sinner is justified by God, but 1 John indicates how a Christian may restore his fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Word here does not discuss how the world can believe in Jesus to have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It indicates how a person who has eternal life and is a child of God can have his sins forgiven by God and have his unrighteousness cleansed when he fails.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, this verse makes reference to the believers alone, those who have been saved and justified, those who possess eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Remember that, whereas an unsaved person is forgiven of his sins by faith, a saved one is forgiven by confessing his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sinners are pardoned by believing in the Lord, and Christians are forgiven by confessing their sins before their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First John 1:9 does not deal with the sins of a sinner but with those of a believer, not with the sins committed before one's salvation, but with those committed after one has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consequently, this verse has nothing to do with our present subject.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would not be so strict as to say that this verse can be applied only to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, I would admit that one may borrow from a host of Scriptures and utilize them to get people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Recently a sister told me that a lady was saved by reading the phrase, "The seed is the word of God" Luke 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not know how this could have happened.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I first preached the gospel, I was convinced that it takes clear gospel Scriptures to get people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, much experience in recent years has taught me, and I say this reverently, that many are actually saved by strange verses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One cannot imagine that verses as strange as some are can save people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not insisting that no sinner could be saved by 1 John 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am saying that when John was moved by the Holy Spirit to write his Epistle, in his mind the ones referred to in this verse were Christians and not sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He originally intended them to be for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although one may temporarily borrow this word and apply it to a sinner, he should not keep on borrowing it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Strictly speaking, such a verse refers to Christians and does not imply that one must confess his sins publicly and make restitution to others in order to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matthew 3:5 and 6</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are another two verses which seem even more obvious than 1 John 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are Matthew 3:5 and 6, which say, "At that time Jerusalem and all Judea and all the surrounding region of the Jordan went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are told when the people heard John's testimony and realized their own sinfulness, they went out to be baptized by him and confessed their sins while they were being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Again, a few matters should be noted in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, neither of the two verses indicate that the people took confession as their way to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They did not try to obtain salvation through confession.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are merely told that when they heard John's preaching of repentance, they were compelled by the Spirit to be baptized and to confess their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They were in fact looking to the very Lord who was to pass through death and resurrection, and in whom they hoped for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Though John did baptize, his hands were actually pointing them to the Lord Jesus who was among them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was he who said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In baptisms of the church, and in the baptism of John the Baptist, the Christ who died and rose is referred to.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John readily admitted how little he was worth by declaring that "He must increase, but I must decrease" John 3:30 , and that the people should not believe in him but in the coming One.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although he did prepare the way, he was not the way; the way was the coming One to whom he pointed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How then were the confessions made?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since John did not tell them to come and confess their sins, his listeners must have done it on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us assume that one of us who is a worker has just finished witnessing for the Lord, and without any kind of urging, charging, demanding, or suggesting, the audience has been deeply enlightened by God in the conscience concerning their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are compelled to rise up to admit that they have committed certain particular sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To this I would surely say, "Amen" and "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I would speak praises and never oppose this sort of open confession before men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If John were to say that a man could not be saved or forgiven unless he confessed his sins, and if John actually encouraged, prompted, commanded, and induced the people to confess their sins, then his actions would hardly match the record in Matthew 3:6.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to this verse, his listeners confessed their sins on their own; they were not encouraged by John.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not presume that I do not believe in the confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have often encouraged the brothers and sisters to make confessions to others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet we refuse to accept confession as the means to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is only one means of salvation prescribed in the Scriptures, and that is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The ancient John the Baptist never urged anyone to confess his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Neither should any modern John the Baptist urge man to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Of course, if a person, upon realizing his own sins, should stand up to make a confession on his own, we have to let him do so.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may have heard of the great Welsh revival.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I had occasion to study in detail reports on that revival.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many have made studies on it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This greatest of all revivals began between the years of 1904 and 1905.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A correspondent of a well-known British newspaper actually went to Wales in 1909 to conduct an investigation of the event.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Wales was not a small place.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The pastors of one of the cities told the reporter that the number of souls saved had declined to almost nothing during the previous two years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the correspondent inquired whether the revival was in recession, they replied, "Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no one around here any longer who is asking to be saved, because everyone has been saved already!"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Knowing that the revival began with Evan Roberts, he then asked concerning his whereabouts.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They answered, "We have no idea."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When he asked them about their meeting time, they said, "We do not know."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Likewise, when he questioned them about the meeting place, they repeated, "We do not know."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They did not seem to know who the leader of a revival meeting was, nor the time and place of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The reporter then asked what he should do, to which they responded, "We meet anywhere at anytime, even at midnight or the early hours of the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We do not know where Evan Roberts is, but he may appear at anytime.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is a revival gathering in almost every home.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You find people praying in different homes at different hours through the night.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But it is difficult to find Evan Roberts.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Nobody knows where he will be."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The reporter remarked that he had never witnessed revival like this in his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He was determined to find Evan Roberts.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>His efforts in the next few weeks, however, failed to yield any results.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One day, when someone told him that Evan Roberts was in a small chapel, the reporter dashed off immediately to the place.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He remarked that the meeting he came upon was most chaotic.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A mother was breast-feeding her baby; a few were running in and out of the meeting as if they were salespersons of some sort; another mother was comforting a crying child, while yet another was using a chair as a cradle, rocking her child to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The place was in a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>And yet there seemed to be an inexplicable and unique element in the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>"Where is Evan Roberts?" the reporter asked.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>"The fourth man on the third row," someone answered.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"Mrs. Penn-Lewis is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There she is on that row."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They were all silent in their seats.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Once in a while someone would stand to call a hymn, or another might rise to read a few verses from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When one or two hours went by without a single word from the people, no one dismissed himself.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>At times some would stand to confess their sins on their own without being admonished to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Friends, such a work is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is different from platform sermons concerning deathbed stories with an intention to convince the audience that they must either confess their sins or else not be saved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I am not forbidding confession.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There are times when one should confess his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>At times one might even declare to a crowd what kind of person he once was and how God had worked in him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>However, none of these should be the result of a preacher's prodding from the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Sometimes there is more than prodding; it is as if some are commanding.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>What is in Matthew 3:6 is indeed public confession, but it is the spontaneous result of the work of the Holy Spirit and not an outcome of John's charge.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I am not opposing open confession; I am merely opposing this kind of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Much more, I am not opposing the work of the Holy Spirit; I wish there were more of such works!</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If a person is led by the Spirit to confess his sins, we all have to say, "O God, we thank and praise You, for You have worked among us."</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But we have to oppose any teaching that says confession must be done in a certain way and to a certain degree before certain results will be achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We cannot exchange confession for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We must not take confession of sins as our way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We have to note that in the sentence, "And they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins," the main predicate according to the original language is not "confessed" but "were baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Thus, the people were being baptized by John in the Jordan River, and while they were being baptized, they also confessed their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We may say that "he spoke, walking," which would mean that the person was speaking and walking at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>While both "spoke" and "walking" are verbs, "spoke" is the main predicate and "walking" the subordinate verb.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Hence the man was speaking, but he was doing so while he was walking.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Similarly, in Matthew 3 they were baptized in the Jordan River as they confessed, meaning that while they were being baptized, they were simultaneously confessing their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Such is the original sense in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>So you see, the confession there was absolutely not a method, but an action which took place.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>While the people were being baptized, they were admitting that they were wrong in this and in that.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The picture here is one of the Holy Spirit working among them, rather than a work of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>They were being baptized and confessing, just like our example of someone speaking and walking at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In any case, public confession was never treated as a way to be saved in this verse.</S>
