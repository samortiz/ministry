   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE ELEVEN THE FULL SALVATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ITS ISSUES 6 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:13-17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first twelve verses of 1 Peter 1 are deep and full of complications.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These verses cover matters on the divine side, whereas verses 13 through 25 cover matters on the human side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An example of the profound matters covered by Peter in 1:1-12 is the foreknowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to 1:1 and 2, we were chosen according to the foreknowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Can you explain what the foreknowledge of God is?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This matter of God s foreknowledge is deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1:3 Peter says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus Christ is Himself God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How, then, can God be His God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is another profound matter in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the first twelve verses of this chapter the points concerning the divine side are deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The matters on the human side covered in 1:13-25 are more detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This chapter, therefore, can be divided into two portions: verses 1 through 12 covering the divine side, and verses 13 through 25 covering the human side.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verses 13 through 25 cover two main points: a holy manner of life and brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 15 says, But according to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also become holy in all your manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 22 says, Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love, love one another from the heart fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these verses Peter is concerned that the believers would have a holy manner of life and brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have emphasized the fact that the first twelve verses of this chapter unveil profound matters on the divine side.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some of these matters are the foreknowledge of God the Father, regeneration unto a living hope, and an inheritance that is incorruptible, undefiled, unfading, and kept in the heavens for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 13 through 25 are mainly concerned with the development of a holy manner of life and brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are the issues, the results, of the full salvation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GIRDING UP THE LOINS OF OUR MIND</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us now consider verses 13 through 25 one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 13 says, Wherefore, girding up the loins of your mind, being sober, set your hope completely on the grace being brought to you at the unveiling of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verses 3 through 12 are one long sentence of blessing, of well-speaking, of God the Father, disclosing to us His marvelous and excellent salvation, beginning from the regeneration of our spirit v. 3 and consummating in the salvation of our soul v. 9 , accomplished through the sufferings of Christ and His glories v. 11 , and applied to us by the Holy Spirit v. 12 . Based upon this, verse 13 begins an exhortation to those who are participating in the full salvation operated by the Triune God according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To gird up the loins of our mind means not to be loose in our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, most of us are very loose in our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our thoughts jump from one thing to another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a few seconds, in our mind we can travel around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may think about one thing and then suddenly think about something else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, while praising the Lord at the Lord s table, we may suddenly begin to think of something we have just purchased from the store.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because our thoughts can travel so fast, we need to gird up the loins of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here Peter seems to be saying, Brothers, I have just presented you a number of marvelous, divine items.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have read my well-speaking concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has regenerated us unto a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have spoken of God s selection according to His foreknowledge, of Christ s redemption, and the Spirit s application.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now I urge you to gird up the loins of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Don t let your mind be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>BEING SOBER</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 13 Peter also speaks of being sober.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be sober is to be calm and clear in mind, able to realize God s economy in His salvation, as revealed in verses 3 through 12, without being disturbed by fear, anxiety, or any care.</S>
