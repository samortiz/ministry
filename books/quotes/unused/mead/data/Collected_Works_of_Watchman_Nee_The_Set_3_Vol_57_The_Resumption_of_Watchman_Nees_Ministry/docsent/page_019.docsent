   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY FOR OUR WORK TODAY Realizing the Limitation of an Individual</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Being Delivered from Individualism</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has His specific demands; He wants man to learn coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God not only requires that man be delivered from sin, the world, and the flesh; He also asks that man be delivered from his individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With regard to the knowledge of the Body of Christ, man's problem lies in the fact that from the first day he has been taught the wrong things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the Reformation, man has thought that he can be a Christian individually, that he can be sanctified individually, justified individually, and work and serve God individually.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the very beginning this realization has been wrong, and the way a person takes subsequent to this is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man thinks that as soon as he believes in the Lord, he only has to be zealous, to consecrate himself, and to give up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, a man must realize that he is not only a man of unclean lips, but that he also dwells in the midst of a people of unclean lips Isa 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While it is wrong to have unclean lips individually, it is equally wrong to dwell in the midst of a people with unclean lips.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we lay a good foundation today, the situation will change drastically within twenty or thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must see that a person cannot be a proper Christian individually; he must follow the footsteps of the flock, and he must never hold on to any form of individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After a person is saved, he must immediately be brought to see that he belongs to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Being joined to the Body is the meaning of the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a new believer is joined to the Body through the laying on of hands, he can no longer be an individual Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must be brought to a point where we acknowledge the limitation of the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word is easy for the young ones, but it is difficult for those with considerable gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, we must see that even members as great as the hands and the feet are but hands and feet only; they must accept the other members before they can become complete.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must recognize our own limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Problems arise in the church because some people think that they are all-inclusive; they want to do everything by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the hand can only be the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It cannot see, and it cannot hear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It has to accept the seeing and the hearing of others before it can enjoy the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not matter how great a gift I am; in many areas I have to accept the supply of others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some can only be cells.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely they need others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The question is whether or not they would ask others to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their basic need is to acknowledge their own limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They have to acknowledge that they cannot see, speak, or hear.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to clearly identify our own limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may not know something, but there are others in the church who will know.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fact that I do not know something does not mean that everyone else does not know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have to live by others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I may not be able to walk, but others can walk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Never think that we can preach the Head without preaching the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we depend on the Lord, the more we will realize that we have to depend on the members.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not accept our own limitations, we will never find the way that others have opened up already.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as the question of limitation is not resolved, we can never advance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What we have individually is very little.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not think that we are so capable or clever, and we should not think that we will never be wrong and that others are always wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all have to humble ourselves and be delivered from our pride and our individualism to receive the supply from others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who are accustomed to their cleverness and who think highly of themselves should make a turn and have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the first point.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Submitting to the Authority of the Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, not only do we have to acknowledge our own limitations; we have to know submission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Body of Christ, ministry means authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whoever can hear and speak is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a member can see, he is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His ability to see is his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a member can hear, his ability to hear is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you want to hear something, you have to submit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Either you walk blindly, or you have to submit to the eyes for your seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is no one in the church who does not have to submit to someone; everyone has to submit to those assigned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The problem today is that many brothers and sisters think that the supply others have received will not work in them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They think that they have to receive something directly from God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man thinks that he can do without man's preaching, but God's commandments come through His ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this reason, we must learn to submit.</S>
