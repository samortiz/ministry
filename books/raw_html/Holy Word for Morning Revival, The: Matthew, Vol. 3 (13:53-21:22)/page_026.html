<p class="bold">WEEK 14 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 18:28-35</h2><p>28 &nbsp;But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a <sup>1</sup>hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.</p><p>29 &nbsp;Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you.</p><p>30 &nbsp;But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.</p><p>31 &nbsp;Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly <sup>1</sup>grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place.</p><p class="bold">32 &nbsp;Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me.</p> <p class="bold">33 &nbsp;Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you? </p><p class="bold">34 &nbsp;And his master became angry and <sup>1</sup>delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed.</p><p class="bold">35 &nbsp;So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Verse 28…definitely refers to things that take place in this age.</p> <p>How small is any brother’s debt to us compared to our debt to the Lord!…Nevertheless, we may not be willing to forgive [vv. 29-30]. The offended brother, the one not willing to forgive others, was certainly saved. Thus, in this parable the Lord is dealing not with sinners, but with believers, with saved ones. He deals with a brother who has been offended, yet who is not willing to forgive.</p><p>In verses 15 through 20 the emphasis is on the offending brother needing to repent. But in the parable the emphasis is on the offended one needing to forgive. Both our unwillingness to repent and our unwillingness to forgive will keep us out of the kingdom…not only in this age but in the coming age.…Perhaps you have not heard such a serious word before and were misled concerning this matter. Many Christians do not know how to interpret this part of the Word because they have not seen God’s dispensational administration. They do not realize that God has ordained three ages: the present age, the coming age, and the eternal age. According to Matthew 12:32, certain sins cannot be forgiven either in this age or in the coming age. This indicates that other sins can be forgiven in this age or in the next age.</p><p>If we do not practice the way of repentance and forgiveness, the longer we stay in the church life, the more offenses there will be.…This will annul the kingdom life and cause us to forfeit the church life. May the Lord grant us the grace we need. If I offend you, I need to go to you and repent. If you offend me, I need to look to the Lord for the grace to forgive you from my heart. And once I have forgiven an offense, I should forget it and never mention it again. If we do this, we will have the proper kingdom life. Then we will share in the manifestation of the kingdom. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 616-618, 621-623)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>28<sup>1</sup> Less than one ten thousandth of ten thousand talents. It refers to a sin committed against us by a brother after we are saved and become slaves of the Lord.</p><p>31<sup>1</sup> Our not forgiving the brother who sins against us will grieve the other brothers, and they may bring this matter to the Lord.</p><p>34<sup>1</sup> This refers to the Lord’s dealing with His believers at His coming back. If we do not forgive the brother who sins against us, we will be disciplined by the Lord until we forgive him from the heart, i.e., until we repay all that is owed. Then the Lord will forgive us. This is forgiveness in the kingdom. This implies that if we do not forgive a brother from our heart today, we will not be allowed to enter into the kingdom in the coming age. See note 322 in ch. 12.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 616-623; Hymns: #26</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
