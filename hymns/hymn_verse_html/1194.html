<b>1</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>There are two lines to live by in our living today -</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>One the life line to bring us into Christ all the way.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>But the other is knowledge which will make us die;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>We must be very careful on which line we abide.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:8px; padding-top:8px; ' >
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>We don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Lord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Living in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>2</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>Lord, we would be as Abel, fully contacting You;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Not by knowledge or concept, but by life fresh and new.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Just as Enosh began to call upon Your name,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And as Enoch who walked with You, we'll do just the same.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>3</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>Keep us living and walking as did old Abraham;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>In Your holy appearing to be transfused like him.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>As did Isaac and Jacob, Moses lived this way -</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>So dependent upon Your presence with him each day.</span><br>

<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Daniel prayed to his God and lived by Him constantly.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Jesus lived by the Father to be life complete;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Now as His living Body of the life tree we'll eat.</span><br>
