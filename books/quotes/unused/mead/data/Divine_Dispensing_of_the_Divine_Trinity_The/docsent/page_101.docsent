   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE BIRTH AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the remainder of this message and in the two following messages, we shall give our attention to four matters seen in 1 Corinthians: birth, growth, transformation, and identification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First we have the birth of the members of the church and then the growth and transformation of these members.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We also have the identification of the members of the church with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These four matters of birth, growth, transformation, and identification are profound.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Birth is through the gospel 4:15 and in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Growth is through the planting and watering of God s fellow-workers 3:8-9 and with the essence of God, who gives the growth 3:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Transformation is through the builders building work 3:10-12 and by the indwelling Spirit with the divine essence and element 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Identification is a matter of being one spirit with the Lord as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is by the indwelling Spirit as the mingling and saturating Spirit 6:17, 19 and involves having the Spirit of God 7:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one can fully explain what human birth is, much less the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although it is easy to understand the process of making a wooden table, we do not understand fully what is involved with either a human birth or the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all were born of our parents, but we are not able to adequately explain this birth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we do not know thoroughly what birth is, we can be certain of a basic principle related to birth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This principle is that birth is altogether a matter of the dispensing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Adopting a child, on the contrary, is not related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, adoption involves the fulfillment of certain legal requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But birth is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In particular, birth comes through the dispensing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A father s life is dispensed into his child.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the story of one s birth is a story of life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BEGOTTEN THROUGH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul says a word concerning spiritual birth in 4:15: For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Greek word translated guides here means child-conductors.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These guides or child-conductors give instructions and directions to the children under their guardianship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fathers, however, impart life to the children whom they beget.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was such a father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He had begotten the Corinthian believers in Christ through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He had imparted the divine life into them so that they could become children of God and members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 4:15 Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians, You Corinthians were all reborn through me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am your begetting father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was through me that the divine life was dispensed into you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through this life-dispensing the Corinthians had experienced the new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps you have never realized that when you were regenerated, you received a rich dispensing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Apart from the dispensing of the divine life into our being, we never could have experienced the divine birth, a spiritual birth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The spiritual birth, the new birth, is totally a matter of the dispensing of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our regeneration was the beginning of the dispensing of the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From the time we were born of God, this dispensing has not ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we shall see, the divine life in us will grow, will increase, through the continuation of the divine dispensing.</S>
