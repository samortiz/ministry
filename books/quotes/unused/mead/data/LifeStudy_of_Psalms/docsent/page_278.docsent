   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To the experienced ones God makes His ways known, and to the younger ones, to the children, He makes His acts known.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both His ways and His acts are benefits to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 12 through 14 declare, "As far as the east is from the west,/So far has He removed our transgressions from us./As compassionate as a father is toward his children,/So compassionate is Jehovah toward those who fear Him./For He knows our frame;/He remembers that we are dust."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The east and the west have no end. How good it is that as far as the east is from the west, so far has God removed our transgressions from us! Furthermore, as verse 14 indicates, He knows our frame, our body, much better than any medical doctor can know it.</S>
