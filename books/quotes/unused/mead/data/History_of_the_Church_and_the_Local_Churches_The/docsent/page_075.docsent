   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Helping Me to Know the Initial History</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Lord's Recovery in China</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Nee also helped me by sharing with me about the first twelve years of the history of the Lord's recovery in China.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since I was not absolutely in the recovery during that period of time, he spoke to me in much detail about this history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time I did not know why he was doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later I realized that he was laying a good foundation for me and building me up for my service to the Lord in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Helping Me to Know the History of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He also helped me by relating to me the history of the church, from the first century to the present century.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My knowledge of the history of the church came mostly from Brother Nee's sharing with me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He presented the history of the church with its direction toward the goal of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Helping Me to Know the Bible in the Way of Life</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee also helped me to know the Bible in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Brethren taught me to know the Bible according to the letter, but Brother Nee helped me to know the Bible in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through all the personal times I had with him, he helped me in the above four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I owe Brother Nee so much for all the help he gave me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BEING BROUGHT INTO THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>WITH BROTHER NEE THROUGH TESTING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition to this, Brother Nee brought me into function by giving me the full way to participate in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I bore much responsibility in the church in Shanghai, and that gave me the best opportunity to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before he put me into such a position, he tested me, and his way of testing was hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One day he brought a bundle of letters to me, written by different persons with questions for him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These questions were about subjects such as the church, the church's ground, life, and the interpretation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He asked me to answer all the questions for him in reply to all those letters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I told Brother Nee that I might not know how to answer some of the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He told me to do as much as I could.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I eventually found out that this was his test.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By having me do that, he found out how much of the truth was in me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not too long after my arrival in Shanghai, the brothers asked me to speak to the saints in a conference in the second hall; at that time the church in Shanghai had two halls.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing exposes where a person is more than his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a person speaks, everyone knows where he is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I spoke for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee was not there, but he received a report concerning everything that I spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That was also a test to me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later, I was asked to speak in the first hall, the biggest and primary hall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church had arranged to have a big gospel-preaching meeting, but no one knew who was going to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No doubt, many thought Brother Nee was going to be the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I was delighted and happy to be able to hear a message and learn more about how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>About an hour before the meeting, a small slip of paper was delivered to me from Brother Nee charging me to give a message on the gospel that night.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I had no choice but to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That night I gave a message on John 16:8-11.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 8 says that when the Spirit comes, "He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I told the people that sin, righteousness, and judgment are related to three persons: Adam, Christ, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sin entered through Adam Rom 5:12 , righteousness is the resurrected Christ John 16:10; 1 Cor 1:30 , and judgment is for Satan John 16:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All of us were born of sin in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only way to be freed from sin is to believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we believe into Him, He is righteousness to us, and we are justified in Him Rom 3:24; 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe into Christ, the Son of God, we will remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity Matt 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are the main points of the gospel, with which the Spirit convicts the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I gave this message, I did not see Brother Nee in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Quite a time later, we were taking a walk together, and he said to me that not many people could give such a message on John 16 concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment being related to Adam, Christ, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He encouraged me to go on in my pursuit of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was surprised to find out that he knew the content of my message.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He told me that while I was speaking, he was standing behind me, behind the back door, listening to me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My preaching that evening in the gospel meeting was another test to me.</S>
