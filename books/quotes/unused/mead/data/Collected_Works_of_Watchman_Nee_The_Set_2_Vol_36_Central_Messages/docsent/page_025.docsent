   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IS THE RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider again what resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whatever encounters death and still exists is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Resurrection is that which withstands death and endures death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, death came in and man died.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who enter the grave never come out again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once they go in, they never return.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the whole universe, of all men, only one came out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This One is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord said, "I am...the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever" Rev 1:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord is the resurrected Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Resurrection is that which passes through death but is not imprisoned by death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible, the authority of death is described as a kind of imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To imprison someone is to confine him and not release him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once man enters death, he cannot come out anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Death imprisons everyone who enters it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But death cannot imprison Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the meaning of life, and this is the meaning of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Resurrection is the life that passes through death and rises above death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our Lord Jesus is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He became dead and was in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was in the deepest place of death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But death could not imprison Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Death was unable to detain or keep Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He came out of death!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When life passes through death and is not imprisoned by death, this is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Resurrection means that a life bears the mark of death, yet still lives; it is living, yet it also bears the mark of death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what is meant by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people ask why is it that after His resurrection in John 20, the Lord Jesus left the mark of the nails in His hands and the mark of the spear in His side for Thomas to touch v. 27 . We have to realize that this is what is meant by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus was not showing Thomas one who had never been wounded and one who had never died; He wanted Thomas to see that He was wounded but now alive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He wanted Thomas to see that He had died but now lived.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord has the mark of death in His body, yet He is now living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what is meant by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can apply this principle to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are many things in us that do not have the mark of death; they cannot be considered as resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Resurrection must be something that has the mark of death and yet is still living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not think that as long as you have eloquence, cleverness, and talent, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is possible for you to have eloquence without the mark of death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is possible for you to have wisdom without the mark of death, and it is possible for you to have talent without the mark of death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether or not others see the mark of death in our eloquence, cleverness, and talent determines whether we have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A brother may be very competent, capable, and apparently lively.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, he is too self-confident and self-assured.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He thinks that everything put in his hands will be handled well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no mark of death with this person; one does not see any mark of death in his competence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although he is self- confident, self-trusting, self-assured, and very energetic, the mark of death cannot be found in him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This does not mean that a person who has passed through resurrection has no ability in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It merely means that with such a person, there is the mark of death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He can still do things, but he dares not trust in himself anymore, and he has lost all confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His own energy has been weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul wrote to the church in Corinth and said, "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" 1 Cor 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was spoken by a man who knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What a pity that among Christians, there are too many strong and self-confident ones!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, here is a man who said that he was "in weakness and in fear and in much trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His body bore the mark of death, the seal of death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, resurrection can never be separated from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The cross removes something from us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many things that originate from the self will not rise again once they have passed through the cross; they are lost in death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whatever remains after it has passed through death, and whatever has the mark of death and is still living is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Resurrection must be something that has passed through death and whatever has passed through death must have suffered deprivation and loss.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, if you really see what resurrection is, you will see what the cross is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You will see the stripping power of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you really know what resurrection is, you will find many things removed from you as you pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you really know what resurrection is, you will become another person; many things will be stripped from you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only those things that have life will resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Without life there is no possibility of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose we cut a piece of wood into small segments and bury them into the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After some time, they will decay and become worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, if we cut down a branch from a tree and plant it in the ground, after some time, it will germinate.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In one case the sticks become rotten.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the other case the branch germinates.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Anything that is dead rots, and anything that has life resurrects after it passes through death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, the Lord's resurrection was based upon His life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because there is an incorruptible life in Him, death cannot imprison Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since there is something in Him which cannot die, death was cast away even while He was put into death.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we go through the cross experientially, many things will remain in death and not come out.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only the things which are of God will resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we touch the cross, we ourselves will be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The cross is a big minus; it subtracts many things.</S>
