<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. All Things concerning Man<br>
Being in the Hand of God</H2>

<P>All things concerning man are in the hand of God, and God is inscrutable in His doings (9:1; 8:17; 7:13-14; 11:5).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. God Judging Man in Everything</H2>

<P>God will judge man in everything (3:17; 11:9; 12:14; Matt. 12:36; Rom. 2:5, 16; Acts 17:31; Rev. 20:11-13).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. God Giving Man a Portion<br>
in Human Life for Him to Enjoy and Exist</H2>

<P>God gives man a portion in human life for him to enjoy and exist that God could have an opportunity to call out some for the carrying out of His eternal selection and predestination for the accomplishment of His eternal economy (Eccl. 8:15).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. What Man Should Be to God</H2>

<P>The writer also searched and tested what man should be to God.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Fearing God</H2>

<P>Man should fear God that he may gain the wisdom from God to know how to live the human life and to know God further (7:18b; 8:12-13; 12:13).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Repenting to God</H2>

<P>Man, being fallen from the God-created good condition into his schemes (7:29b) and having a heart full of evil (9:3), not one of whom is righteous, does good, and does not sin (7:20), should repent to God and receive the Redeemer whom God has prepared for him (Job 19:25).</P>
