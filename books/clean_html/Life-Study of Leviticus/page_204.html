<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE SABBATH YEAR AND THE JUBILEE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Lev. 25:23-34</h1><p>Certain crucial words describe the jubilee. Some of these words are shouting, release or freedom, possession, and family. The jubilee is a time of shouting. It is also a time when we are released, freed, from slavery and captivity. We had lost our divine possession, but in the New Testament jubilee our possession has been returned to us for our enjoyment. In the jubilee we are also restored to our family. If we put all these matters together, we shall have a complete understanding of what jubilee is. We were in slavery and in captivity, but we have been released and restored to our possession for our enjoyment and to our family that we may have real fellowship in God’s grace.<p>The year of jubilee was also a sabbath year. This is the reason the first matter revealed in Leviticus 25 is the sabbath year. The eighth sabbath year was the jubilee, a sabbath year full of rest, release, and enjoyment. In this year of jubilee all the divine possessions were balanced again according to God’s economy. The produce of the land became free and common not only to man but also to the beasts.<h2 class=head2>H. The Land Possessed by the Children of Israel Belonged to God and Was Not to Be Sold into Permanent Ownership</h2><p>“The land shall not be sold into permanent ownership, for the land is Mine; for you are aliens and sojourners with Me” (v. 23). This signifies that our divine possession belongs to God, and we cannot lose it forever, even though we might become defeated or fallen. It is safeguarded by God’s grace.<p>In the New Testament there is much teaching concerning the kingdom reward and the kingdom punishment. We may be defeated and even disciplined during the millennium, but our spiritual ownership of the divine possession cannot be lost permanently. After the millennium, those believers who are disciplined will be restored to the ownership of their divine possession, especially in the new heaven and the new earth, to enjoy the blessing of the New Jerusalem. It is of the grace of God that we shall be restored to our divine possession for eternity.<h2 class=head2>I. Concerning the Redemption of the Land That Had Been Sold</h2><p>Leviticus 25:24-28 speaks of the restoration of the land that had been sold. This record is very meaningful but rather complicated and thus requires careful attention.<h2 class=head3>1. Regaining Our Enjoyment of the Divine Possession</h2><p>Although we might become weak and backslided and thus lose our enjoyment of the divine possession, we can still regain it. We may lose this enjoyment for a while, but eventually it will be restored to us.<h2 class=head3>2. The Children of Israel Regaining What They Have Lost</h2><p>Although the children of Israel have lost all that they have received from God through the generations, at the Lord’s coming back to them they will regain it. At the Lord’s coming back the Israelites will regain ownership of their God-allotted portion.
