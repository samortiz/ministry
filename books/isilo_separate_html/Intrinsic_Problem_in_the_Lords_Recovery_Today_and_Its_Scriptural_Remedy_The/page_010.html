<h2 class="head3">The Seven Golden Lampstands, Symbols<br />
of the Seven Churches, Being All Identical</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:11-12 and 20, the seven golden lampstands, symbols of the seven local churches in Asia, are all identical in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression. In all these aspects the seven lampstands are identical. This signifies that all the local churches should be the same in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression. The seven lampstands were identical to the point that if they were placed side-by-side before our eyes, we could not discern which is which.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seven Churches Differing<br />
in the Business Affairs of Their Administration</h2>
<p>Today a certain kind of teaching is being promulgated among the churches encouraging the churches to be different from one another. However, the normal differences among the churches can be only in the business affairs of their administration. Although the Lord did not touch business affairs in the seven epistles to the seven churches, as a rule, according to their practical needs, the churches should be different in the business affairs of their administration. These affairs include such matters as the times of the church meetings, and whether the church purchases property and builds a meeting hall or simply rents a room or a building for its meetings. In matters such as these, there is no need for the churches to be identical. To require all the churches to be identical in these matters would be very awkward.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seven Churches Being the Same<br />
Normally in the Positive Things</h2>
<p>The seven churches were the same normally in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ. In all the positive things concerning the Lord Jesus, the churches should be the same. In the Lord&rsquo;s speaking to the seven churches, the positive things were commended, strengthened, encouraged, and exalted by the Lord for the abounding. These positive things include: in Ephesus, labor, endurance, and the hating of the works of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:2-3, 6); in Smyrna, the suffering of tribulation, poverty, and trial, and being faithful (2:9-10); in Pergamos, holding fast the Lord&rsquo;s name and not denying the faith of the Lord (2:13); in Thyatira, love, faith, service, and endurance (2:19); in Sardis, not defiling their garments (3:4); and in Philadelphia, keeping the word of the Lord and not denying His name (3:8, 10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seven Churches Differing Abnormally<br />
Only in the Negative Things</h2>
<p>The seven churches differed abnormally only in the negative things, which were rebuked, judged, condemned, and corrected by the Lord for elimination. These negative things include: in Ephesus, some calling themselves apostles and not being such, and the church leaving its first love (Rev. 2: 1a, 2, 4); in Pergamos, the church settling in the world, some holding the teaching of Balaam, and some holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans (2:12a, 13-15); in Thyatira, the church tolerating the woman Jezebel to teach and lead the Lord&rsquo;s slaves to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices (2:18a, 20); in Sardis, the church having a name that it was living but it was dead, and its works not being found by Christ completed before God (3:1-2); and in Laodicea, the church being neither cold nor hot, but boasting, &ldquo;I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing&rdquo; (3:14-15, 17). The Lord&rsquo;s rebuking indicates that the Lord does not want such differences.</p>
<p>By reading the epistles to the seven churches in Revelation, we can see that all the local churches should be the same in positive things, but not in negative things. The churches should be different only in business affairs. For example, whether a church buys a piece of land and builds a meeting hall should depend on the church&rsquo;s need and on the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty. The churches should not be required to follow one another in affairs such as these, but all the churches should be one in all the spiritual aspects concerning the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. This is the first item as the base for us to practice the proper one accord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
