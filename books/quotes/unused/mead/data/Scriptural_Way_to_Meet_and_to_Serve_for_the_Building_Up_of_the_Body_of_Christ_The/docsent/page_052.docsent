   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRIT FOR THE WORKING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MOVING, AND OPERATING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today the Spirit is not far away in the third heavens; He is right here in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we know how to exercise our spirit, the very Spirit in our spirit works together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we exercise our spirit, He works, moves, and operates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This Spirit is Christ 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 15:45b , and Christ is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How wonderful it is that when we exercise our spirit, the processed Triune God works, operates, and even says, Amen within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With this amen we have peace, joy, much encouragement, and boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without such an amen, such boldness, and assurance, I could not speak for very long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if I speak by exercising my spirit, and the very Triune God says, Amen within me, I am encouraged and have the peace, joy, and confidence that I am one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am speaking, and He is speaking in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is really one spirit with me, and I am one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we all experience this, our meetings will be in the third heavens, full of the Triune God, full of Christ, and full of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will have an exhibition of all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt, this kind of meeting will issue in producing and edifying the members of the Body of Christ, and even in the building up of the Body of Christ directly through the members.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what the Lord is doing in His ordained way, which we call the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you stand up to read a verse, you should exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is preferable to exercise the spirit and make mistakes, rather than to make no mistakes but be full of the exercise of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you prefer to exercise your spirit and make mistakes or to be fully right in the mind?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are a spirit-exercising people who make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not exercise our spirit, regardless of how right we are and how few mistakes we make, our meetings will be dead and will not afford any life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we make some mistakes, yet have the exercise of the spirit, people will receive the help in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not care to be a prominent professor, lecturing with the exact pronunciation, accent, rhythm, and voice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am a spirit-exercising man speaking Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as I exercise my spirit in speaking Christ, you will get the help.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I may make some mistakes, but they will eventually not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You do not come to this ministry to listen to a top lecturer; you come to listen to a brother who is speaking Christ to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as your spirit is touched, nourished, edified, strengthened, and built up with Christ, you will be happy and not care about the mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we were young, we studied about D. L. Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After one of his gospel meetings in which many people were saved, a man came to him and told him that his grammar had been incorrect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moody pointed out to him that through his speaking with incorrect grammar many had been saved, and he asked this one how many would have been saved through his own correct speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moody was not a scholar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a worker in his uncle s shoe shop, but he was caught by the Lord to be a full-timer, and I believe that he spoke by exercising his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The spiritual experiences are altogether a matter of the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second Timothy 1:7 says that God has not given us a spirit of cowardice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This giving is the renewing, regenerating, and enlivening of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We had a deadened spirit, but God came to regenerate, renew, and make it alive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No one can stay away from their bothering mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are bothering to us, but we cannot live as a human being without them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we should keep them under the control of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If your spouse looks at you with an unpleasant expression and you exercise your mind, you will be angry with her.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must immediately put your mind under your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The way to do this is by exercising your spirit, and the way to exercise your spirit is by calling on the name of the Lord, which implies praying.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When your spouse has an unpleasant expression, you can say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not argue with her.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once you open your mouth with one word of argument, you will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will come under the control of your devilish mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes you may call, O Lord Jesus and the situation will be calmed down.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, after half an hour a devilish thought may call you back to think about what your spouse did and about how you should not be treated like that.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more you think in this way, the more the demonic emotion rises up, and eventually the troubling will rises up also.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only way to overcome the devilish mind, demonic emotion, and troubling will is to always call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is why the Bible tells us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once you cease to pray, the troubling, demonic, and devilish things rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These things accompany us all the time, even during the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The way to control them is to call, O Lord Jesus, to speak Christ in the spirit, and to say something about God by exercising your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you do not do this, while you are sitting in the meeting listening to the testimonies or message, you may criticize everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The devilish mind always reminds you of people s shortcomings, and the demonic emotions always stir you up to love or hate, adore or despise something.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many times in the meetings we have been in our mind, emotion, or will, but not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many Christian meetings are meetings with the mind, emotion, or will, but not with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is only when we exercise our spirit that the Spirit works, operates, and moves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A meeting with the exercise of the spirit is a meeting full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This kind of meeting issues in the riches of Christ and the building up of His Body.</S>
