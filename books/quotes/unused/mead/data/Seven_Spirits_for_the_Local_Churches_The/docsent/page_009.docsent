   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE FOUR VISIONS IN REVELATION IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Revelation the writer, the apostle John, tells us four times that he was in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first time he was in spirit on the Lord s Day and saw seven golden lampstands: I was in spirit on the Lord s Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet...And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands 1:10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second time he was in spirit, he saw a throne: After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting 4:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The third time, John was carried away in spirit to the wilderness and saw the great Babylon: He carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns...And on her forehead there was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH 17:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fourth time, John was carried away in spirit to a high mountain and saw the New Jerusalem: He carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God 21:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Four times John was in spirit, and every time he saw a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The book of Revelation is composed of these four visions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first vision the apostle John saw the seven golden lampstands, and these golden lampstands are the seven local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the first vision was the vision of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is covered in the first three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE JUDGMENT OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the second vision John saw a throne, and the One who sat on the throne had a sealed scroll in His right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Out of this scroll there were seven seals, and out of the seven seals were seven trumpets, and included in the seven trumpets were seven bowls.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are the different judgments of God upon the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is covered in chapters 4 through 16.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, these thirteen chapters contain the second vision of this book, the vision of the divine judgment of God upon this sinful and evil world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE GREAT BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter 17 John was again in spirit; but this time he was carried away because he was to see something awful and horrible, which no human word can describe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was carried away in spirit into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we would see something, we must be carried away from it a certain distance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are too close, we cannot see clearly, but when we are carried away, it becomes so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John was carried away into the wilderness and had a clear view.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There he saw a sinful woman sitting upon a beast.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the third vision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we read this book carefully with references from other books of the Bible, we will realize that the woman signifies religion, and the beast the political government.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Strictly speaking, the beast here is the Roman Empire, while the woman signifies the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A woman joins herself with a beast i.e., religion joins itself with politics .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On her forehead there was a name written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This vision of the great Babylon is covered in chapters 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord tells us clearly that this woman, the great Babylon, is a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She is also called the mother of the harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who are all her daughters?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not like to say, but I believe we all know.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every Bible student recognizes that the great Babylon signifies the Roman Catholic Church, and the Roman Catholic Church as the great harlot is the mother of many harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Roman Catholic Church is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She has the gold, the precious stone, and the pearls, the three items used for the building up of the New Jerusalem; but she has something more.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us read Revelation 17:4: The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although she was gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls, she was first clothed in purple and scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These are not things for the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, this woman is a real mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is something of gold, precious stone, and pearls; yet these are rather superficial and outward.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She was only gilded with them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first things were the purple and the scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wear scarlet robes and a scarlet hat everything is scarlet, and the pope wears purple.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But there is nothing scarlet and purple in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is undoubtedly something of God in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even such a spiritual sister as Madame Guyon was there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She was a real precious stone, but she was under the purple and the scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is this great Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is the mixture of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The great Babylon is a harlot mother with many harlot daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Roman Catholic Church is the mother, and the denominations are the daughters.</S>
