[1]  THE ASSURANCE, SECURITY, AND JOY OF SALVATION THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION
[2]  If you recently have had the experience of receiving Christ, you may have had times when you doubted the reality of that experience; that is, you may have questioned whether you were really saved.
[3]  I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.
[4]  Not only do we have God s Word outside us telling us we are saved, we also have a witness inside us, telling us the very same thing.
[5]  After a Christian has received the assurance that he is really saved, he may consider, I know that I am saved today, but how do I know that I will be saved tomorrow?
[6]  We have God s selection, His predestination, His calling, His love, His grace, His righteousness, His life, His strength, His unchanging faithfulness, and His promises as the foundation, guaranty, and security of our salvation.
[7]  We have seen the assurance of our salvation, that is, how we know that we are saved.
[8]  However, God s intention is that we not only have Christ, but that we enjoy Him, even to the uttermost John 10:10; Phil 4:4 .
[9]  When we are saved, we become God s temple and have His Spirit indwelling us 1 Cor 6:17, 19; Rom 8:9, 11, 16 .
