   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SIXTY-EIGHT JUBILEE 5 Scripture Reading: Lev 25:10-12, 19-22; Matt 11:28; Phil 4:5-7, 9; Luke 15:23; 1 Cor 5:8; Eph 3:8; Phil 1:19; 2 Cor 12:9; 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing messages we have covered the definition of the jubilee and the blessings of the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we shall begin to consider the living of the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the living of the jubilee we mean the kind of life that lives in the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we shall see, this is a life of resting in the good land Lev 25:10-12; Matt 11:28; Phil 4:5-7, 9 and of enjoying the riches of the good land Lev 25:19-22; Luke 15:23; 1 Cor 5:8; Eph 3:8; Phil 1:19; 2 Cor 12:9; 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE RESULT OF MAN S FALL</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before we consider these two aspects of living in the jubilee, I would like to give a further word concerning man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible reveals clearly that man has become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to God s purpose, man was made to contain God and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for man to fulfill this purpose, it was necessary for man to take God in as his life and then continue to enjoy God as his life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only by taking God as life and enjoying God as his life supply can man live a life to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have often pointed out in other messages, this is the clear revelation in the Bible as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of fulfilling God s purpose, the man created by God was seduced by God s enemy and carried away from God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man sinned against God and became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Unbelievers, of course, do not have a clear understanding of man s fall and its result.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even many Christians who are clear about man s fall do not have an adequate understanding of the issue, or the result, of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we need to be impressed with the fact that the issue of man s fall involves two things: first, man s losing of God; second, man s falling into bondage, slavery, captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Throughout the history of mankind, man has been without God and has been in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For thousands of years man has been in slavery, having lost God as his possession.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is true of every people, race, country, and nation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Sufferings in Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those, especially young people, who are struggling to enjoy life may dream that one day there will be heaven on earth, that a time is coming when there will be a Utopia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I once had this kind of dream, but I woke up from it and realized that human life is filled with all kinds of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who are married have problems, but those who are not married may have just as many problems, if not more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As far as problems and sufferings are concerned, it is difficult to say whether it is better to be married or unmarried.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because believers are eager to learn how to have a happy married life, books on marriage are popular in Christian book stores.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Surely any married person, knowing the problems of married life, would like to know how to have a happy marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The young people, however, do not know how many problems there can be in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I mention this to give one example of the sufferings in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another example is the problem caused by riches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who desire to be rich may not realize that riches can cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I know of a certain brother who has become quite rich in the past twenty years, but his riches have caused him great suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of the trouble and sufferings brought about by wealth, many rich people do not have a long life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are exhausted and weakened by their riches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Recently I read an article in the newspaper about a Chinese man who was once the president of a college in China.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This man is now one hundred years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he reached the age of one hundred, many of his former students held a feast in honor of his birthday.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During the feast he said that he thanked God that he was not a rich man, because if he had been wealthy, he would never have lived to reach the age of one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to his understanding, the lack of riches was an important factor in his living to the age of one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The point we are making is that human life is a life of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both riches and poverty are causes of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who are poor may have anxiety, but those who are rich may have even more anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Another kind of human suffering is that experienced by those who are the leaders of countries.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The president or head of a country must bear a very heavy burden, a burden much greater than that borne by an ordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Anyone who is not in good health should not seek a high political office because the pressure on him will be great.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is another illustration of the fact that human life is a life of suffering.</S>
