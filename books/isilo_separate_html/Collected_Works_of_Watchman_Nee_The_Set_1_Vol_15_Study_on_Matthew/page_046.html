In the previous parable the seed is the word of the kingdom; in this parable the good seed are the sons of the kingdom. In the previous parable the seed is the word of God; in this parable the word passed through men, making them the sons of the kingdom. When the seeds are sown into the ground, one by one they become wheat; when the word falls into our heart, we become sons of the kingdom. By the word we are made sons of the kingdom. First Peter 1:23 says that we have been regenerated through the word. We have received the new life through the word of God. When the word of God falls into our heart, it immediately becomes life.</P><P>The sons of the kingdom are those who belong to the kingdom. From this we can see two meanings of the kingdom of the heavens: (1) The sphere of the kingdom of the heavens in its appearance is as large as the world. (2) When the sphere becomes more restricted, we have only the sons of the kingdom.</P><P>The sons of the kingdom are those who are qualified to inherit the kingdom; they are those who represent the kingdom and who belong to the kingdom. They are the opposite of the sons of the evil one. How can man be regenerated? When a gospel preacher preaches a certain word to you, you believe and receive this word. Then you also receive life, which is in the word.</P><P>Verse 25: "But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away." Here it is the men sleeping, not the sower. The Lord as the sower never sleeps or slumbers. The men were the slaves. Broadly speaking, they refer to us; strictly speaking, they refer to the people at that time. There are two aspects to sleeping: (1) It is natural and therefore cannot be criticized. (2) It is to be tired, that is, not to be watchful.</P><P>The "enemy" is the devil (v. 39), and the "tares" are people. In verse 38, as the wheat signifies men, so the tares also signify men. The "sons of the evil one" are not the unbelievers in the world; rather, they are those who mixed with the wheat, like the mixed multitude among the children of Israel when they went out from Egypt. There have been tares in the church in every age, such as Judas in the early days and H.E. Fosdick [a modernist] in the present time.</P><P>Concerning the wheat and the tares, someone who was familiar with the geographical background of the Jews gave the following explanation: After the wheat and the tares are sown, they sprout and grow up to a height of one foot, two feet, or four feet. At these stages they are the same. When they bear fruit, they are still the same. Not until their fruit has ripened are they distinguishable. The fruit of the tares is black, and that of the wheat is golden yellow. In order to determine which is a tare and which is wheat, one must wait until the fruit becomes ripe.</P><P>"His enemy ... went away." This is the enemy's way of doing things. Bible prophecies tell us that in the last days there will be a great apostasy, a great turning away from the truth. We do not know the truth that they will turn away from, but the Bible tells us how the turning away from the truth will be carried out. It will be just as Paul said: men will forbid marriage and command the eating of vegetables (1 Tim. 4:3)-things related to our conduct. John told us that, with regard to the truth, the apostates will deny the Father and the Son (1 John 2:22). Therefore, John stressed the matter of confessing that Jesus is the Christ. Peter in his second Epistle said that the apostates will care only to have money, and the result they are seeking is the separating of the flock (2 Pet. 2:15). This kind of situation was already mentioned at the time of Paul, John, and Peter. Since the second century there have been countless debates concerning the person of the Lord Jesus. According to history, those who sow the tares are those who deny that Jesus is the Christ, yet they still call themselves Christians.</P><P>Verse 26: "And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also." The clause "when the blade sprouted" has two meanings. First, it refers to the time of the ripening for the harvest. Second, it refers to the time the conduct is manifested. The harvest of the field is at the end of the age. The time of the manifestation of the conduct is indicated in verse 27, where the slaves of the master of the house have already begun to wonder. In the second century, when the heresies were rising up, the slaves had no idea what was happening, so they told the master of the house.</P><P>Verse 27: "And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did the tares come from?" The slaves did not know who had sown the tares. When they saw the tares coming out, they did not understand why it was happening. Today it is the same in pioneering a work. Originally, there are a few very good ones, but later some bad condition suddenly appears. The slaves knew only the result but did not know the cause. However, the master said that it was done by the enemy. The tares are mixed with the wheat. Satan's work is not only to oppose but also to imitate. Not only does Satan transfigure himself into an angel of light, but his followers also transfigure themselves into ministers of righteousness (2 Cor. 11:14-15). If possible, Satan persecutes; if not, he imitates. Therefore, persecution should not be feared as much as counterfeiting. There is not one kind of spiritual experience that Satan cannot counterfeit. Satan will counterfeit even such high matters as the fellowship between God and man and the union of God and man. For instance, Frank Buchman, [founder and director of the Oxford Group], wrote a book concerning regenerated Christians. Although the book was well written, it mentions neither the death of Christ nor the blood of Christ. Without blood, one can still be regenerated! This is really heresy! Buchman also spoke on the union of God and man. How did he put it? He said that all that is required is meditation. He spoke neither of the reading of the Bible nor of the Holy Spirit. It is strange that without reading the Bible or depending on the Spirit, one can still understand God's desire! That he did not touch these things is a real danger. Today the revival movement at Oxford University is of the Buchman group. However, there were students who testified that they did not believe in Jesus of Nazareth. Today Satan counterfeits regeneration, salvation, and the fellowship between God and man. Therefore, without the truth, the experience must be false. When people are saved, they should have a spiritual salvation and not a psychological salvation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
