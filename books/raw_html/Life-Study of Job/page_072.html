<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE THIRD OF THE THREE ROUNDS IN THE DEBATES<br>BETWEEN JOB AND HIS THREE FRIENDS<br>CHAPTERS 21&#151;31</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JOB'S FINAL SPEAKING TO HIS THREE FRIENDS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Job 31:1&#151;32:1</H1><P>In this message we will consider 31:1&#151;32:1, the conclusion of Job's final speaking to his three friends.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. BOASTING OF HIS UPRIGHTNESS,<br>RIGHTEOUSNESS, INTEGRITY, AND PERFECTION</H2><P>In chapter thirty-one Job boasted of his uprightness, righteousness, integrity, and perfection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Restraining the Lust of His Flesh<br>in Fearing God</H2><P>In order to practice his uprightness, righteousness, integrity, and perfection, Job restrained the lust of his flesh in fearing God (vv. 1-4). Job's word in verse 4 indicates that he feared God: "Does He not see my ways/And count all my steps?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not Walking with Falsehood and after Deceit</H2><P>Job boasted that he did not walk with falsehood and after deceit (vv. 5-8). He said, "If I have walked with falsehood,/And my foot has hastened after deceit&#151;/Let Him weigh me in a righteous balance,/And let God know my integrity" (vv. 5-6). Humanly speaking, it was very good that Job did not practice falsehood or deceit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Abhorring Adultery as a Heinous Act</H2><P>Job went on to say that he abhorred adultery as a heinous act (vv. 9-12). Adultery is evil, and we all must hate it.</P>
