   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DANIEL MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Dan 1:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among the many books of the prophets, four books are mysterious: Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We thank the Lord that, through the years, He has opened these books to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this introductory message to the life-study of Daniel, we will consider the subject, the contents, the central thought, and the sections of the book of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE SUBJECT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The subject of the book of Daniel is the destiny of Israel apportioned out by God, the contents of the seventy weeks Dan 9:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The seventy weeks are the destiny apportioned out by God to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This book not only covers the destiny of Israel but also covers the Gentile government and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The large human image in Daniel 2 signifies all of human government from Genesis 10 to Revelation 19.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our understanding of the history of the Jewish people and of the Gentile government would be inadequate without this book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Daniel shows us that Israel and human government are for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the centrality and the universality of God's move, and this move is intrinsically involved with Israel and the Gentile government.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The book of Daniel reveals five particular points concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first point is the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Daniel 9:25 and 26 say, "From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of Messiah the Prince will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks....And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word about Messiah being "cut off" is the clearest word in the Old Testament concerning the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The crucifixion of Christ is the landmark of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the landmark where the old creation was terminated for the germination of the new creation in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ died an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He died, we and the entire old creation died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, His death was an all-inclusive termination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The terminating death of Christ ushered in the resurrection, and in the resurrection the germination of God's new creation began.</S>
