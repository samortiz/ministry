   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Philippians 2:12 says, "So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many have told us that Paul said explicitly in Philippians that we have to work out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are to work out our salvation, does that not mean that we have to do something?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is it true that the Lord has done the work, but man also has to do something?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is like saying that He supplies the material, we supply the labor, and the two of us work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A person says this because he does not understand the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are to work out our salvation, then what has the Lord Jesus done on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What has He accomplished on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a thing has been accomplished, it cannot be accomplished any further.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are a child of God, you cannot become a child of God again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the cross, the Lord Jesus clearly said, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The cross of the Lord Jesus has accomplished the work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It has accomplished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the work of salvation and redemption have been accomplished, there is no possibility for us to work out this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we still want to work out our salvation, we must first overturn the work of the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must declare that the work of the Lord Jesus has not been accomplished; the Lord's work has not been finished.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is why we have to work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times, we do not know what it means to shame others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But once you have experienced it, you will know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, here is a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Someone has asked her to wash some handkerchiefs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After she has washed them, she hangs them up to dry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But another person comes along and takes the handkerchiefs away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When she asks for the reason, she is told that they were taken down to be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is an open shame to the sister, for it means that the other person does not believe that the handkerchiefs are washed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It means that they think that the sister has lied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, for us to work out our salvation is not a glory to Christ but a shame to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible says clearly that Christ has accomplished all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then why does Philippians 2:12 say that we have to work out our salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word work out in the original language carries the meaning of out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should work out our salvation in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Did Paul's word stop here?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If it had stopped here, we would not know what he meant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 13 says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since God has operated in you, it is possible for you to now work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If God has not operated in, we have no way to work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since God has operated in, you can work out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has already saved you within and has given you life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now there is no other way but to let Him come out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God does not want you to work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He wants you to work out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, this is not a question of salvation or perdition, eternal life or eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a question of whether or not one receives the reward after his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has already operated in you, causing you to will and to work for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, you have to work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the proper condition of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, this is your work after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a man has not yet been saved, he cannot work out his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a man does not have life, he cannot live out a life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only after a man has been saved can he work out his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, one sees that there is no such thing as being saved through good works.</S>
