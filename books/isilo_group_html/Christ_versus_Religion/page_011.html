It is I Corinthians 12:13. "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit." It says firstly that we were all baptized in the Holy Spirit, and secondly that we were all made to drink of the one Spirit. We were not only baptized into the Spirit, but also made to drink of the Spirit. Have you noticed these two aspects in this one verse? Suppose I have here a glass of water. To baptize my finger in this water is one thing: the finger is clothed with the water; the water is put upon the finger. But this is just an outward act: something is put on, but not put in. The second aspect is that we are also made to drink the Spirit. When I drink this water in the glass, the water gets into me. To be baptized into is one thing, while to drink of is another.</P><P>Many Christians today confuse these two aspects, thinking that the baptism in the Spirit is equivalent to drinking of the Spirit. This concept is really not logical. When people are put into water, does that mean they are made to drink the water? If so, they will be drowned. To baptize a person is to put him into water, not to make him drink the water. There are two aspects. The Holy Spirit upon us is one thing, while the Holy Spirit within us is another. The Lord Jesus, when speaking to His disciples concerning the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 1:5, 8), said that the Holy Spirit would come upon them, not into them. It was a matter of "upon," not a matter of "in." To be baptized into the Spirit is to put on the Spirit, to put on Christ. Christ is our righteousness, Christ is our covering, Christ is our qualification, Christ is our new garment. But this should not be a mere doctrine. You must put on this Christ, not just receive the doctrine of justification by faith. It must be an experience in the Spirit. You should be able to exclaim, "O God, Hallelujah, I am now in Christ! Christ is the all-inclusive pneuma, and I am in the all-inclusive pneuma. I am standing before You, not in myself, but in Christ&#151;not in Christ as a doctrine, but in Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit."</P><P>We must put on Christ as the new garment, and this new garment is the all-inclusive Spirit. Christ is no more the untreated cloth; He is now the finished garment. In this finished garment we have redemption, resurrection power, and all the divine elements of the divine Person. This new garment is not just a piece of clothing, but the divine pneuma, the all-inclusive Spirit, including Christ's incarnation, His crucifixion, His redemptive work, His resurrection, and His resurrection power. We can put on such a Christ. Hallelujah!</P><P>The Lord Jesus told His disciples, "I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality" (John 14: 16-17). In these verses the Spirit is the treated Christ; this Spirit is the crucified and resurrected Christ. Such a Christ is the other Comforter, the Spirit of reality. "In that day," He said, "ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" (John 14:20). He said in effect, "At that day you will both put Me on and receive Me into you. In that day you will be baptized into Me, and you will also drink of Me." This is the treated Christ, the finished Christ. Christ today is no more untreated; He has been thoroughly and completely worked upon. Now He is the finished garment for us to put on, and now He is also the new wine for us to drink.</P><P>Suppose I have here an orange. Could you drink it? You could not&#151;it is untreated, it must be dealt with first. We could not drink of Christ before His crucifixion and resurrection. On the cross He was cut and pressed by God, and now as the Spirit in resurrection we can drink of Him. We were all baptized into Christ, and we were also made to drink of Christ. How? Because He is now the treated Christ. He said, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water. But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet" (John 7:37-39). Why at that time, when the Lord spoke those words, was the Spirit not yet? Because Christ was not treated yet. After a short time He would be treated, and then resurrected. Now, whoever thirsts may come unto Him and drink. Praise the Lord! Today the Lord Jesus is no more the untreated Christ. Do you want to be baptized into Him? Do you want to drink of Him? "That day" is this day. Today you may know that you are in Him and He is in you. You may be baptized in Him and you may drink of Him. Now, by being baptized into Him, Christ becomes our outward qualification, and now, by drinking of Him, He becomes our inward satisfaction. We are clothed with Him as the Spirit of power and we drink of Him as the Spirit of life that we may enjoy Him as our Bridegroom.</P><P>In the first three new things the new cloth, the new garment, and the new wine&#151;we see Christ. Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion is the new cloth, and Christ from His resurrection to eternity is our new garment and our new wine. The new cloth was just the material for making the new garment. Now we are daily under His covering. and we are daily satisfied by Him. He is everything to us.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ versus Religion &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
