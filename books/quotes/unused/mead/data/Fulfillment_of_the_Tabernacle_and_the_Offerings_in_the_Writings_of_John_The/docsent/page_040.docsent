   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO INDEPENDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today there is much talk about independence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It seems that in the twentieth century everybody wants to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, no one is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are either a dependent of Satan or a dependent of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can never be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are independent of Christ, we are then dependent on Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah, through regeneration we have become dependents of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we are all part of Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>PAUL'S CONCERN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We see the story of the serpent and the bride not only in the Gospels, but also in Paul's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second Corinthians 11:2 and 3 say, "For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ; but I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts should be corrupted from the singleness and the purity which is toward Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul was concerned that the serpent who had come to bite Eve would come to bite the believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once again, this is the story of the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE FINAL WORD CONCERNING THE SERPENT AND THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This story continues until we come to the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the book of Revelation we have the final word concerning the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter nineteen we see that the bride is ready for the wedding of the Lamb v. 7 . Immediately after the wedding, this universal couple will fight against Satan and his followers, the beast and the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss, where he will be imprisoned for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following that, Satan will rebel once more and ultimately will be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the universe will be thoroughly cleared up, and there will be a new heaven and a new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For eternity there will be a universal couple: Christ as the Husband and the church as His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE WAY TO ENTER THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the book of Revelation, the New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb, is also the tabernacle Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The subject of all these messages is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, I am not speaking in this message about the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, I am speaking about the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in John's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is the way to enter into the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way is by taking Christ as the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the sin offering, and the sin offering is the basic offering for us to be equipped and qualified to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have pointed out in a foregoing message that we enter the tabernacle by becoming the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that we ourselves actually are the tabernacle we are entering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not become the tabernacle, we shall not be able to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But how can we become the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We become the tabernacle by taking Christ as the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to take Christ as the offerings and to enjoy Him as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have seen that the Lamb of God in John 1:29 is the totality of all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have also seen that the brass serpent in 3:14 is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the brass serpent also is the totality of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we take this brass serpent we take all the offerings in order that we may become the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then by becoming the tabernacle we are in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not think that the apostles will enter into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No, they will all be parts of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is proved by the fact that the twelve apostles will be the twelve foundations of the city of the New Jerusalem Rev 21:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates that the apostles are parts of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In like manner, we all shall be parts of the New Jerusalem, God's tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do you know how we may enter the church today?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We enter the church by becoming the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are not a part of the church, you cannot enter the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we all are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose we could all be taken away somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then there would not be a church into which some others might enter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The vital point here is that we enter the church by being the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Likewise, we enter the tabernacle by being the tabernacle.</S>
