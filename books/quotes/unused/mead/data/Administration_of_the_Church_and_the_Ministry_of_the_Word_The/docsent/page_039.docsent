   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING WATCHFUL AGAINST A SENSE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NATIONAL SUPERIORITY AND WORLDLY CUSTOMS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The building up of the church does not depend on our acknowledgment of Western things as good.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if eighty percent of the things from the West are good, at least twenty percent of the things in the East are also good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not think that people from the West are one hundred percent correct.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Otherwise, the churches in the East and in the West will not be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Two days ago a Western brother said that several serving ones from the workers house were at a birthday party with his family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He invited the serving ones from the workers house to rejoice with them on his child s birthday.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not bring worldly customs into our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In taking the way of the Lord s recovery, we have not celebrated birthdays for the past thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are not without fault, but some Western missionaries should be criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have come to the East to do the Lord s work, but they are also damaging the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To celebrate their children s birthday and even invite serving ones to participate is a fleshly act that will damage the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This may encourage those who live in the workers house to celebrate their children s birthdays.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have allowed the brothers from the West to influence us instead of our influencing them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who labor for the Lord must be very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we receive an invitation, we must know who is involved and the purpose of the gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We preach the truth concerning not loving the world, and we desire that others would not love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the past thirty years the co-workers have not celebrated birthdays for our children or even our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must learn this lesson to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, our labor will be according to a Chinese proverb which says that we are grinding soybeans without producing any tofu.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our labor will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, we must not be proud or overly humble in knowing the source of a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before inviting a Western brother to speak, we considered the fact that he had publicly thanked those who sent him Christmas cards.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although I received spiritual help from this brother, in this matter he needed to be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If Christmas is condemned by God, then even if people send us cards, we should not thank them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This example shows that not all things from the West are right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They need our help in many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although they have no light concerning the church ground, they refuse to be helped in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They even debate and argue repeatedly concerning the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This displays a sense of national superiority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order for the churches in the East and the West to be built up, the brothers from the West must be open to the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have not been playing games for the past thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have given our lives to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not lightly consider any matter in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be desperate in some matters and let other matters go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We respect the spiritual ministries from the West, but we do not agree that everything from the West is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The churches are before us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We accept the Western brothers who are with us, and we must allow them to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we must learn to know people and to discern matters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must also know what we can and cannot accept.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We even need to discern matters concerning a young brother or a young sister.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should encourage what is proper and restrict what is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Merely preaching the gospel to save sinners and edifying the believers cannot build up the genuine church of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must draw others to Christ and help them to be established and built up in the church.</S>
