   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRUTHFULNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 11:10 Paul said that the truthfulness of Christ was in him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ is became his virtue in his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This virtue of truthfulness has to be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE GRACE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 12:9 the Lord told Paul, "My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time Paul had a thorn which was piercing him, troubling him, hurting him, and giving him pain all the time v. 7 . He asked the Lord three times to remove this thorn v. 8 , but the Lord left the thorn with him so that he might experience the Lord's sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the Lord had taken away the thorn, Paul could not have experienced His sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>CHRIST SPEAKING IN ME</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter thirteen Paul said that Christ was speaking in him v. 3 . This is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have you experienced Christ speaking within you?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BEING WEAK IN CHRIST THAT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>HE MIGHT BE POWERFUL WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This speaking Christ within us is powerful, not weak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if we are to experience Christ as power, we have to learn how to be weak in Him v. 4 . We are always taught to be strong, but we have to learn how to be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are too strong in ourselves, in our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to learn to be weak that Christ might be powerful within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE GRACE OF CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE LOVE OF GOD, AND THE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING WITH US ALL</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul concluded 2 Corinthians by saying, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The grace of Christ is the full enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul wanted this enjoyment along with the love of God and the fellowship of the Spirit to be with us in our experience.</S>
