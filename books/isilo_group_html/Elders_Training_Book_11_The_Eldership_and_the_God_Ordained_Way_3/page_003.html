When God was incarnated as the Man Jesus, He traveled and worked for three and a half years in Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. During this time He was simply carrying out His good pleasure. God created all things, but Satan overthrew them. The universe became overthrown, collapsed, corrupted, and confused, and all things were put in a wrong order. Satan became God's enemy, fighting against God. However, even this fighting is a part of the carrying out of God's good pleasure. Today our eyes are blessed. In these days I thank the Lord that we are not only reading about God's good pleasure, but we are now seeing it being carried out. Our God has a good pleasure to head up every part of His scattered creation in Christ through the channel of the church. The result will be the New Jerusalem in the new heavens and new earth. When God looks at this, He will see His good pleasure. The church is the means for God to gain His good pleasure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Firstfruit<br>of God's New Creation</H2><P>The church is also the firstfruit of God's new creation (James 1:18). God is gaining the new creation by transforming the old creation into something with a new nature. The church is the firstfruit of this new creation. The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church, Having Been Obtained<br>(Redeemed) by God with His Own Blood,<br>Being the Object of God's Love</H2><P>Fourth, the church, being the object of God's love, was obtained, that is, redeemed, by God with His own blood (Acts 20:28). The blood shed by Jesus on the cross was God's own blood. God shed His own blood to pay the cost for the church in order to redeem it. The church became and still is the object of God's love. God's love needs an object. The wife is the object of the husband's love. In the Bible the romance between male and female is used to illustrate God's divine romance. The church is the female in this romance, that is, the object of the divine love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Flock of God<br>as God's Possession, Allotted to the Elders<br>for Their Care</H2><P>The church is also the flock of God as God's possession, allotted to the elders for their care (1 Pet. 5:2-3). The local churches are the flock of God, His possession, His inheritance. He has allotted this inheritance to the elders, who are the trustees. God's possession is given to the elders for their care.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (3) &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
