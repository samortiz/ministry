<h2 class="head3">1. The Physical Body of Jesus<br />Being Destroyed by the Jews on the Cross</h2><p>The physical body of Jesus was destroyed on the cross by the Jews. When Christ became flesh, He took on a physical body. In John 1:14 we are told clearly that His physical body was a tabernacle. According to chapter two of John, His physical body was also the temple. I wish to point out that throughout the New Testament, the temple of God does not denote a place; it denotes a Person. When Jesus was in the flesh, His body was the tabernacle and temple of God. Both the tabernacle and the temple are God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Satan knew this. Since Satan realized that the physical body of Jesus was God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth, he did his best to destroy that body. And he did destroy it on the cross through the Jews. In a sense, Satan destroyed the Lord&rsquo;s physical body; in another sense, the Lord Jesus gave up His body to death. The Lord seemed to be saying to Satan, &ldquo;Satan, do your best. Let Me see what you can do. Whatever you do will just give Me an opportunity to do something further.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head3">2. Jesus Raising Up His Physical Body<br />in Resurrection to Be the House of God</h2><p>After Satan destroyed the Lord&rsquo;s physical body on the cross, His body was put into a tomb and rested there. The Lord Jesus then went into death, took a tour of the Black House, and came out in resurrection. When Jesus arose, He Himself raised up His dead and buried body. The body of Jesus that was destroyed on the cross was small and weak; the Body of Christ in resurrection is vast and powerful. Which do you prefer to have&mdash;the body of Jesus or the Body of Christ? After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, His Body, that is, the temple, was reared up on a much larger scale. The body the enemy destroyed by crucifixion was merely the body of Jesus; what was raised by the Lord in resurrection was not only His own body, but everyone who is joined to Him by faith (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6). After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, Satan would have had to say, &ldquo;I lost my case. I was stupid. I shouldn&rsquo;t have destroyed Him.&rdquo; Nevertheless, it was too late for Satan to repent.</p><p>Once a local church has been damaged and destroyed, you can be assured that, in resurrection, it will become even larger than it was originally. The Lord Jesus is always more prevailing than the enemy. Do not be frightened by Satan&rsquo;s work. Many times there is no need for us to pray so desperately. We should simply say, &ldquo;Satan, do your best. Whatever you do will simply afford the opportunity for our Lord Jesus to overcome you.&rdquo; Whenever a problem comes to the church, many brothers feel that they should immediately call a meeting and pray. However, you do not need to be that hasty. Be at peace. Do not be terrified by Satan&rsquo;s activity. When the Lord Jesus knew that the Jews were attempting to destroy Him, He did not pray, &ldquo;O Father, kill all these Jews. Father, save Me and protect Me.&rdquo; Instead of praying that way, the Lord seemed to tell them, &ldquo;Do your best to kill Me. Be assured that after you put Me to death I will have the opportunity to increase.&rdquo; No one can frustrate the purpose of the Lord. The more the enemy tries to do, the more he affords the opportunity for the Lord to do something more. Whatever the Lord does is always in resurrection. The Lord builds the temple &ldquo;in three days,&rdquo; signifying that He builds it in resurrection.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Resurrection of Jesus<br />Being the Unique Sign</h2><p>The Jews asked the Lord Jesus to show them a sign. The Lord answered, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (2:19). The resurrection of the Lord is the unique sign. In the building up of the church, oftentimes people, like the Jews, will challenge us to see what miracles we can do. We should not be tempted to try to perform miracles. We have to follow the Lord Jesus and let ourselves be put to death. Then Christ will be manifested in resurrection. This is the miracle, the sign, that is needed in the building up of the church. The unique sign for the building up of the church is life in resurrection.</p>
