   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Coming Out of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the wife of Christ, the church comes out of Christ Eph 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as Eve came out of Adam, the church as Christ's counterpart comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because Eve came out of Adam, she had the same life and nature that Adam had.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This signifies that the church has the same life and nature that Christ has.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This reveals that the church, the wife of Christ, is a pure product out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church, therefore, must be one element the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 To Be One with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church as the wife of Christ comes out of Christ to be one with Christ Eph 5:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as Eve became one flesh with Adam Gen 2:24 , the church becomes one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ and the church being one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 , as typified by Adam and Eve being one flesh, are the great mystery Eph 5:32 . d.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Man</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Finally, the universal church is the new man Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Ephesians 2:15 we see that Christ created the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This new man is corporate and universal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are many believers, but there is only one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the believers are components of this corporate and universal new man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The emphasis on the church being the Body of Christ is on life, whereas the emphasis on the church being the universal new man is on Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the Body we need Christ to be our life, and for the new man we need Christ to be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1 Not of the Natural Man</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church as the new man is absolutely not of the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After referring to the new man in Colossians 3:10, Paul goes on to say in verse 11, "Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that in the new man there is no possibility, no room, for the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the new man there is room only for Christ, not for any kind of natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2 With Christ as All the Members and in All the Members</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Colossians 3:11, in the new man "Christ is all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is all the members of the new man, and He is in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "all" here refers to all the members who make up the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, Christ is all the members; on the other hand, He is in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that Christ is all the members and that there is no room for the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It also indicates that as members of the new man we continue to exist, but we exist with Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, Paul says that in the new man Christ is both in us and that He is us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the new man Christ is everyone, and He is also in everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the new man is a constitution of the mingling of divinity with humanity to make one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this entity both the intrinsic and extrinsic elements are mingled into one because Christ is the members of the new man and is also in the members.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the universal church.</S>
