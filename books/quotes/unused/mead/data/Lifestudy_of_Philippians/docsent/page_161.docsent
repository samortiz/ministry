   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR PURSUE TOWARD THE GOAL FOR THE PRIZE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE HIGH CALLING Scripture Reading: Phil 3:10-14; Rom 8:11; Rev 20:6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This message will focus on two words found in 3:14 goal and prize.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we reach the goal, we shall receive the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, pursuing toward the goal is for obtaining the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what is the goal, and what is the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many would answer that both the goal and the prize are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although such an answer may be regarded as correct, in this message we need to see from 3:10-14 something particular concerning the goal and the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Philippians 3:10-13 helps us understand the goal and the prize in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 11 we may say that the out-resurrection is actually a synonym for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 10 Paul speaks of knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse indicates clearly that if we would know Christ, we must know His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, many Christians neglect this important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At most, they know only Christ and His death, not the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among Christians today rarely is there a proper and adequate message on the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Few preachers speak of the power of Christ s resurrection in the way Paul spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have pointed out that Paul s desire was to gain Christ and be found in Him, to know Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Knowing Christ in this way is the result of gaining Him and being found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The thought here is so deep that few Christians have given it the attention it deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our natural mind cannot touch the depths of what it means to know Him and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At this juncture we need to ask an important question: Where is Jesus Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this message I would answer by saying that Christ is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No doubt, on the one hand, Christ is in the heavens and, on the other hand, He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, I want to emphasize the marvelous fact that Christ today is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day, as the One who existed in eternity, Christ became a man by incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, He was crucified and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through death He entered into another realm, the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His preexistence, Christ was God and was with God in eternity; by incarnation He became a man in the flesh; and then, through crucifixion and burial, He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have you ever heard that Christ is now in resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the day of His resurrection angels told the women that Christ could not be found in the tomb, for He had risen from the dead Luke 24:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that Christ is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because Christ is now in resurrection, we cannot know Him experientially unless we know the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today some Christians know Christ in His incarnation and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in Philippians 3 Paul aspires to know Him not only in His death, but even the more in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 11, a continuation of verse 10, Paul says, If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The expression the out-resurrection is puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After Christ was resurrected, He became a person wholly in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, the resurrection wherein Christ is today is not an ordinary resurrection, like the resurrection of Lazarus; it is an extraordinary resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, Paul adds the prefix ex to the Greek word for resurrection to show that Christ s resurrection is extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His resurrection is the out-resurrection.</S>
