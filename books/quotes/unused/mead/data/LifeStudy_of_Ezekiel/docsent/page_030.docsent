   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Sanctifying Fire</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Becoming the Sanctifying Light</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever the coals are burning, the torches will be shining.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that the sanctifying fire becomes the sanctifying light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more the fire burns, the more the light enlightens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the fire burns us thoroughly, we will be enlightened thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if we do not allow the sanctifying fire to burn us in a certain matter, we will not be enlightened regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The areas in which we have been burned by the sanctifying fire spontaneously become the areas in which we are enlightened and concerning which we can enlighten others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a particular aspect of your character has been burned by the sanctifying fire, in this matter you will be enlightened, and thus you will be able to enlighten others in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more intensely the fire burns in the church, the brighter will be the shining in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything negative will be exposed and burned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the proper church life there should be nothing of darkness among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every corner should be thoroughly enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, it may be that when you visit a certain local church, you have the sense that that church is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nothing is clear, and nothing is in the light; rather, everything is dark, and every part is under darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is darkness because the church is divided and does not have the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the church has the proper coordination, everything will be under the light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Having a Fire Going Up and Down</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among the coordinated living creatures, who are burning coals and burning torches, there is the fire going up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that the fire is not static but is always moving, because the fire is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever the church is properly coordinated, burning as coals and enlightening as torches, there will be the divine fire going up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fire among the living creatures has its source in God s burning fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s fire is not next to the living creatures; it is above them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is fire with the living creatures because in their fellowship they allow God to move freely among them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the fire in their fellowship is the likeness of God s fire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, Ezekiel 1 shows us that God is a burning fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, this chapter shows us that there is a burning fire among the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The likeness of God is burning fire, and the likeness of the four living creatures also is burning fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that the living creatures have the likeness of God s sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are like God in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this we see that the more we are burned and enlightened, the more we have God s likeness and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are fervent and bright, we will be full of God and will express God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Brightness of the Fire</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>and the Lightning in the Fire</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ezekiel 1:13b says, The fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fact that the fire was bright indicates that the living creatures manifested a glorious and majestic condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This should be the condition in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If this is the situation in the church, there will be no discord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the contrary, the younger ones will obey the older ones, and the older ones will serve the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a situation is beautiful and radiant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we want this to be the condition of the church, we must be thoroughly burned and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we are burned and enlightened, the more others will see the brightness of God s glory, beauty, and majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the fire there is not only brightness but also the flashing of lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whereas the brightness is usual, the flashing of lightning is special, as it is often related to storms and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ordinarily, the church should be full of God s enlightening with its brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, at special times in an emergency or in a crisis there may be the flashing of lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that at special times there may be a special light that flashes suddenly and causes others to be astonished.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not Walking but Running</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 14 says, And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This indicates that the living creatures, having such a coordination, being the burning coals and the burning torches, and having the fire going up and down, will not walk but run.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They run because they have the power and the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In some churches, however, there is no running.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, there is fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other churches the saints are either sitting or squatting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In still other churches they may be crawling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A proper church is a church that runs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church runs because in that church there is the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church runs like lightning, and as the church runs it gives light to others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the coordination, and this is the proper move of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every local church should be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since the coordination is for the move and the move is in the coordination, with such a coordination there is the move of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These verses in Ezekiel 1 show us how to have the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have seen that if we would have this kind of coordination, we need to have four kinds of walk: the straight forward walk, the backward walk, the sideways walk to the right, and the sideways walk to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This will give us a good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a result of this coordination, we will become burning coals and shining and enlightening torches, and we will have God as the divine fire among us going up and coming down.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This will become our power and our impact.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Others will see the light in our running.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Wherever we go and whatever we do, we will manifest the lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>With us there will be the flashing of light, causing others to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This moving is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such a coordination will bring in the Lord s presence and blessing, and it will keep the church in a proper balance, preventing it from going to extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should apply this matter of coordination not only in a particular local church but also among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means that we should be followers of the churches 1 Thes 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are one Body in one move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When one church takes the lead in a definite direction under the leading of the Holy Spirit, we all should walk backward and sideways to follow.</S>
