   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>People easily understand this aspect of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When people speak of sin, they are usually referring to sins, to sinful acts.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unrighteousness includes everything that we should not say or do but, nevertheless, say and do, and it also includes everything that we should say or do but, nevertheless, do not say or do.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin James 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If someone does not fulfill his human responsibility of doing good before God, he has committed a sinful act and falls short before God.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All that is not out of faith is sin Rom 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man should do everything before God in faith, and everything should be done because of faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever is not out of faith is unbelief toward God, and it is offensive to Him.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Anything of man that falls short of the glory of God is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All have sinned because all that we are and can do fall short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While those who are bad certainly fall short of God s glory, even those who are good fall short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While those who are immoral fall short of God s glory, even those who are moral fall short of God s glory.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sin is manifested outwardly in the various unacceptable acts committed before God.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since Jews have broken the law which God gave them and Gentiles have broken the law in their conscience 2:14-15 , which was also given by God, all have sinned before God.</S>

   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Sin, death, judgment, and eternal perdition are like four links in a chain.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The first link is sin, and the last link is eternal perdition.</S>

   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, just as the first two links sin and death are real, the final two links judgment and eternal perdition are real, regardless of whether or not people acknowledge them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Sooner or later everyone who does not believe will experience every link in this chain because he is handcuffed to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>As long as a person is chained to sin, he cannot escape from death in this age or from judgment and eternal perdition after death.</S>
