   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message we come to the third step of God's move in man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God first moved in man in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God was born into the womb of a virgin, and after nine months Jesus was born out of that virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A key verse concerning God's incarnation is Matthew 1:20, which says, "That which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Something was not only conceived in the virgin Mary but also born into her.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was the first step God took to move in man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second step of God's move in man was His human living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>People saw Jesus as a man living, walking, working, and ministering on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No one can deny that in history there was such a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But while this man was living, walking, working, and ministering on this earth, another One lived there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Jesus' living, God was living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Jesus' walking, God was walking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Jesus' working, God was working.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Jesus' ministering and serving, God was there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the man Jesus was the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this message we want to see the third major step of the move of God in man, and this step was His move in the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ was crucified, but in His crucifixion God was moving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The previous messages concerning the move of God in man were entitled In His Incarnation and In His Human Living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But I want us to notice that I did not entitle this message In His Crucifixion but In the Crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to be careful by saying that God moved in the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not safe to say directly In His Crucifixion, that is, In God's Crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we say In the Crucifixion of Christ, we are very safe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we fellowship about the crucifixion of Christ, we need to see who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, we have to see that Christ is the embodiment of God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since this is the case, He was the very God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the end of John 10 the opposing Jews confronted the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 31 says that they were about to stone Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me?" v. 32 . Then the Jews answered Him, "We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God" v. 33 . Throughout the centuries there have been great debates over the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His person is related to the Divine Trinity because in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This subject In the Crucifixion of Christ implies the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not say directly and initially that the crucifixion was God's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, we should say that this was Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are sharing the truth concerning the crucifixion, we need to take steps like that of a stairway.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not jump from the top of a building to the ground floor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to commit suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, we must have a stairway.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without His Divine Trinity, God could not have moved in the crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Who can crucify God?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet Charles Wesley said in one of his hymns: "Amazing love! how can it be/That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?" and "'Tis mystery all!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Immortal dies!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hymns, #296 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Charles Wesley said that God died for him and that the Immortal One died.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that He who cannot die, died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one could crucify God if He remained in His divinity, but Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Divine Trinity is involved here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The crucifixion of Christ was the death in which God moved in man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God moved in another's crucifixion, but this other One is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first One moved in the second One's death, and the second One is the embodiment of the first One.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the stairway we need to understand the crucifixion.</S>
