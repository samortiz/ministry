   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As we read this story, we see Joseph's patience and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only a matured person has such patience and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more matured we are, the more wisdom and patience we have.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although Joseph was just about forty years of age, in his spiritual life he was matured.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because he was spiritually mature, he had great wisdom and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, he was not governed by his desire or emotion, but directed by his wisdom and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the church life today we all, especially the elders, need a life of wisdom and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What the elders do should not be under the direction of their emotion, desire, or intention.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although your intention may be very good, you may cause damage to others if you are governed by your good intention.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>None of the elders or leading ones in the church or in the work should be governed by his intention.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the contrary, we must be governed by our wisdom and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It takes no maturity to be directed by your intention or desire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But it does require maturity to be directed by patience and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the story of Joseph's revealing himself to his brothers we do not see any display of childishness on his part.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being full of patience and wisdom, he conducted himself according to the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was tried by his brothers' ignorance and blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But instead of being manipulated by his intention or desire, he was completely under the control of his wisdom and directed by his patience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In patience and wisdom he gave his brothers all the tests they needed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we are not as mature as Joseph, we may think that he was too severe and troublesome in dealing with his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But Joseph was not a troublesome person; he was a person fully matured and governed by wisdom and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He knew what was the best time to reveal himself to his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His acknowledgment of them was not directed by his desire or his feelings; it was completely under the direction of God's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In wisdom, Joseph gave his brothers another test.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By giving them this test, he gave them another opportunity to consider his identity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But, as we have seen, they remained ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, he arranged for them to be brought back to him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they returned, they were fully subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Judah said to him, "What shall we say unto my lord?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What shall we speak?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Or how shall we clear ourselves?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>44:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Judah spoke to him like this, Joseph still did not reveal himself to them, but continued to be patient, testing Judah to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not say that Judah was mature in life, but at that moment he had improved very much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By the way he spoke to Joseph we see that he was a subdued, broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The attitude and spirit in which he spoke to Joseph about his father touched Joseph deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was through Judah's talk with him that Joseph became convinced that his brother had learned his lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That was the right time for Joseph to reveal himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time, all his emotions burst forth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not think that Joseph was emotionless like wood or stone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No, he was full of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Look at the way he wept when he revealed himself to his brothers 45:1-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He told all his servants to leave the room, and then his emotions burst out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that Joseph was very emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since he was so emotional, how could he have refrained from expressing his emotion for at least several months?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fact that he could do this was a sign of his maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not know how to control our tears, laughter, or anger, it means that we are childish in life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The strongest sign that we are matured is that we are able to control our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we pointed out in a previous message, when the two sons of Aaron were burned in the presence of God, there were indications that Aaron was forbidden to weep Lev 10:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Aaron might have said, "My two sons have just died in my sight and you ask me not to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moses, you are not human."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both Moses and Aaron were in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moses could serve God in His presence because he knew how to control his feelings of sympathy for his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Aaron took Moses' word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether or not you should weep, laugh, or be angry depends upon the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not in the world, but in the presence of the Lord in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When you are about to express your emotion, you should not do so according to your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, you must express your emotion according to God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Does God's presence allow you to laugh?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Does it allow you to weep?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should not say, "I have just lost my sons and I am very sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I simply cannot control myself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I must weep."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you say this, it reveals that you are not mature.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Joseph could be the ruler in Egypt because he was mature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Being mature, he ruled over himself and over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At the right time Joseph wept regarding his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even this reveals that he was a person fully under the control of God's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In chapters forty-two through forty-four Joseph did not weep in the presence of his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But in chapter forty-five, after the brothers had passed through the dealings and had learned their lessons, Joseph wept.</S>
