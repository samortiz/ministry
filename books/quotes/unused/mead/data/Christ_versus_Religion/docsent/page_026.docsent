   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Revelation of the church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peter had seen the revelation of Christ, and the Lord Jesus appraised him well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in the following verse, the Lord Jesus said, "And I also say unto thee..." v. 18 . Peter had just received the first fifty percent of the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The revelation He had seen was utterly right, but it came short.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Peter had seen who Christ was that was wonderful, but it was not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must underline the little word "also" in the beginning of verse 18 it is tremendously significant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In using this word the Lord Jesus, in effect, was saying unto Peter, "What you have seen is absolutely correct, but it is just fifty percent, just the first half; you still need the second half."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then Jesus proceeded to speak to Peter about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first half of God's divine revelation is Christ, and the second half is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first half is the Head, and the second half is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you would see a person, and his head only is unveiled, your revelation is not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must not only see the head, but also the body, to see the person in his entirety.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yes, you may have seen Christ that is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But you must realize that God's purpose not only involves the Head, but also His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have seen Christ, but for God's purpose you must also see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So the Lord Jesus said, "And I also say unto thee..."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must underline, circle, and color the little word "also."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In all these years since we have seen something of the church, we cannot avoid telling others what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of this, we are accused of speaking too much about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some dear friends say that they are for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as they have Christ, say they, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are always speaking about the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We too have seen the Head, but we have also seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We tell people that the Head is indeed important, the Head is precious, the Head is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if you have only a head without a body, what kind of person is that?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have only Christ without the church, what is that?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose that when we meet together the head of one of the brothers comes floating into the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We would probably all flee in terror.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The head needs the body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oh, how much Christ needs the church!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The problem is that people have talked much about the Head, but have neglected the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some indeed have not only neglected the Body, but even opposed the Body and would stop others from speaking of it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So we must not only point others to the Head, but also to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not only Christ, Christ, Christ, but also the church, the church, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, the Lord Jesus was saying to Peter, "It is wonderful that you have seen Christ, but you must see something more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And I say also unto you that I will build my church on what you have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are Peter, a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I will build you with others as my church upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Henceforth you are no more an individualistic individual; you are just a stone built into the house, a member built into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will build my church that means that I will build you as a stone with all the others as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the basis upon which I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You, Simon, are not worthy to have the keys.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No, you are not qualified; but as a stone in the building, a member in the Body, you are positioned to have the keys of the kingdom of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The revelation we must have is firstly of Christ, and secondly of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is indeed sad today that in Christianity so many refer to Matthew 16, but they always speak of Christ, not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must see something of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The great mystery of God is Christ and the Church Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the revelation.</S>
