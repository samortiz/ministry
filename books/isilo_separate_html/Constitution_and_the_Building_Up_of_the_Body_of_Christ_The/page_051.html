The Positive Organic Reaction of the Divine Life<br>in the Believers' Entire Being</H2><P>The inward transformation in our nature and essence is the result of the positive organic reaction of the divine life in our entire being. Within us there is the divine life, and with the divine life there is always some positive, organic, and living reaction. We have a living reaction within us because we have the divine life in us. This reaction of the divine life in our entire being preserves us. We must allow the Lord Jesus to occupy our entire being&#151;our mind, emotion, and will&#151;for our transformation in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Metabolic Constitution<br>in the Believers' Renewed Being</H2><P>Every day the Lord is renewing us, and His renewing is a kind of metabolism to supply us with His new element to replace our old element. This issues in a metabolic constitution in our renewed being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Expression of the Divine Image's Attributes<br>in the Believers' Renewed Being<br>to Be the Virtues of the Believers' New Man</H2><P>In transformation there is the expression of the divine image's attributes in the believers' renewed being to be the virtues of the believers' new man. God is real, living, and present. He has an image and His image has many attributes. When these attributes are expressed within us, they become our virtues. For this to happen, we should not do anything by ourselves or for ourselves. Instead, we should let Him do everything with us and for us. Then He is the divine life within us, moving, living, and working in every part of our being to make our being a renewed being. Then all the divine attributes will be expressed through our virtues. Actually His attributes, such as His love, His kindness, His humility, and His gentleness, become our virtues. We then become persons not living by ourselves but by Him as our new element, causing us to become a new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Manifestation of the Processed<br>and Consummated Triune God<br>in the Believers' New Man</H2><P>Transformation results in the manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God in the believers' new man. Through our transformation the Triune God will be expressed in us. This Triune God is the One who has been processed and consummated, the One who has humanity and who knows what human suffering is. He lives in us, making us just like Him. Eventually, we will fully express Him as the God of love, the God of incarnation, and the God with the elements of humanity and human living.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> </body></html>
