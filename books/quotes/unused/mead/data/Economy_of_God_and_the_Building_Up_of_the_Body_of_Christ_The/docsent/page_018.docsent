   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have seen the first part of God's New Testament economy, which is mainly concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The economy of God is the Triune God working Himself into tripartite men that they may become the members of Christ to be constituted the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This economy of God is to be fulfilled not only in this age but also in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the revelation of the New Testament, the first step God took in order to accomplish His economy was that He Himself became the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through this He became a wonderful God-man, being at the same time God as well as man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the universe, God has two special kinds of creatures: angels and human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The angels belong to the heavens, and man belongs to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If it were up to us, we would probably choose to be an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I was young, I also would have chosen to be an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be an angel is too good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He can live in heaven freely, having in addition the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But it is so troublesome to be a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many distractions and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after being a Christian for sixty years, having gained a more thorough understanding of the Bible, having realized God's economy, and having had some experience, I have to say that I do not want to be an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, I like being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only man is the object of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The angels are but the slaves who minister unto man Heb 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even the God of creation one day became a man for the purpose of accomplishing His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This man was Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was in the same manner as man, with the human life and human nature, having the need to eat, drink, and sleep, and even being able to shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was thirty years of age, He came out to fulfill His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He came to the shore of the sea of Galilee and called the two brothers, Peter and Andrew, saying, "Follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They immediately dropped their nets and followed Him Matt 4:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time, the Lord had not yet entered into them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the three years or more when Peter was following the Lord, most of the time he spoke and acted by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One time he received the revelation from the Father and recognized Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But not long after that, when the Lord Jesus unveiled to His disciples His need to be crucified and resurrected, Peter, in minding the things of man instead of the things of God, became the mouthpiece of Satan and was a stumbling block to the Lord Matt 16:16-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On His last journey to Jerusalem, the Lord Jesus unveiled once more to His disciples His crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only did they miss those words, but they were on the contrary arguing among themselves who should be the greatest among them Matt 20:17-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the night that the Lord Jesus was betrayed, He said to them, "You will all be stumbled in Me this night, for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But Peter answered and said to Him, If all shall be stumbled in You, I will never be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, that this night, before a cock crows, you will deny Me three times" Matt 26:31-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later, Peter did deny the Lord three times before men; then the cock crowed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter thought of the Lord Jesus' word and went out and wept Matt 26:69-75 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even by that time, Peter still did not have the Lord Jesus within him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was not until the Lord Jesus was crucified and resurrected and became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came in the midst of the disciples and said to them, "Peace be to you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then He breathed into them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit which they received was the resurrected Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From that day on, the Lord Jesus entered into Peter as well as all those who believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the Lord ascended to heaven, the disciples went back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There about a hundred and twenty of them gathered together in an upper room and persevered in prayer with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After ten days, when Pentecost arrived, the Holy Spirit was poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter stood up with the eleven apostles and preached the gospel to all those dwelling in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter was no longer the Peter of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is because the Lord who had died and resurrected had entered into him to be his life and everything Acts 1:12-15; 2:1-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This shows us clearly that when God became flesh, He lived the human life for thirty-three and a half years, experiencing all the sufferings and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In His human life, He lived out God and expressed God among men.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He passed through everything of the human life and was qualified to be man's Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But He still could not enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, He had to go to the cross to accomplish the all-inclusive death so that He could solve all the negative problems in the universe and could release the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After this, He rose from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into the disciples to become their life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In ascension, He gave them as gifts to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These six items God's becoming flesh, His human living, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His breathing into the disciples, and His ascension constitute the major steps God took for the fulfillment of His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this chapter we will go on from the foregoing six major items to see God's economy from the New Testament revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first six items concern the Lord's work on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Starting from the seventh point, all the items concern the Lord's work in heaven.</S>
