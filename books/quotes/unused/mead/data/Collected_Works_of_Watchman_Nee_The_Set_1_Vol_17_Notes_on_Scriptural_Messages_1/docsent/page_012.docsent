   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LUKE 17:26-37</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And even as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building; but on the day in which Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It will be in the same way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In that day, he who will be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Remember Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I tell you, In that night there will be two on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There will be two women grinding together; the one will be taken but the other will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And He said to them, Where the body is, there also will the vultures be gathered together."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These verses tell us the time when the soul is either saved or lost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words in verses 34-35, "I tell you, In that night there will be two on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There will be two women grinding together; the one will be taken but the other will be left," refer to the time of rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The difference here is that one will be raptured and one will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word "taken" means to be raptured to heaven Gen 5:24 ; therefore, what is spoken of in verse 33, "Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive," means that whoever saves his soul in this age will be left behind at the appearing of the Son of Man; whoever loses his soul in this age will be raptured at the appearing of the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no difference between the two persons, neither any difference in their work nor any difference in the place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in the matter of rapture, there is a difference!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In an instant, there will be a tremendous difference!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a sober matter!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we wish to be raptured, to see the Lord and enter into the kingdom, we must first lose the soul in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must forsake the world for the Lord's sake and forsake everything that is not in accord with the Lord's will; we must abandon all that entangles us and hinders our heart from going upward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we want to save our soul and cannot bear to forsake everything, we will, like Lot's wife, not be able to arrive at the place where the Lord will rapture us, even though we will not perish in Sodom and Gomorrah together with the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There may not be any difference in gaining salvation and receiving eternal life, but there has to be a difference in the matter of the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>LUKE 12:15-21</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the meaning of losing the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can find the explanation from reading Luke 12:15-21: "And He said to them, Watch and guard yourself from all covetousness, for no one's life is in the abundance of his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And He told them a parable, saying, The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And he reasoned in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I have no place where I may gather my crops?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And he said, I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and I will gather there all my wheat and my goods.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be merry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But God said to him, Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So is he who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can say that "to gain the soul" is to let the soul gain satisfaction and happiness and to let the soul have enjoyment, while "to lose the soul" is to let the soul be sorrowful, painful, and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of the abundance of his food and his goods, the soul of this rich man is already happy and satisfied in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He has already given his soul enjoyment; he has gained his soul in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, to gain the soul is to let the soul have happiness in this age and to lose the soul is to leave nothing for the soul in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our eyes see, our ears hear, and our hands and feet touch; but the one that is conscious of the happiness in them is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The soul is the seat of our natural desires.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The soul causes us to have sentiments and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The desires of the soul strongly demand satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Beautiful music can soothe emotions; literature and philosophy can elevate thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we gain satisfaction from these things in this age, we will lose satisfaction in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have already gained the comfort given by these things in this age, we will lose the glory of the kingdom in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the one who saves his soul in this age is a Christian believer who has gained in this age the joy of ears and eyes and the happiness of the heart and mind; in the coming age he will lose such joy and happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whoever gains that which belongs to this age will not gain that which belongs to the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a man loses in this age, he will have gain in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should now understand the meaning of the salvation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To gain all the glory, joy, and satisfaction in the kingdom is to gain the soul; to lose all the glory, joy, and satisfaction in the kingdom is to lose the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After we are saved, we cannot be unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But our deeds have much to do with our position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What are you now pursuing?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is very difficult for the young ones to forsake the pleasures of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many want to get satisfaction from housing, food, clothing and entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is to save their soul today; hence, they will surely lose their soul in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A saved person will not go to hell, but in the kingdom there are blessings which he will miss!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord does not teach us asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, the Lord does not want us to be attracted by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These things are all legitimate, but legitimate things are not all profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, Paul says, "All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable" 1 Cor 10:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether clothing, food, or housing, you should not have the consciousness that you are enjoying something.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead you should realize that these things are just good for glorifying God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whenever you have any enjoyment, there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All that gives enjoyment to your soul saves your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The important thing is that one should not enjoy any kind of happiness that is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The one who loves the world is the one who saves his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But sin has entered the world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You should not, therefore, gain anything from this sinful world.</S>
