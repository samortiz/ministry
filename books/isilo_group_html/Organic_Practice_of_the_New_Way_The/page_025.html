<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:24-25; 1 Thes. 2:11; Eph. 4:11-12; Acts 20:20, 27, 31; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Concerning the small group meeting-Heb. 10:24-25; 1 Thes. 2:11; Eph. 4:11-12; Acts 20:20, 27, 31.</li>
<li>Concerning prophesying-1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31, 39.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tonight we will continue with the secret of the new way. First we want to point out two passages in the Bible. The first is Ephesians 4:11-16. The second is 1 Corinthians 14:1-40. Christians throughout the ages have never entered into the experience of these two passages of God&#8217;s words. This is why we have never seen the condition described in these two passages being manifested in church history.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING BEING TO SPEAK FOR GOD<br />
AND TO SPEAK FORTH GOD</h2>
<p>Take for example 1 Corinthians 14. Formerly, we thought that this chapter talks about spiritual gifts. Because of this we did not dive into the depths of this passage. But recently the Lord has shown us specifically that it is not only on spiritual gifts. Rather, it emphasizes and exalts in a particular way the matter of prophesying. Today, many Christians do not understand the matter of prophesying. In the Chinese Union Version, this word is translated as the &#8220;preaching of a prophet.&#8221; But the Greek word for prophesying means to speak for God.</p>
<p>We can see a basic principle both from the Old Testament and from the New, which is that God hardly ever spoke to man directly. For the most part He reveals things to man through dreams or revelations. Sometimes He has to put a man into an ecstasy before such a one can understand the mind of God (Acts 10:10). On the other hand, the Bible shows us that in many portions and in many ways, God spoke of old to the fathers in the prophets (Heb. 1:1). The word <em>prophet</em> refers to one who prophesies. When God has something to say, He does not speak directly. Rather, He takes a man to be His mouthpiece. Such a man then speaks for God and speaks forth God.</p>
<p>When we come to the New Testament, the prophets not only speak forth God; they also speak God into people, which means that they dispense Christ into men. When men hear the words, not only do they receive the words, but they receive into them a Person and a Spirit, who is the Lord Jesus Himself. Hence, to prophesy is to speak the Lord Jesus into people.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:1 says, &#8220;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&#8221; Christians always think that love is the most important thing. Paul indeed devoted the whole of chapter thirteen to speaking of different aspects of love. But at the beginning of chapter fourteen, he mentioned three things, which are love, spiritual gifts, and prophesying. Of these three things, the spiritual gifts were received by us when we were regenerated. The love is also easily obtained. But the most neglected item is prophesying.</p>
<p>The spiritual gifts are the spiritual capabilities. When a child is born, he is endowed with some natural capabilities. He can cry, and gradually he can see with his eyes. After a few months, he can even utter with his mouth, &#8220;Papa, mama.&#8221; This is the result of the gradual manifestation of the capabilities. After this, he begins to crawl and to stand up. This proves that he is a living person, with all the functions of the life within him. All these functions manifest themselves bit by bit as the life grows.</p>
<p>If you are not saved, regenerated, or you do not have the life of God, you would not have any spiritual gift. As long as you are a saved person, you will have spiritual gifts. The life that you received at regeneration is a high life. It is even a super life, one that is divine and eternal. Doubtless, it will impart to you spiritual gifts.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organic Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
