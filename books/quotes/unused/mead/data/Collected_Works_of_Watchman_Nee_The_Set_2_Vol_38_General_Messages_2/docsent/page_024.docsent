   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must not think that the days we have lost are a few, unimportant days.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we consider the journey the Israelites took in the wilderness, we will realize how serious it is to waste our days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Three months after the Israelites left Egypt, they came to Sinai Exo 19:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They remained there for ten months.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year, they left Sinai and traveled toward the land God promised to give them for their inheritance Num 10:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Deuteronomy 1:2 says, "It is eleven days' journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by the way that leads to Mount Seir."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Kadesh-barnea was at the border of the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was only an eleven-day journey from Mount Sinai to Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet when they arrived at Kadesh-barnea, they could not enter Canaan because of their unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After this they wandered in the wilderness for thirty-eight years before their descendants finally entered Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was indeed a big, indirect route!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It took not just three or five years but thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They spent thirty-eight years on a journey to Canaan that should have taken them only two years!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our spiritual journey, there are countless wasted days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some problems can be dealt with in three to five days, yet they remain unsolved in some people for three to five years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These ones are like the Israelites, who circled around in the wilderness and wasted many days.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not consider it to be inconsequential.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The story of Abraham also shows us that parts of his life were counted and parts were not counted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Acts 7:2-3, while Abraham was still in Mesopotamia i.e., in Ur , God appeared to him, saying, "Come out from your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What did he do?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He would not have had peace if he did not obey; yet he was not willing to obey completely.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, he partially obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God told him to come out from his relatives, yet he took his relatives along.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not go alone; rather, he brought his nephew Lot and his father Terah with him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God intended that he go all the way to Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet he went only as far as Haran and stayed there Gen 11:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the picture of a Christian who is not willing to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some Christians are not altogether cold; they still have some glow in them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet they are not hot.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was Abraham's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He left Ur of the Chaldees, yet he did not enter Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was like a halfway Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After his father Terah died, God called Abraham again 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This time, God called him from Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's will cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once He has decided to do something, He will always accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God wanted Abraham to go to Canaan, and Abraham's deterrence in Haran did not change His will at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first time God called Abraham, he only obeyed halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, God called him the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Abraham obeyed God by leaving Haran, the Bible immediately points out that he was seventy-five years old 12:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His years in Ur were not mentioned, and his years in Haran were not mentioned either.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the minute he left Haran for Canaan, the Bible points out that his age was seventy-five.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows us a new beginning in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The days Abraham spent in Haran, the days he tarried halfway, were wasted days; God did not remember those days.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brothers and sisters, in looking back at our past, we find that there are numerous days we have lost!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must remember that God has no concern for the days in Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We often walk according to our self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We become lazy and seek our own comfort; we tarry halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These are days in Haran and days which will not be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to receive blessing from God, Abraham had to leave Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The year he was seventy-five years old was the year he left Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Until then the Bible did not record his age.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Until then God did not consider that his age was worth mentioning.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He wants man to obey Him in an absolute way!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These were not the only years Abraham wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He also suffered a loss in the course of begetting a son.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God promised Abraham that he would have a son.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet he took his wife's suggestion and married Hagar as his concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He committed the sin of presumptuousness in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Later, Hagar gave birth to a son; however, this son was born out of Abraham's fleshly energy rather than out of God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the end of Genesis 16, he is spoken of as being eighty-six years old.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But at the beginning of chapter seventeen, he was ninety-nine years old.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There was a gap of thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>During those thirteen years, there is no record of anything concerning him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not see him building an altar, and God did not appear to him once.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did not receive any new revelation or promises.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Those days were empty days and days of nothingness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those were the days Ishmael grew up.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have to remember that this period of Abraham's life was wasted and lost.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brothers and sisters, have we received any new experience, new light, and new messages during the past few years?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Was anyone saved through our hands during the past few years?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Did anyone receive our help during the past few years?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Have we received a deeper knowledge of God during the past few years?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Have we gained a stronger assurance of His promises?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Have we renewed our consecration to God?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we did not have any of these experiences, our days were wasted days.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>An older sister once said, "Every single day of a Christian's life should count for a day.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the way to assure our reward."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What a pity that ten days often do not add up to one day!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brothers and sisters, it would be wonderful if we could live our Christian life in a conscientious way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we spend our days foolishly, rebelling against God, sinning, and walking according to our self-will, our days have been wasted in the eyes of the Lord; our time has been squandered away.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What a waste this is!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Why does the Bible point out that Abraham's age was ninety-nine?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is because he was circumcised in that year.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>One year after he was circumcised, he begot Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The meaning of circumcision is the removal of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we walk according to the flesh, our years are wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>May we start today by removing everything that is of the flesh and offering ourselves up fully on the altar, so that we will no longer waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should not wait for fifty years to find out that we have wasted forty-nine of them.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have to consider how many days we have wasted in foolishness and how many days we have left.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we are waiting for the Lord's coming every day, we will pay attention to the way we spend our days.</S>
