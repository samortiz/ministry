The Ten Commandments reveal God's heart and His demands. In the Ten Commandments idolatry is prohibited. What are idols? They are objects of worship outside of God. Through idolatry Israel lost its position as a nation of priests. After that, only the Levites had the position of priests. The most serious punishment is not going to hell but losing the position of priests. When God loses the priesthood, His people also lose their blessing. Canaan soon had high places, altars, and other gods, resulting in dispersion. During the great revival under Hezekiah, worship was recovered. The next revival under Nehemiah also was a revival of worship.</p><p>Not very long after Nehemiah's revival, the Lord Jesus came. Matthew 2 records the wise men coming to worship. Only those who had the eyesight could see that the small child was God. The greatest revelation of the New Testament is found in the temptation in the wilderness. It opens our eyes to see what Satan wants&mdash;the worship of man. We have what God wants and what Satan wants; what heaven wants and what hell wants. Both heaven and hell are fighting for worship.</p><p>Two thrones are now at war. What are they fighting for? They are fighting for worship. Matthew shows us in particular that Jesus is King. This is why Matthew specially speaks of those who worship Him. The Lord Jesus received what God should receive from His people. God wants to get a people who know Him and who are for Him. God wants to get a people, not just children. We must first know the Father to know God. Our beginning is a father-son relationship. Then we go on to know Him as God. The knowledge of Him as Father is a personal relationship. The knowledge of Him as God is a knowledge of His official standing in the universe. Many know the Father, but not many know God.</p><p>What is worship? It is a recognition that He is God and that we are men. We were saved when we saw He was the Father. We are finished when we see that He is God; we can only fall down and worship. It is all a matter of seeing. Worship comes from seeing; it takes revelation to worship. Praise is objective, whereas thanksgiving is subjective. When we know God, our hearts will be filled with glory. When we know the Father, our hearts are filled with joy. Glory cannot be explained; only those who see God know what glory is. Consider the experience of Mrs. Penn-Lewis. One day God revealed Himself to her. She just fell on her face. In 2 Corinthians 5:11 Paul said, "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord." God is lovable; yet He is also fearful. Those who are proud and who condemn others have not seen God. True humility comes from seeing God. The humility which comes from knowing God is unshakable. We need a new revelation of God and a deeper knowledge. If we do not have revelation and knowledge, we only have doctrines.</p><p>Two things are needed to worship&mdash;holiness and fear. "Worship Jehovah in holy splendor" (Psa. 29:2). No one who has seen God can allow sin or any unrighteousness to remain. When we go before people, our first thought is of our clothing; the same is true when we go before God. We must worship Him in holy splendor. Those who live under the glory of God say, "I am a sinner." Those who see God, fear Him. "Our God is also a consuming fire" (Heb. 12:29). Everything that can be burned, He will burn. God cannot consume those who have passed through drastic dealings by the cross. However, it is dangerous for those who do not know the work of the cross to meet God. Fire could not consume Daniel's three companions. Once a person sees God, he will spontaneously fear God.</p><p>What should we do since God wants worship and Satan wants worship? The life of God's people should be a life of worship. Every day of our life should begin with worship. Often it is necessary to kneel in prayer. God wants us to worship Him in everything. We will find that the more we worship, the more reason we will have to worship. The more we know what eternity is, the more we will worship. We should never begin anything without first worshipping God. We should first give God His portion before asking for our portion. If the church gives God His portion of worship, the result will be the establishment of God's worship on this earth. In the new heaven and new earth, all flesh will worship God. Now He does not have the worship of everything; He only has the worship of those who will worship Him. We should not look lightly upon work, prayer, etc., but we must realize that God highly esteems worship.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 46: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (6) &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
