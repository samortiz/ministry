   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT BY CARING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE FEELING OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 John 1 there is the cleansing of the blood, and in chapter 2 there is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First John 2:27 says, As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The anointing is the Holy Spirit as the oil moving and working in us Exo 30:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The living, divine anointing within us is the constant moving, working, inspiring, and enlightening of the indwelling Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to exercise our spirit, we must not only apply the blood of Christ but also take care of this anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that we must go along with the inner moving and working of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the sake of the exercise of our spirit, we need to learn the lesson of rejecting our natural mind and caring for the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is often more difficult to forget something than to remember it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a brother offends us, for example, we may remember this for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we exercise our mind in this way, we will neglect the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, we need to forsake our natural mind and care only for the moving and working of the anointing Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may further illustrate how to care for the anointing in the following way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the afternoon we may be burdened when we remember that we need to minister the word in the evening meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we may go to the Lord with the intention of praying for the meeting and the message.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, when we go to the Lord, deep within our spirit there may be a feeling, consciousness, or sense, through the moving of the Holy Spirit within us, that we should pray for something else.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If at this time we continue to pray according to our memory, we will exercise only our mind in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, we need to drop that burden, forget about the meeting and the message, and go along with the inner anointing to pray according to what we feel deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a prayer in the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all must learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must apply the blood and care for the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First John is a book concerning the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It tells us that in order to maintain the fellowship we need the cleansing of the blood on the negative side and the anointing on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only these two the cleansing and the anointing can maintain us in the proper fellowship, a fellowship not only with the Lord but also with the church and with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need always to apply the blood and to care for the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>PRAYING UNCEASINGLY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BY THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Thessalonians 5:16-22 says, Always rejoice, unceasingly pray, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not quench the Spirit; do not despise prophecies, but prove all things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hold fast to what is good; abstain from every kind of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the sequence of all the items mentioned in this passage, the focus is on praying unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not pray without ceasing, it is difficult to rejoice always.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to be continually joyful, we need to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To give thanks not only in certain things but in everything also requires that we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to pray by giving thanks to the Lord in everything and for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, in order not to quench the Spirit we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times the Spirit of prayer and intercession within us inspires us to pray, but we may be lazy and idle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not pray, we will quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By praying we are able to avoid quenching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 20 tells us not to despise prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Prophecies here are not predictions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, to prophesy is to speak for God or speak forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we pray without ceasing, we will respect the word spoken for God by any member.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Similarly, to prove all things, to hold fast to what is good, and to abstain from every kind of evil also require that we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the matters in these verses are focused on our unceasing prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 17 tells us to pray unceasingly, and 1 Timothy 2:8 tells us to pray in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To pray in every place is a matter of space, and to pray unceasingly is a matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Regarding space, we need to pray in every place, and regarding time, we need to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ephesians 6:18 says, By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These three verses tell us to pray in every place, pray unceasingly, and pray in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not pray in the spirit, we will not be able to pray in every place and unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we pray in the spirit and with the spirit, we will be able to pray wherever we are and at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While we are talking, eating, and driving, we will still be able to pray because our praying is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not Waiting but Taking the Initiative to Pray</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A certain spiritual teaching says that we should not take the initiative to pray, but rather that we must wait on the Lord until He inspires us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is right to say that we should never pray by ourselves; we must pray by the Lord in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, it is not right to say that we must wait until the Lord initiates a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, we should pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord has already taken the initiative, and now He is waiting for us to cooperate and coordinate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Wherever we are and at any time, we should not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must take the initiative to open ourselves to the Lord and coordinate with Him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we come to the meetings, we should not wait to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead, we should be prepared to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>None of the members of a basketball team wait to play after they are on the court.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the members take the initiative and begin to play.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the way we should be in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To wait is to be overly spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should immediately open our spirit and mouth to utter something from within.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The way to exercise our spirit is to learn not to wait but to open ourselves and pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may take the initiative because the Lord is already waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Psalms often tell us to wait on the Lord Psa 25:5; 27:14; 40:1; 130:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, to wait on the Lord and to wait to pray are two different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no verse that tells us to wait to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should pray in every place and at every time.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We may compare praying to driving a car.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not drive a car by taking the steering wheel and waiting for the car to start.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, everything in the car is ready, so we simply need to start it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our prayer is in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everything is ready for us to begin to pray, so there is no excuse not to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This requires much practice, but because we do not adequately practice to pray in this way, it is difficult for us to open our mouths when we come into a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The way to practice the priesthood is simply to pray at every time by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must always exercise our spirit and be ready to pray.</S>
