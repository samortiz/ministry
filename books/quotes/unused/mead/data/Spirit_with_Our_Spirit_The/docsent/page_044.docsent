   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. TO FAN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Timothy 1:6-7 indicates that we need to fan our spirit into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these verses Paul said, "For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some might think that these verses do not say that we should fan our spirit but that we should fan our gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if you get into these verses, you will see that the fanning of our gift into flame is the fanning of our spirit into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul tells us in verse 6 to "fan into flame the gift of God."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in verse 7 he says, "For God has not given us a spirit..."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our God-given spirit is what we must fan into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to fan our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to know the background of 2 Timothy to appreciate Paul's word here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul wrote this book during a difficult time for his spiritual son Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul was in prison in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, all those in Asia had forsaken Paul's ministry v. 15 . The churches in Asia were the main churches raised up through Paul's ministry, but they forsook him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Timothy was there among them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you were Timothy, how would you face the situation?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People could have said to Timothy, "Why are you still following Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the saints in Asia have forsaken him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Also, if God were really with him, He would rescue him from the prison in Rome."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No doubt, Timothy was discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, Paul would not have said, "For which cause I remind you..."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Timothy was discouraged and had to be reminded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul knew Timothy was down and he sympathized with him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He reminded Timothy that there was still a small fire within him which he needed to fan into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At times you may suffer to such an extent that you may begin to doubt God and doubt your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But regardless of how much you doubt, one thing is within you which you cannot deny your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are not like a beast.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This spirit is a trouble to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regardless of how much work Satan has done and is still doing, there is one thing within that he cannot touch our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to fan our spirit into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may say that the gift of God which we must fan into flame is a spiritual gift.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But without our spirit, how could we have the gift?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The spiritual gift is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is fire in our regenerated spirit, which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, we may say that our spirit is the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A small fire that is fanned into flame can turn into a great fire.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A forest fire is an example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The wind fans the small fire into a great fire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If something were burning within a house, and you wanted to fan that fire, you would open the window or the door.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The wind would cause the fire to burn into a flame.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The easiest way for you to fan your spirit is to open up your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you want to fan your spirit into flame, you need to open up your mouth, open up your heart, and open up your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You need to open these three layers of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You have to use your mouth to say, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But then you have to go deeper by using your mouth with your heart to say, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then you need to go even deeper by using your mouth with your heart and with your spirit to say, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is to open up your spirit from deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the fire burns.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are down, you should call, "O Lord Jesus" again and again from deep within with the exercise of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then you will be up.</S>
