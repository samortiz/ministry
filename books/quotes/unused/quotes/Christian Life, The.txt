We have to realize that in the whole universe if there is no contradiction, nothing can remain, nothing can exist
The first point is that the Christian life is the life in which the believers of Christ live Christ and magnify Christ
The Christian life is and should always be in these two aspects the individual aspect and the corporate aspect
The Bible does not arrange the truths in a certain sequence, putting the parts together to present a full and perfect picture
He was fearful that he might not magnify Christ, not make Christ larger; he could have made Christ small in the eyes of those observing him
The Godhead is the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and Christ is the center of the Divine Trinity
John 14 shows that the Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father and that the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son
Acts says that they baptized people into the name of the Lord Jesus , and Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 speak of being baptized into Christ
Christ is the eternal life, eternal in time, quality, perfection, and completion, indestructible and incorruptible
Even though we are not able to reside on this earth permanently, we already have a permanent residence in God, the eternal One
Brother Nee wrote some of these hymns, which stress that the very Christ, whom we experience today as the life that we live, is the Spirit
In the expression of Christ there is another layer of expression, that is, the expression of the processed and consummated Triune God
When the church came into existence, that indicated that God had completed His process and that He had been consummated
His work to produce the new creation began from His incarnation, and that work was consummated in His ascension
The church as the organic Body of Christ is the fullness of the Triune God, the God who has been processed and consummated
We all are a part of a local church, and every local church is a part of the universal church, which is the Body of Christ
In the church life, we live a life that is Christ Himself with His divine attributes expressed in His human virtues
The human virtues are to manifest the divine attributes, and the divine attributes are to be expressed in the human virtues
God set up Christ as His King to inherit all the nations and to possess the earth to gain a great kingdom on this earth for God's economy
The entire book of Psalms, from the first point to the last point, reveals that Christ is altogether for God's economy
To say that the Second of the Divine Trinity is realized as the Third is the ultimate understanding of the Divine Trinity
The Triune God has written a record of His own history, which we should call the autobiography of the Triune God
There is only one autobiography which speaks of God, and this autobiography is the content of the Christian life
In His resurrection He brought this humanity with Him, and He uplifted this humanity to make this humanity a divine humanity
These are the basic elements of His person, and these basic personal elements are the basic contents of the Christian life
In His process He passed through incarnation, and He also passed through a living that lasted over thirty-three years
Paul told us in Colossians 3:10-11 that there is no room for any natural person in the new man, but Christ is all and in all
Other brothers to us are Californians and in California there are the northern Californians from the Bay Area and the southern Californians
We have to add these five things together divinity, humanity, human living, the all-inclusive death, and the all-inclusive resurrection
He is also mingling Himself with us to make us exactly the same as He is in life, nature, element, and essence, but not in the Godhead
We have to see all of this; then we will have an all-inclusive view concerning the contents of the Christian life
The Triune God as the content of our Christian life comprises the divinity of God in His Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Hebrews 2:14 says that Christ's death has destroyed Satan, and John 12:31 says that His death judged the world
His resurrection produced the many sons of God to be the members which constitute the Body of Christ, the church
Acts 13:33 shows that Christ as the only begotten Son of God was reborn in resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God
1 Peter 1:3 unveils to us that we, the believers of Christ, were born in Christ's resurrection to be the many sons of God
Finally, 1 Corinthians 15:45b reveals that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit in His resurrection
Messages one hundred fiftyseven through one hundred sixtysix in the Lifestudy of Exodus cover the truth concerning the compounded ointment
All the elements plus all the numbers related to the compounded ointment signify Christs divinity humanity human life death and resurrection
The blessing of the gospel is not merely redemption, the forgiveness of sins, justification, regeneration, or salvation
We cannot say that the four spices are compounded with the olive oil because the four spices are not basic elements
Surely the city is more important because the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the divine revelation in the holy Scriptures
We saw in the previous message that the Son is the center of the Divine Trinity, expressing the Father and being realized as the Spirit
The Lord told His disciples that in His Father's house, there were many abodes and that He was going to prepare a place for them
The Lord went on to say, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
The all-inclusive Spirit is the Third of the Divine Trinity, and the Third today is the consummation of the three
The Second of the Divine Trinity in the flesh which He had put on in His incarnation became a life-giving Spirit
Our God has also been compounded with humanity and with all the elements of the process through which He passed
After His resurrection the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
The Acts and the Epistles say that the disciples baptized people into the name of the Lord Jesus and into Christ
We may insist on saying, 'Brother, we are baptizing you into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit'
The Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and is related mainly to the Lord's humanity and human living
If we want to receive the Pentecostal power, we need to go through the cross of Christ so that we can be brought into resurrection
The compound ointment has olive oil as a base compounded with four spices, myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia
The Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 are divided into two groups of five, and the ten virgins in Matthew 25 are divided into two groups of five
The Triune God today has been consummated to be such an all-inclusive Spirit with all the marvelous elements of His person and work
Brother Watchman Nee taught that we should reckon ourselves as having died with Christ in his book entitled The Normal Christian Life
Eventually, however, Brother Nee discovered that we cannot experience Christ's death in Romans 6 unless we experience the Spirit in Romans 8
In essence and existence, God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold
Many lamps today are three-way lamps, but today the all-inclusive Spirit is seven ways, that is, sevenfold intensified
The Russians who have been brought into the church life were very grateful to the saints for coming to them in the deep winter
They said that no foreigners would come to their country to carry out a project in the winter because it is too cold
We are like the 'four fingers' thinking that they can function without the 'thumb,' that is, without the Spirit
Our Savior, the crucified One, has seven eyes to express His sentiment concerning us and to infuse His love into us
We are preaching a living stone with living eyes to infuse Himself into us and to express His dear sentiment into our feeling
The Spirit of God was in Genesis 1, but in John 7:39 the Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified
The consummated Triune God and the transformed tripartite man will be married to be one heavenly, universal couple
The verses in the Scripture reading concerning the functions of the all-inclusive Spirit were selected from the entire New Testament
The first item is that God is Spirit, and the last item is that the Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God
The Lord said that when the Spirit would come, He would convict the world concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment
He told His disciples that if He did not go away, the Comforter, the Spirit of reality, would not come to them
When people listen to us, they should be convicted first concerning righteousness, second concerning sin, and third concerning judgment
The United States is like a big ocean full of all kinds of fish all kinds of people for us to catch but we do not know how to convict them
Many missionaries went to other countries for the purpose of separating people unto Christ, sanctifying them by convicting them
Eventually many in the old conservative country of China were sanctified separated from the teachings of Confucius to the gospel of Christ
While the preachers are preaching the word, the sanctifying, separating, convicting Spirit shows the hearers the beauty of Christ
Romans 12:2 charges us not to be fashioned according to this age but to be transformed by the renewing of the mind
Because we have been sealed, we bear a mark indicating that we belong to our God, that we are God's inheritance
While the gospel preaching is going on, the Spirit is always working within the listeners in the way of witnessing
Whenever a witness of Christ is speaking about Christ, another Witness, the Spirit, works to witness concerning Christ within the listeners
The witnessing Spirit with our spirit is witnessing all the time, but many Christians are not used to listening to this inward witness
The Spirit is the reality of Christ's death, the reality of Christ's resurrection, and the reality of all the divine attributes of Christ
The reality of everything that Christ is, everything that Christ has, and even everything that Christ has accomplished is the Spirit
In the previous message and in this message, we are pointing out thirty-five functions of the all-inclusive Spirit
Revelation 22 shows us the throne of God and of the Lamb with the Spirit as the river of water of life proceeding out of it
The flowing of the river quenches the thirst of the whole city, supplying the whole city with the spiritual water of life
The second verse refers to the Spirit of God, saying that the Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters
In Ephesians 3:16 Paul prayed that the Father would grant the saints 'to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man'
We may feel fatigued at a certain point in the day, but after we eat, we are nourished, strengthened, and supplied
We need to get ourselves nourished, strengthened, and supplied by eating a 'meal,' by enjoying the all-inclusive Spirit
We may not know what these gifts are, but when we come to the church meetings, we will function with a particular capacity
Fifty days before that time, on the day of resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to the disciples to breathe the Spirit into them
On the day of resurrection, He breathed the Spirit into the disciples as the pneuma, as the breath, as the Spirit of life
He wrote a book entitled Demon Possession and Allied Themes, in which he told story after story of cases involving demon possession
Most, if not all, of the teachings in Christianity today do not touch this line of the all-inclusive Spirit with His functions
As the Spirit reveals the depths of God, Christ, to us, we are renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified
The Spirit indwelling us works to apply the death of Christ as the killing element to kill all the practices of our troublesome body
In order to enjoy the application of the resurrection of Christ by the Spirit, you need to be revived every morning
To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires
The Spirit moves in one member to produce one kind of function and within another member to produce another kind of function
Every part operates in its measure, and all the joints of supply do their work as the issue of the functioning of the all-inclusive Spirit
Christ looks at us with His eyes to observe us and when He observes us He transfuses Himself into us with all of His feelings and sentiment
When we look at the Lord, allowing Him to look at us, He observes us and transfuses us with what He intends to say or to do
The consummated Spirit of God, who is the consummated God, becomes the Bridegroom to marry the bride, the church
All these verses are like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle concerning the revelation of the all-inclusive death of Christ
If we do not know the allinclusive death of Christ and if we do not experience His death in our daily life we cannot live the Christian life
We may live a life which is good in the eyes of people, but such a living has altogether nothing to do with the Christian life
After God created man, He put him in a garden before two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Hebrews 9:26 says that Christ 'has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself'
When Christ became flesh, according to Romans 8:3, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the sin of the flesh
Through Christ's crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man's flesh, into man's nature
Corinthians 15:3 says that Christ died for our sins, and Matthew 26:28 says that His blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins
When we define the death of Christ in dealing with sin, we have to cover the above three items with all the related Scripture references
Colossians 2:15 says, 'Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it'
The Roman soldiers were seen by the disciples nailing Christ's physical body to the cross where He suffered and died
In that invisible scene, Christ was stripping off the rebellious angels, the rulers and authorities in the air, coming to bother Him
The rulers and the authorities of the rebellious angels came to get that flesh, and they tried to remain on that flesh
Christ, however, overcame these rebellious angels by stripping them off and making a display of them openly in the cross
We need to see that while Christ was being crucified on the cross, He was struggling with all the evil angelic rulers and authorities
In the air, Satan has angels; on the earth, Satan has the fallen people; and in the water, Satan has the demons
He has his subordinates in the air, his subjects on the earth, and his evil servants, the demons, in the water
The apostle Peter had his natural strength and ability, and he thought he was stronger than the other disciples
Brother Watchman Nee referred to this consuming as the breaking of the outer man in his book entitled The Release of the Spirit
At the end of his ministry, Brother Nee always talked about the breaking of the outer man, which is the killing of the death of Christ
Galatians 5:24 says that they who are of Christ Jesus 'have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts'
Through Christ's death on the cross, the body of sin was annulled, or made of no effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves
Now the crucifixion of Christ has made our body of sin jobless, of no effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves
They can be one new man because Christ slew all the ordinances and crucified all the natural persons on the cross
Through His all-inclusive death, Christ slew the enmity between Israel and the Gentiles that the two might be reconciled to God in one Body
As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, whereas as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person
Today there has been much scientific study concerning food and medicine to help people to be healthy and stay healthy
Because the Word is our food and medicine, we need a scientific study of it to help us to be healthy and stay healthy in our Christian life
In this series of messages on the Christian life, we want to present all the things we have dug out of the Word in our scientific study
Anything that is related to our physical life is mysterious, but studying the things of our physical life helps us to be healthy
We want to have a scientific study of the things of the divine life so that we can be healthy in the Christian life
When He was crucified on the cross, He was stripping away all the rulers and authorities as spoken of in Colossians 2:15
In the sense of His having authority to lay His life down and to take it again Christs resurrection was His rising from the dead by Himself
Peter 3:18b says that on the one hand, He was put to death in the flesh, but on the other hand, He was made alive in the spirit
The first matter is that Christ as the last Adam, that is, as the last man in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit
According to them, to say 'the Father of eternity' is similar to saying that Edison is the father of electricity
The firstborn Son of God and the many millions of sons of God were begotten at the same time in one 'delivery'
All of the above organic items concerning the all-inclusive resurrection of Christ are mysterious and invisible, yet they are real
When we are healthy, our organic, physical life is active and working all day long, but we are not aware of its working
My burden is not to teach theology or biblical doctrines, but to minister the healthy teaching concerning the real Christian life
With them, however, the inner life was too mysterious and became a difficult thing for people to enter into and apprehend
In the eighteenth century, William Law, a British scholar, improved the writings of the mystics, and this became a help to others
Some portions concerning the cross in Brother Watchman Nee's book The Spiritual Man mostly were translated from Mrs
Because the Spirit is abstract and mysterious, many disregard and neglect the truth concerning the Spirit and the experience of the Spirit
By this we can see that the bona fide, fundamental, real seekers of Christ all have problems related to the Spirit
The divisive factor among the fundamental, spiritual, and seeking Christians is not mainly related to doctrines
The divisive factor is nearly altogether due to the apprehension, comprehension, and realization of the Spirit
The New Testament economy was initiated by the conception of John the Baptist and the conception of the Lord Jesus
The Holy Spirit concerns the initiation of God's New Testament economy related to the conceptions of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus
When Christ came out to minister, the Bible tells us that before His resurrection, His glorification, 'the Spirit was not yet'
The Lord said that He would ask the Father to send the disciples another Comforter, who is the Spirit of reality
In the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came back to the disciples, breathed into them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Jesus' body of flesh before His resurrection was not glorious, divine, spiritual, attractive, marvelous, splendorous, majestic, or excellent
Rather, according to Isaiah 53, Jesus was a person who was very lowly, with no attractiveness, no beauty, no comeliness
In His human living, He lived in Nazareth in a carpenter's home for thirty years, and He ministered for three and a half years
Christ in His incarnation brought God into humanity, and in His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity
In reference to the resurrection of Christ, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
After His resurrection, Acts 16:7b speaks of the Spirit of Jesus, and Romans 8:9 speaks of the Spirit of Christ
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is 'the Spirit' mentioned in John 7:39, the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ
The burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering are types
The one hin of olive oil is the base of the compound ointment and this oil is compounded with four spices myrrh cinnamon calamus and cassia
His divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, and wonderful resurrection are compounded in the Spirit
The second unit of five hundred shekels being split typifies Christ as the Second of the Divine Trinity who was split crucified on the cross
The one thumb may be compared to the one hin of olive oil, and the four fingers may be compared to the four spices of the compound ointment
When God, pictured by our thumb, is added to us human beings, pictured by our four fingers, we are able to bear responsibility
Man needs God added to his being, just as the four fingers need the thumb added to them so that the hand can bear responsibility
When we are under the anointing of the Spirit, we can fulfill our duty to bear responsibility for the Lord's interest
After regeneration, we pass through the steps of sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and eventually glorification
The New Testament reveals clearly and emphasizes very strongly that such a consummated Spirit is right in our spirit
The spirit referred to in Romans 8 is actually a mingled spirit, the compound Spirit mingled with our human spirit
If we do not understand the significances of that human image, we cannot understand human government in the biblical sense
The significance of the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30 is greater than the creation of the universe
The anointing is the working, moving, acting, and speaking of the ointment, and the ointment is the consummation of our Triune God
The Christian life is the acting, moving, working, and speaking of the consummated God who is typified by the compound ointment
We have been forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God through His death so that we could be regenerated to be sons of God
Christ's resurrection is so powerful, especially in the sense of resisting and repelling the enemy and all the negative things
Christ's resurrection resists all the opposition and attacks from the enemy, and it repels all the evil 'insects' and 'snakes'
Christ's resurrection is repelling all the demons, evil spirits, and especially their leading one, the snake, the old serpent, the devil
We saw in the previous message that Christ, His death, and His resurrection are compounded together in the Spirit
The Bible shows us that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God and that They are eternally coexistent
The issue of this blending is a man in the universe who is the mingling of God with man, and His name is Jesus
The first item in the history of the universe is God; the second item is the created universe, and the third item is man
Isaiah 11:1 says, 'Then a twig will come forth from the stem of Jesse,/And a branch from his roots will bear fruit'
The seventh major item in the history of the universe is that in and through His resurrection, Christ became a life-giving Spirit
We have seen in the previous message that the life-giving Spirit is a compound, as typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25
The lifegiving Spirit has been compounded with God as the base typified by the one hin of olive oil and with man typified by the four spices
In this compound there is the death of Christ, signified by myrrh, and the resurrection of Christ, signified by calamus
When the husbands are about to argue with their wives, they may experience something within urging them to stop
The only way to exalt Christ, express Christ, manifest Christ, and live Christ is to live, to walk, and to do things according to the spirit
When we live and walk by the Spirit, the Spirit becomes a killing to our soul, our natural man, and our body with its practices
The issue of our enjoyment of the compound Spirit first is the church and consummately will be the New Jerusalem
Christ's death and its effectiveness, with which the Spirit has been compounded, become prevailing in the Spirit
That moving is the anointing and that anointing is the dispensing of the Triune God of the death of Christ and of the resurrection of Christ
It is under this dispensing, this anointing, this moving of the indwelling Spirit, that we experience the death of Christ
Paul said that he was bearing about in his body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus might be manifested in his body
We have the indwelling Spirit within us but because we are sometimes stiffnecked and stubborn God raises up the environment to deal with us
In every part of our being, we must be willing to cooperate with the indwelling Spirit and to accept the outward environment
The longer we stay in the church, the more we experience the killing, the working of death, the working of the cross
We need to remain under the killing, the working of death, the working of the cross, that we may live in resurrection
God passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
The reality of the Bible is the Spirit as the consummation of resurrection, and resurrection is the embodiment of the processed God
If we do not realize that the Spirit is the resurrection, we cannot have the adequate experience of the Spirit
As long as we experience resurrection, that is the real experience of the Spirit, both essentially and economically
Christ breathed the Spirit into the disciples , and He poured out the Spirit upon the disciples fifty days later
God is the resurrection, the resurrection is the compound Spirit, and the compound Spirit is the consummated God
We are not able to understand such a deep and high mystery, the mystery of resurrection, but we can experience resurrection
When we eat food, we take in many nourishing elements and vitamins which we do not understand, yet we can enjoy them
When resurrection functions in us, we are full of joy, full of peace, full of rest, full of praising, and full of rejoicing
When we are experiencing the Spirit as resurrection, all the negative things are on the cross, in the tomb, and under our feet
To experience the Spirit as the reality of resurrection, we need to turn to our spirit to pray, praise, sing, or talk to God
The more we die the more the divine attributes such as peace joy light life and love will be with us to be the content of our human virtues
We need to be people who are occupied with the Triune God, with the consummated Spirit, and with the resurrection
Christ's resurrection with its power in the life-giving Spirit is the sufficient grace of the processed and consummated Triune God
We may also say that the Spirit as the realization of Christ's resurrection and its power is the sufficient grace
The consummated God, the resurrection, and the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit are our portion in the divine fellowship
That ointment was not made of only a single ingredient olive oil but was made of olive oil compounded with four kinds of spices
Romans 1:17 and Galatians 3:11, which are quoted from Habakkuk 2:4, say that the righteous 'shall have life and live by faith'
These two spirits the divine Spirit and the human spirit are mingled within us; hence, we call this spirit 'the mingled spirit'
It is difficult to decide whether our walk should be according to the divine Spirit or according to the human spirit
We should not think that if we are humble, gentle, kind, and tolerant, we are holy and are living the Christian life
If we are quiet by the Spirit, we will not be like a dead person buried in a tomb; on the contrary, we will be very active and very living
In our hesitation, we need to consider how to answer in such a way that we exercise ourselves unto godliness, unto the manifestation of God
Prayer slows us down because to pray is to exercise our spirit, and that spontaneously puts aside our emotion, our will, and our mind
My burden is to help the saints to understand what Paul wrote in Galatians 5:16 and 25 concerning living and walking by the Spirit
To speak of living by Christ as our life may be somewhat abstract, but to speak of living by Christ as our person is more definite
Whether we live by Christ as our life or not is difficult to know, but whether we live by Christ as our person or not is very clear
Before His incarnation He was God as the Spirit already, but the Spirit in the stage before incarnation was not the life-giving Spirit
In the living of some saints it may be difficult to discern whether they themselves are expressed or whether God is manifested
In contrast, it is easier to discern whether a person who is very active and makes many mistakes is living Christ or living himself
The first word, used in Galatians 5:16a, denotes the general walk in our daily life, implying a common, habitual daily walk
The first kind of walk is the daily walk for our daily living, and the second is a walk according to rules for the church
One aspect is the Christian daily life, the normal, habitual, common living in our daily life, with no particular goal or purpose in view
Every person must live two kinds of lives, one for his ordinary daily life and another for his job, for his purpose, his goal
People may know us also as those who attend the church meetings on the Lord's Day morning and on other nights of the week
In Galatians 6:15-16 Paul said, 'For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters
To live a new creation by walking according to the rule of the new creation is the second kind of walk, the walk by rules
We have been regenerated to be a new creation ; hence, we must walk by the rule, by the regulation, of a new creation
Because we are a new creation, and because we have a goal, a purpose, there are certain things that we would not do
If we are a loose person, a busybody who gossips all the time, we will not be able to live a life that is for the church
To walk by the Spirit is to walk in Christ's resurrection, through His crucifixion, and by the compound Spirit
If you are not crossed out, even if you feel that you are full of the Spirit, you should not do or say anything
When we take Christ's crucifixion, instantly we are in resurrection, and the reality of resurrection is the Spirit
To live and walk by the Spirit is to walk in Christ's resurrection, through His crucifixion, and by the compound Spirit
The crucifixion of the Lord on the cross has two significant aspects the objective aspect and the subjective aspect
Some unbelieving Jewish scholars would say that a martyr by the name of Jesus died on the cross for his religious teachings
They would say that he was martyred on the cross by the Jewish religionists through the hands of the Roman government
Many believers of Christ are shallow and superficial, and in their spiritual understanding they are just at the threshold of God's economy
Corinthians 15:3 says that the first thing Paul delivered to the saints in the gospel was that Christ died for our sins
If we are to be those who live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ, we need a deeper understanding of Christ's death
Bone of my bones' indicates that we, the members of the church as the Body of Christ, are parts of the resurrected Christ
He died on the cross not only for objective redemption but also for subjective union, subjective identification
The book Bone of His Bone says that the Christian life is not an imitation of Christ but a participation of Christ
Even the word identification is not fully adequate, because it does not convey the full thought of the divine economy
Fleshy denotes being made of flesh; fleshly denotes being influenced by the nature of the flesh and partaking of the character of the flesh
The apostle considered the Corinthian believers to be totally of the flesh, to be made of the flesh, and to be just the flesh
In Genesis 315 God promised fallen man that He would come as the seed of the woman indicating His incarnation but He did not come right away
From Adam to Abraham, there were two thousand years; and from Abraham to Christ, there were another two thousand years
For God to fully accomplish His union with man, He had to pass through human living, pass through death, and enter into resurrection
The New Testament tells us that when He died on the cross, He died with us , because He died on the cross in the flesh, and we are the flesh
Before His incarnation, He was like a bird soaring everywhere in the air, but through His incarnation, He entered into a cage
In Christian theology, this is known as identification, but in our teaching, we do not usually use the term identification
When we are buried in the water of John's ministry, this indicates that we realize that we are good for nothing but death
When people came to John to repent, John threw them into the water to bury them, to end them, to terminate them
When a sinner repents to God, he should repent to such an extent that he realizes he is good for nothing but death
Paul tells us clearly in Romans 6:4 and Colossians 2:12 that in baptism we are buried together with Christ into His death
On the one hand, Paul had been terminated, but on the other hand, a resurrected Paul, one who had been regenerated, still lived
In the medical field, a doctor will give someone an injection at a spot on their body for the benefit of their entire body
The doctor injects only one spot, but this one spot represents the entire body, so the entire body receives the injection
The writer of Born Crucified also told a story about an old missionary who had lived a defeated Christian life
The book says that though he was a solid Presbyterian, he was jumping around his table with joy, saying, 'Christ liveth in me!
There are a number of people in Christianity who teach that the three of the Divine Trinity are three separate persons
There is no separation among the three, but there is a distinction among the Father and the Son and the Spirit
The New Testament says in 1 Corinthians 15:45b that the last Adam, who came to be our Substitute, became a life-giving Spirit
In Him we have God the uplifted humanity Christs death the effectiveness of His death Christs resurrection and the power of His resurrection
We have to realize that in this pneumatic Christ the lifegiving Spirit the compound Spirit the death of Christ is available to us every day
We want to expound all these things so that we would realize that the Spirit whom we are enjoying every day is a compound Spirit
When we drink the tea, we receive the elements of lemon, tea, and water since they have been compounded together
In the next message, we will continue our fellowship on our need to live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ
The term regenerated crucified may seem strange, because the two words regenerate and crucify have opposite denotations
Paul's boasting concerning his own righteousness is similar to David's boasting of his integrity in the Psalms
In verse 9 he said that he was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived and he died
To bear the cross means, first, that Christ has brought us to the cross and, second, that we were crucified with Him on the cross
After much growth in the Lord the more you followed the Lord Jesus the more you received the answer no when you sought the Lords permission
You might ask the Lord if you can go to sleep, but deep within you know that what the Lord wants you to do is to kneel down and pray
The first stanza of Hymns 622 says that the meaning of the cross is not to suffer rather the meaning of the cross is to terminate our self
If we still live in our flesh, we must die, but if we bear the cross by dying throughout the day, we will live
The Christian life is a life of dying and living, a life in which the natural man dies and God lives in the resurrected man
If all the members of the church are dying and sleeping in their tomb, there will be no problems in the church life
To bear the cross is to deal with us, the person the Chinese person, the Mexican person, the American person, the German person
Many believers, after being saved for ten or twenty years, have never allowed their being to be touched by the Lord
There is very little opportunity for the Lord to add Himself into us, and consequently there is very little growth in life
He corrupted their soul, their mind; then their taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge corrupted their body
The best way to preach the gospel is to stir up people's conscience so that they realize that they are sinful before God
It is possible for a person to commit suicide by many means but no one can commit suicide by crucifixion because no one can crucify himself
Galatians 5:24 says, 'But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts'
Although we cannot crucify ourselves, we can crucify our flesh, our fallen body, with its passions and its lusts
In Romans 6:6 Paul wrote, 'Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled '
Our victory over sin is not that we are able to conquer sin; our victory over sin is in our remaining under the cross
Paul's word in Galatians 5:24 indicates that within our fallen flesh, which is the body of sin, there are two categories of things
We must crucify our flesh with its passions and its lusts, which means that we must put all the practices of the body to death
The consummated God lives in us as the Spirit, and we have an organ, our spirit, that was preserved and is even indwelt by God
Every day we need to exercise our spirit with the help of the indwelling Spirit to put every part of our flesh to death
In message twelve we saw that we were regenerated crucified, born crucified , and that now we are dying to live
In this message we want to see something further concerning our need to live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ
Within this compound Spirit as a big dose there is the element of Christs death which is active in killing all the negative things within us
The wives, the husbands, the children, the brothers, and everything in our environment are used by the Lord as knives to kill us
If the Christian life were merely a happy life, the apostle Paul would not have needed to charge us to rejoice
When we are willing to suffer and be killed, we live Christ, we magnify Christ, and Christ is manifested in us
We may feel that no one would want to believe in the Lord Jesus if they realized that the Christian life is a life under such a killing
Every day we are under the killing of Christ's death that His life may be manifested in our body in the renewing of our inner man
In this message we want to conclude our fellowship on our need to live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ
She said that she had dedicated her time to study the Bible with the help of the Life-studies and the books we have published
Since she gave herself to the Lord in this way, she wondered why the Lord did not do anything for her and why the Lord would not protect her
She pointed out that in one of Brother Nee's books, he said that the Lord does not care whether we are successful or mistaken
She said that she had been dedicating herself and her time to reading the Bible and the publications of the ministry every day
Brother Nee was absolutely right in saying that God does not care whether we are successful or whether we are mistaken
All who are in His kingdom must be those who give God the full ground and the full opportunity to work Himself into them
If we love God, He will cause all things to work together for our good, but the good is not what we may want or expect
When a person loses money, he may complain to God, but God is taking this opportunity to dispense Himself into this person
Especially, we should not tell Him to deal with our enemies, because this is against the teaching of the New Testament
David disguised himself to make Abimelech think that he was insane, and then he blessed and praised God for delivering him
Often God will not do anything for us according to our concept, and it may seem to us that God is not faithful
We may pray day and night and put our trust in the Lord, but eventually nothing comes out according to our earnest prayer
If we entrust our money to such persons and lose our money, how can we blame the Lord for not answering us and not doing anything for us?
The Lord said that we cannot serve God and mammon and that if we seek God and His kingdom, God will care for our needs
Later when the Lord was on the cross He saw His mother and His disciple John standing by and He said to His mother Woman behold your son
For Him to be hanging on the cross and tell His mother not to look at Him but to look at John as her son was a death to the natural life
She eventually should be able to declare to the universe that even though she does not have any savings, she is still living
On the one hand, we parents surely love our children, but on the other hand, our children cause us much trouble
The Lord uses all things, both the things in the 'day' and the things in the 'night,' to transform us and conform us to His image
Only the Lord knows the heavenly, spiritual mathematics concerning what in our environment works the best for our good
Paul was a person who was conformed to the death of Christ by something mysterious called the power of resurrection
Eventually, we will learn that whether money comes or money goes, whether children come or children go, God remains
After we have been under God's dealing for some time, we are so willing to be conformed to Christ's death in everything
We want to be conformed to the death of Christ, and we can be such persons only by the hidden power of resurrection
He even enumerated to God all the afflictions and mistreatment he suffered from his enemies and asked God to deal with them
If we would go to the Lord to tell Him all the mistreatment we suffered from our enemies, we would become dead inside
We have to follow the Lord's word where He said, 'You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy'
To live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ is to be conformed to Christ's death by the mysterious power of resurrection
If we check with our experience, we will realize that at times we are the new man, and at other times we are the old man
After our morning revival we are the new man, but a short time later we may be offended by someone and become the old man
If the mold is in the image of a fish, the dough that is pressed into this mold will be conformed to the shape of a fish
On the one hand, we are happy in the recovery and in the church life, but on the other hand, deep within we are suffering here
According to Romans 8:13, we are conformed to the death of Christ through our putting to death the practices of our body by the Spirit
These practices include not only sinful things but also all things practiced by our body apart from the Spirit
On the one hand, we must take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body; the Spirit does not do it for us
On the other hand, we should not attempt to deal with our body by relying on our own effort without the power of the Holy Spirit
The putting to death of Jesus refers to the working of death, the working of the cross, which the Lord Jesus suffered and went through
The life of Jesus here is the resurrection life, which the Lord Jesus lived and expressed through the working of the cross
Although Mary, His mother, was very spiritual and knew the Scriptures very well , at times even she troubled the Lord Jesus
Through this we can see that every day and even every minute of those thirty-three and a half years, Christ was dying
Because some of the saints were closely related to the divisive ones, their carrying out of this kind of quarantining is a suffering to them
John 10 says that we should not even greet those who are heretical in the teaching concerning Christ's divine person
Because of their close relationship with the divisive ones in the recovery, some of the saints have said that they cannot quarantine them
If we do not quarantine them, we will not be doing the will of God, for we will annul the testimony of the oneness of the Body
The second reason for Christ's death is that He had to deny His human life in order to live by the Father's life
When He was on the earth He did not live by His human life; rather, He denied His human life to live by the Father's divine life
In every situation related to our daily living, we need to ask ourselves whether we are living by the divine life or by our natural life
We are those who have been saved, regenerated, and separated to live not by our natural life but by the divine life
In this message we want to see that the Christian life is the living of the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit in the believers
If we know God only in an objective way, we will not know that God is the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit
The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit passed through the processes of incarnation and human living
If He had not died for our sins on the cross, how could God be our Father and how could the Spirit come to dwell in us?
On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He breathed into the believers and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
He dispensed Himself as the Spirit into them after being processed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection
Before Jesus' glorification in His resurrection , the Spirit was not yet, that is, He was not yet consummated, not yet completed
The Spirit of Jehovah is a particular expression, a particular divine title, ascribed to God in His relationship with man
After Christ's incarnation, God sanctifies us, separates us, by coming into us and by bringing us into Him to mingle us together with Him
The Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who separates us unto God, becoming the Spirit of the incarnated Jesus
The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of the Man Jesus with humanity that we may live the proper human life and endure its sufferings
By the Spirit of Christ, we partake of His resurrection life, His resurrection power, His transcendency, and His reigning authority
In his suffering the apostle Paul experienced both the Lord's suffering in His humanity and the Lord's resurrection
The Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God
The one hin of olive oil also signifies the unique God, and the four spices of the plant life signify man, the creature of God
It was with the compound ointment that the tabernacle and all its utensils and Aaron and all the priests were anointed
The Spirit is the consummated Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God as the consummation of the Triune God
After Christ's resurrection, the Spirit of God became 'the Spirit,' the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ
The spirit here refers to the mingled spirit, which is the divine Spirit and our human spirit mingled together as one spirit
The consummated Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God indwells and has been mingled with our spirit
