TO HAVE A LIVING OF BEARING FRUIT</h2>
<p>We do not need to make up our mind to endeavor to bring someone to the Lord each year. This is not what we are saying. Rather, we should all have a proper Christian life, a life with no distractions, frustrations, or addictions. We should pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! By Your mercy and through Your grace I am here absolutely for You. I have no desire, likes, dislikes, addictions, or frustrations. I have nothing but You, Lord. If you give me something, I will take it, but if You do not give it to me, I do not desire it. I do not care for long hair or short hair. Because I am a human, I need something to cover me, and I do not desire to give people the impression that I am sloppy. However, I do not love my coat and tie. Likewise, I shave every morning because I wish to be a right person and not give people a wrong impression, but I do not love shaving or not shaving. I do not love anything, Lord. I love only You, and if I love something else, prune it off.&rdquo; If we pray in this way, we will be refreshed, and we will have a life that produces fruit. It is not by our endeavoring, doing, willing, or making up our mind to bring people to the Lord. That will not work, and even if it did work, we would bring forth fruit only according to what we are in ourselves. We need to be pruned by the Lord. This is a serious matter. We are not a &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; people, like the Amish who are allowed to wear only certain colors. We simply desire to have a proper Christian life.</p>
<p>More than forty years ago, when I was in Shanghai, a group of young missionaries went to China with the China Inland Mission, many of whom were sisters. Certain older sisters who had been in Shanghai for a while had learned what a Western missionary needed to do to convince the conservative Chinese people. The newer, younger sisters, however, arrived from England wearing their skirts only a little below the knee. In those days that was considered a very modern style, and some even considered it to be sinful. There was a certain older sister who loved the Lord and had been working in China for many years. She realized that all these young British missionaries with short skirts could never be fruitful. The stubborn, conservative Chinese people would say, &ldquo;What is this? You are immoral. Why should we listen to you?&rdquo; However, she dared not say anything to them. Instead, she served tea to them every afternoon. Then while the young sisters sat around her, enjoying their tea, she would adjust her own longer skirt. The young sisters watched her do this, and then they looked at their own bare legs. This caused them to be bothered within. Since all those young missionaries loved the Lord, they were convinced. The Lord touched them, and they dealt with Him about their dress. If they had not done this, they may not have had the peace to pray. If they had said, &ldquo;Lord, save the Chinese people,&rdquo; the Lord might have said, &ldquo;Let me save you first. Then I will answer your prayer for China.&rdquo; This was not simply a matter of an outward change; it was an inward touching by the Lord. In this way their preaching of the gospel to the Chinese people became a living, not merely a work.</p>
<p>To make our preaching a work is poor. We are not carrying out a job in our preaching; we are living a life. Therefore, if anything hinders us in our fellowship with the Lord, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, prune this. I give You the freedom to cut it.&rdquo; This is what is meant by the Lord&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;Every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.&rdquo; In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not practice to have regulations. According to my own conscience, I could not smoke a cigarette and then partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table. However, we have never passed a regulation against smoking. We do not believe in regulations, but neither do we believe that those who smoke are able to have the best remembrance of the Lord at His table. Likewise, we cannot believe that those who love shopping can have the overflow of the inner life to bring forth fruit. Therefore, we do not wish to encourage, charge, or stir up anyone to have a mere gospel preaching work. Instead, what we need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is for many dear saints who love the Lord and mean business with Him to constantly be one with Him. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am one with You in my shopping. Whatever You do not want to buy, I also do not want to buy it. If You want to buy something, I will buy it only because You are buying it.&rdquo; We may also say, &ldquo;Lord, I do not care for short hair, long hair, a beard, or no beard. I care only for You and for what You want. In my whole life, as one saved by You and under Your transformation, I like nothing and I dislike nothing. I have no love for anything else. My love is only for You. I want You to prune everything that is not Yourself.&rdquo; If we always remain in this condition, we will be the pruned branches.</p>
<p>A pruned branch always has fresh, new, tender shoots that bring forth fruit. Those who keep vineyards know that the branches of the vines bring forth fruit only at the fresh shoots. We all need to have &ldquo;fresh shoots.&rdquo; If the sisters who love to have many pairs of shoes would say, &ldquo;Lord, prune me in this matter,&rdquo; and they allow the Lord to do it, they will have a new &ldquo;shoot&rdquo; full of freshness, newness, and tenderness, and a good cluster of grapes will be brought forth. There is no need to say that we must deal with sinful matters. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we all hate anything sinful. However, there are many other items which are not sinful that we still hold on to. These matters deaden us even though we still endeavor to preach the gospel and bring people to the Lord. The Lord will not honor this kind of endeavoring very much. This is why we all need to go to the Lord, not to will or to make up our mind but to have a thorough dealing. We must lay ourselves on the altar and say, &ldquo;Lord, strip off my covering, cut me, and shine upon me. Expose me, and show me the true situation with my likes and dislikes.&rdquo; Then if we go along with the Lord&rsquo;s exposing and enlightening, and we have a thorough dealing with Him, we will be fruitful.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
