<h2 class="head1">THE GROUND AND THE COORDINATION<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the ground and coordination of the church and concerning the law of revival. The brothers who visited various places in Southeast Asia observed various problems mainly related to the ground of the church and the coordination in service. The young brothers and sisters who answer the Lord&rsquo;s call need to have a broad understanding concerning the situation of Christianity and concerning the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in raising us up. We would like to present a general sketch of the Lord&rsquo;s purpose. This matter determines whether or not we will take this way in the future.</p>
<p>The difficulties, attacks, and ordeals that we have suffered for the past thirty years in the East were related mainly to the matters of the ground of the church and coordination. It has been forty years since our senior co-worker, Watchman Nee, was raised up by the Lord. Shortly after he began his ministry, he received a vision from the Lord. He gave me this vision. In this regard, I am a person who has received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. After my salvation, I was drawn by the Lord to love Him and pursue Him; I was willing to forsake everything for Him. However, before I began to fellowship with Brother Nee, I did not have a vision. I simply loved the Lord and felt His presence.</p>
<p>In 1933 I was drawn by the Lord to drop my job. I can testify that I was filled with the Spirit and was able to affect others, but I did not have a vision. Brother Nee gave me a strong confirmation concerning dropping my job. Hence, as soon as I left my job, I had the feeling that I must go to Shanghai and fellowship with Brother Nee.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing That Christ Is Everything and<br />
That He Is Our Life</h2>
<p>I left Chefoo and traveled through Tientsin, Beijing, and Nanking. Finally I arrived in Shanghai in order to fellowship with Brother Nee. The first impression I received was that Christ is everything and that He wants to be our life. Brother Nee opened my eyes to see these truths. I received much help during my first visit to Shanghai. The value of the help Brother Nee gave me can be measured only in eternity. Brother Nee was systematic in the way that he rendered help. By such leading, the Lord revealed Himself to me step by step. I was in Shanghai for less than two months, but I became very clear concerning the vision of Christ being everything and being my life. My visit to Shanghai was at the end of 1933 and the beginning of 1934.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing the Death and Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>One time I went to Brother Nee&rsquo;s home, and we sat together and talked. I still remember our talk that day. He said, &ldquo;Brother, all of our spiritual experiences are, objectively speaking, Christ Himself, but subjectively speaking, we experience His death and resurrection.&rdquo; This word opened up a vision to me. Objectively, Christ is everything, and He is our life. This is a vision; it is theory. Subjectively, we experience His death and resurrection. This is practical. Brother Nee added a few words. He said that everything of the old creation, everything natural, that is, not only the evil things but also the good things, must be terminated on the cross. This is reality. Only in resurrection can we enter into everything that is in Christ and everything that is spiritual. We experience the experiences of Christ. Without Christ, that is, apart from Christ, all that we are and do are not only zero in God&rsquo;s eyes but also incur His condemnation. No matter how well we serve, everything we do that is outside of Christ is a problem and will be condemned. Everything must be in Christ, and everything must be Christ. He also said that in order for everything to be in Christ and to be Christ, we must experience death and resurrection. Only in death and resurrection can we experience Christ. His words were crucial to me. I am continually understanding and experiencing this fellowship.</p>
<p>From the end of 1933 until 1940, I lived in the vision of Christ being my life and in the experience of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In other words, I lived in the vista that Brother Nee opened up to me. During this period of time, I also spoke concerning the church, concerning religious organizations, and concerning the center of our worshipping God. Not much of what I spoke during those years is in print. There is only a little booklet entitled <em>The Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.</em> The content of this booklet is taken from the beginning of the New Testament. It is to help young believers in their Bible reading.</p>
