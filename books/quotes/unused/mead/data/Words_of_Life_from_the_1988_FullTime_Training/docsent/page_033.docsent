   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN A WORD OF CHARGE 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 1:15; 4:10, 14; 2 Cor 6:8; 4:11; 1 Cor 16:9; Phil 2:19-22; Rev 2:4, 5, 7; Matt 10:24; 1 Tim 6:12; 2 Tim 4:1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following the last fellowship, I have some more unfinished words within me for you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>STORMS BEING OFTEN IN THE WAY OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To begin with, I would like to tell all the trainees, and especially the young brothers and sisters, that man generally has a wrong concept about the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He thinks that all works that are of the Lord will definitely prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This thought indeed has scriptural support, and in many cases it is indeed so.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, it does not mean that there will be no problem or attack in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us first see the Lord Jesus example.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was God; yet He became a man and lived on earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He was thirty years of age, He came out to fulfill His ministry and to do God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, we do see success with Him, but it was not always sunshine without clouds or storms, as most people think.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once He and the disciples got on a boat, and He said to His disciples, Let us go over to the other side of the lake; and they launched out Luke 8:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A short time later, a storm came with winds and waves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know that there were fallen angels in the winds and evil spirits in the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fallen angels in the air and evil spirits in the water worked together to prevent the Lord from going across.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was only a short journey, but the storm was quite fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Concerning the Lord s work during His thirty-three and a half years on earth, there were indeed successes, but there were often winds and waves as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was hardly a place where there was no storm, and there was hardly a step taken without encountering resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Pharisees were always following Jesus closely, seeking to ensnare Him in His talk and even to conspire against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, He was betrayed by Judas, one of the twelve disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was handed over to be judged, scourged, mocked, and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was on the cross, people still jeered at Him, saying, If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross! and again, He saved others; himself he cannot save!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matt 27:40, 42 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From man s point of view, He failed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, He was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through death He destroyed the Devil, who had the might of death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, He resurrected from the dead, overcoming death and Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE APOSTLES ALSO</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>MEETING PERSECUTION AND AFFLICTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the Lord resurrected and ascended, the apostles continued His ministry and propagated God s work on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They won the first battle on the first day, the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As soon as Peter started preaching the gospel, three thousand were saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From that day, the Lord added daily those who should be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, the preaching of the apostles was not without difficulties or resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, James was martyred, and Peter was imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Paul came, not only did he suffer much outward affliction and persecution, but he encountered troubles among his co-workers as well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we have seen, first there was Barnabas, who disputed with Paul and left because of personal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then there was Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul advised him to go to Corinth to help when Paul was bearing the burden of the problem in Corinth, yet he absolutely would not go.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Finally, in Paul s last Epistle, 2 Timothy, he said that all in Asia had left him and his ministry 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Among those who left Paul was the church in Ephesus, where Paul had worked for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to him 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His co-worker Demas loved the world and left him as well 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul s life-long service, just as he said himself, was of glory and dishonor, of evil and good report 2 Cor 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was always in the triumphant procession of Christ, spreading the fragrance of Christ everywhere 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was also often delivered unto death and became the ambassador in a chain 4:11; Eph 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When he was in Ephesus, a great and effective door was opened to him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, there were many opposers also 1 Cor 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In his last trip, he was transferred from Jerusalem to Rome as a prisoner.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While he was expecting to be martyred for his Master, he wrote 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From man s viewpoint, he was martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From God s viewpoint, he was offered to God as a drink offering 4:6 .</S>
