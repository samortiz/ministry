   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Submission to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Submission to the Head</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Authority is the deputy of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the eyes see, it is actually not the eyes that are seeing, but the head that sees.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the limbs move, they are not the ones that are moving, but it is the head that is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the movements of the body are headed up by the head.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ministry is the movement of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we are at odds with the ministry, we are at odds with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible, the overwhelming majority of authorities are deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we speak about submission to authority, we mean submission to deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The real manifestation of authority is the expression of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To submit to authority is to submit to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, God's children ought to learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Accepting the Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather Than Repeating the Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ministry is expressed in two things: gift and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gift is the power of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is also the expression of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A man cannot accept the gift while rejecting the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, on the one hand, the eyes have the gift of seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the other hand, they have the authority, and other members have to accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If other members do not accept the eyes, they will not receive the supply of their gift.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as you are a member of the Body, you have to accept the gifts of the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need for you to repeat their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning the ministry, there is only the question of accepting; there is no need of repeating.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we have to do today is not a matter of repeating others' ministries, like copying writing with carbon paper.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All we have to do is to accept.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Always remember that you are only a member; you are not the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a person is all-inclusive, he is no longer a member.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The parts of a car are only the parts; they are not the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The parts cannot equal the whole car.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every Member</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Enjoying the Riches of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although I am only a member, I can share the riches of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every member in the Body shares the riches of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My fingers never complain that they cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My ears never complain that they cannot walk.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They never say, "How come I cannot walk as the feet do?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The many gifts in the Body are there to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why there is no division in the Body, and there are no conflicting ideologies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the position of the hand dictates that it cannot be the speaking member, as long as the mouth can speak, the hand is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For the mouth to speak is the same as for the hand to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The life that we received is a partial life; it is not the whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we experience the riches of the other members in this way, the Body is perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Under such circumstances, how can the individual members be poor, and how can they be useless?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Coordination Dealing with the Self</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people think that what they have is their own, and that what others have is not theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, we have to realize that individualism is the worst thing there is in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Body of Christ, individualism must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The greatest test to the self is in the meetings, in the church, and among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, we have to see that we are members individually.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the other hand, we have to see that we are a Body together with many other members.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is easy to deal with unbelievers; the minute they walk through the door, they will realize that they have the wrong address and have stumbled into the wrong place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But it is not so easy to deal with individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times, individualism creeps into the church without one realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is when a person is being coordinated together that his self life is most severely dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The minute a man lives in coordination, his self is dealt with.</S>
