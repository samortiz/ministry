<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE PRACTICE<br />
OF GROUP MEETINGS</h1>
<p>This morning we will study the way to take care of small groups. Since October of 1984 when we first mentioned the change of the system, we have been practicing small group meetings here in Taipei. At that time, we had a slogan: &ldquo;The heaven can be annulled, and the earth can pass away, but the small group meeting must not be forsaken.&rdquo; Afterwards, we were divided into four hundred small groups, and the number of attendants was between three thousand and thirty-five hundred. After promoting these groups for more than a year, from 1985 to the spring of 1986, the number of attendants in the small group meetings rose to over five thousand. From this we can see the effectiveness of small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BRINGING THE NEW ONES<br />
TO THE EXISTING SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>In the second half of 1986, we began to conduct formal trainings, and we tried our best to bring the local saints into those trainings. At that time there were over a thousand saints who had attended the evening trainings at various times. Most of these were the nucleus of the church in Taipei. The four hundred small groups were on their shoulders. As soon as they came forward to attend the training, the small groups were left untended. As a result, during the last year, although the small groups still existed, they were in a situation where they were left to themselves.</p>
<p>In spite of this, these first small groups are still a foundation. They are still quite useful. At present in the church in Taipei there are about thirty-five hundred saints who attend meetings regularly in the halls. The number of those who were brought in through gospel preaching by door-knocking in the communities and who have meetings every week is about two thousand. The two groups comprise more than six thousand people. It is not much of a problem for those who have been meeting in the halls to come to the group meetings or district meetings, because they are accustomed to them already. However, of the two thousand new ones, only seven to eight hundred are willing to go to the district meetings; the rest are not willing to leave their homes to meet in other places. Under these circumstances, we cannot expect these new ones to raise up small groups within a short time. Therefore, we still need to take those who originally attended the meetings in the halls as a foundation. By making a new arrangement for these small groups, we can gradually bring the new ones into them.</p>
<p>Today, the housing situation in Taipei is very different from what it used to be. In the old days, we mostly had single houses clearly separated from one another. But now, we have large apartment buildings within which are many dwelling units. When we have meetings with singing and praying in the homes, it is difficult not to disturb the neighbors. Hence, it is not easy to open up a new place for meeting. In addition, it is also quite difficult to ask the new ones to willingly open up their homes to have group meetings week after week. Therefore, a meeting place for the small groups also becomes a problem. As for the original four hundred groups, because they had been established a long time ago, the neighbors are more accustomed to the noise of our meetings. For this reason, we still need to utilize the original groups. However, it does not mean that we should never set up new small groups in the communities. If our newly baptized ones live far away from the existing groups, or if there is not a group that is suitable for them, it would not be easy to bring them to the group meetings. In such cases, we have to open up new small groups for them. This matter is related to the exercise and practice in our training. When you go to take care of home meetings and from the home meetings develop small group meetings, you need to consider the practical situation. For those living in remote places, there is the need to establish new small groups. It is not necessary for the training center to promote this, nor is it necessary for the elders or the district leaders to arrange for this. You workers need to make the decision according to the practical situation.</p>
<p>After the change of the system, our principle is freedom of development. Since you are the ones taking care of the home meetings in a practical way, and you understand their actual situation, you can work according to the practical needs. If the new ones live far away from the original small groups and it becomes difficult for them to attend, you need to set up new small groups for them. If their situation is not appropriate, and if no one has picked up the burden to start a new group, you need to help them travel a little farther to go to the most suitable place to attend group meetings. They can see the meeting for themselves and have a taste. In this way, they will be raised up gradually and will have the desire to establish small groups.</p>
