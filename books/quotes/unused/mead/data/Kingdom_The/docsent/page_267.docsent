   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY A RICH ENTRANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: James 2:5; Luke 12:29-32; 9:62; 2 Tim 4:1, 18; 2 Pet 1:1, 3-11; 3:11-12a, 18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nearly all of the writers of the New Testament, including Paul, John, and Peter, had something to say about the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Luke also said something, and James, even in his short book, has a very sweet verse concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>James 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only are we those rich in faith, but we are also heirs of the kingdom which God has promised to give to them who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kingdom is a matter of God's promise, and as such, is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The kingdom is a free gift!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God will give us the kingdom according to His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Luke, in his Gospel said the same thing: "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom" Luke 12:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only did God promise to give the kingdom to us, but it is His good pleasure to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is so happy to give us the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is His good pleasure, His good intention, and His joy to give us the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>WILLING TO RECEIVE THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although God is happy to give us the kingdom, are we willing to receive the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This gift is a matter of giving and receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It takes both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I have a gift for you, but you are not willing to receive it, what can I do?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is happy to give us the kingdom, but are we ready to receive the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is like salvation God is happy to give His salvation to people as a free gift, but so many worldly people have not received His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is because they are not willing to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is ready to give, but they will not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are you willing to receive the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is ready to give the kingdom, and we must be willing and ready to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all must say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank You for the kingdom, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am so willing to receive it."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SEEKING ONLY THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are willing to receive the kingdom, Luke gives us another verse: "And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" Luke 9:62 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we put our hands to the plow, taking the kingdom, and look back, we are not worthy of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are willing to take the kingdom, we must go on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must not look back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not seek the same things the worldly people are seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be concerned with what we eat, what we drink, and so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we must seek the kingdom of God, and God will add these things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we seek the kingdom of God, surely God will give us the kingdom plus all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not consider that it is such a high and difficult thing to receive the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because it is something of God's promise and free gift it is not that difficult to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To give us the kingdom is God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is happy to give us the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The only need is that we would be willing to receive the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are willing to receive the kingdom, we should forget about all the other things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God will take care of what we need what we eat and what we drink.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should take no thought about those things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God will take care of them.</S>
