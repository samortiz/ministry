   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If Christ's ministry were only on the earth in the flesh, He could not dispense anything into us.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the earthly ministry of Christ there is only the accomplishing; there is no dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whatever Christ accomplished was objective to us, not subjective, until He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His resurrection He began to impart, that is, to dispense, His divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The dispensing in Christ's ministry did not begin from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time when Christ went out of death and entered into resurrection, He imparted His divine life into all of us to regenerate us 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time His dispensing began.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today Christ is in the heavens, and He is very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For Christ to live in us means that He is not idle in us but is very active.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Spirit He not only lives in us, but He also dwells in us Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, He is now making His home in us Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He also strengthens us, sustains us, supports us, comforts us, supplies us, takes care of our case in the heavenly court, and intercedes for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His heavenly ministry He does everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As He ministers in His heavenly ministry, He has many statuses: He is the Lord of all Acts 2:36a , the Christ of God Acts 2:36b , the Leader of all the rulers and the Ruler of the kings of the earth Acts 5:31a; Rev 1:5b , the Savior Acts 5:31b , the High Priest Heb 4:15; 7:26 , the Advocate 1 John 2:1b , the Intercessor Heb 7:25 , the Mediator of the new covenant 8:6 , the surety of the new testament 7:22 , the Life-giver John 10:10b , the Comforter 14:16-17 , and the Lamb-God Rev 22:1b .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As such a One, He sustains us and supports us with the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have been speaking for the Lord for more than sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today I still have many subjects to speak on, and I also have the strength to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As far as I am concerned, I am nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, the more I speak, the more I have to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although I have spoken on Ephesians a number of times, I still have something further to speak because I am sustained, supported, strengthened, and supplied by Christ with the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The One who supplies me is not just the Spirit of God; today the Spirit of God has become the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This also is the good news of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you realize you are one spirit with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As those who are one spirit with God, we are not small persons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are one with God; we are a part of God John 15:5a; Eph 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Athanasius, a young theologian who participated in the Council of Nicaea, said concerning Christ, "He became man that we might be made God" and "The Word was made flesh..that we, partaking of His Spirit, might be deified."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Athanasius' word, God became a man that man might become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not only God in life and in nature, but we are one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit today is not merely the creating God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Spirit is the God who became incarnated, crucified, and resurrected, and who also became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reason that we can be one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has become a life-giving Spirit, and we have a spirit created by Him Zech 12:1 and regenerated by Him John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this universe these two wonderful spirits, the life-giving Spirit and the human spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Spirit, have come together to be mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is surely the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need some new songs to sing about our being one with God in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all need to praise the Lord, saying, "Praise You, Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today You are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You were God and You became a man, and now in Your resurrection You have become the life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this life-giving Spirit He can and He did dispense whatever He has, whatever He is, whatever He accomplished, whatever He is doing, and all His attainments and obtainments into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the Father's dispensing actually is a part of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit's dispensing also is a part of His dispensing.</S>
