   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RIVER FLOWING BY THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If there is no dealing of the cross, signified by the altar, the flow of the river will be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To have the flowing of the river, we need the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The flowing is always at the side of the altar, meaning that the flow is always by the cross 47:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are not willing to pass through the cross, we cannot expect that the flow will be prevailing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us willingly pass through the cross so that the flow will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE MAN WITH THE MEASURING REED</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The main point in this chapter is the man with the measuring reed in his hand 47:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The man, who is the Lord Jesus Himself, has the appearance of brass 40:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brass or copper in typology signifies judgment and testing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus as a man was tested and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because He was tested and judged, He is today testing and judging.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because He was tested, He is qualified to test; because He was judged, He is qualified to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the One with the measuring reed in His hand, fully qualified to measure us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have pointed out previously, to measure means to test, to judge, and to possess.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a sister goes to the store to buy a piece of cloth, first she examines the piece of cloth and then she measures it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever amount she measures, she also possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To measure means to examine, to test, to judge, and eventually to take over.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>MEASURING THE FLOW OF THE RIVER Measuring a Thousand Cubits</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The man came with a measuring reed in his hand to measure the flow of the river 47:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he first measured the river, there was only a trickle coming out from the house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He measured a thousand cubits and the flow became deeper, up to the ankle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He measured another thousand and the flow became deeper, up to the knee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he measured yet another thousand cubits, the flow became deeper, up to the loins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he measured the fourth time, the flow became a river which could not be passed over.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The river became waters to swim in. The number one thousand in the Bible signifies a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, in Psalm 84 the Psalmist said that he would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God for one day than to stay with an evil person for a thousand days.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, one thousand means a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To measure one thousand means to measure a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It means a complete measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we want to enjoy the flow out of the house, we must be measured completely.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we desire the flow out of the house to be deeper, we must be measured.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Remember, to be measured by the Lord means to be tested, to be examined, to be judged, and eventually to be taken over by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we want to enjoy a deeper flow, we have to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our motives, our intentions, our aims, our goals, and our desires all must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything we possess and everything we are involved in has to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will deepen the flow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thoroughly</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Confess thoroughly to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let the Lord be your judge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let Him bring you fully into His light and expose you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Tell Him, "Lord, all that You have judged is now Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You take over.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You take full possession."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord's judging and dealing with us is not once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this account, the man measured not only once, or twice, or even three times, but four times.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Four is the number of the creature, and this means as a creature we must be thoroughly judged and tested by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to be fully taken over by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be completely taken over by the Lord is not easy to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may think that we have been fully taken over by the Lord, but eventually after two weeks we will realize that we still have some reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At that time we need to be tested and judged again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to consecrate again and tell the Lord, "Lord take it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Possess it."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may think the Lord has taken over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the Lord knows He has only gained us to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A few months later, we may realize again how much we have reserved and preserved for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once more we confess and experience the Lord's judging and testing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How much we still need to let the Lord measure, test, judge, and possess us!</S>
