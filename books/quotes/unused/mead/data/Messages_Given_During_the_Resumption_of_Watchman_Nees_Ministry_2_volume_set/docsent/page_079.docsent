   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Testimony of Migration in Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the revival in Chefoo, of the eight hundred or more brothers and sisters, almost ninety percent of them consecrated everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Holy Spirit was working, and everyone was enlightened to repent in tears and to vow that they would never hold back the gospel again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many of the saints consecrated their families, their jobs, and everything they had to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we met together, there was a time when we had only tears before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During those days, no one preached much, and it is hard to describe the atmosphere of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once a person stepped into the meeting, he would feel the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The brothers and sisters consecrated all that they had.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some saints dared not open up their closets when they went home, for when they did, a voice within would say, "Consecrate!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One brother who was a judge observed the consecration of the brothers and sisters, and he remarked that what happened then was even more than what happened at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What he said may be too much, but this brother did not say things lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He could say such a word because God's work was really prevailing then.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time, there was a brother in his fifties who at one time saw the Lord Himself standing on the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the brother was giving the message, the Lord was standing beside him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What he saw was something real, not an illusion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During one of the meetings, I lifted up my hands to pray for about half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The words just kept coming unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was no need for me to think about what to pray; the words flowed out spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you ask me to repeat what I prayed then, I cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end, when I lifted up my two arms, one brother sitting in front of me lifted his hands also to hold up my arms.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After this, two groups of brothers and sisters migrated out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first group consisted of over seventy people, among whom over sixty of them had their traveling expenses taken care of by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later another thirty or more saints migrated to Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, the Lord is still blessing them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From that time on, many people began to pay attention to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we did not know what power it was that was upholding us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time, our meeting on Fourth Street became the subject of conversation for many people, and some rumored that we had a sack of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the Japanese came, they spent two and a half months to investigate me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the first group migrated out, we were going to send out the second group; the second group consisted of professionals, such as doctors and merchants.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not long after that, the Japanese arrested me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I was put into prison for a month.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I came out, I contracted a serious illness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a year, I left Chefoo and have not returned since.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ones who migrated went to Inner Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Ningsia.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Migration Being to Live for the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is some problem about settling in a place for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people were poor at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After they believed in the Lord, they took care of their businesses well and made profits from them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a result, they offer more.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But although they offer larger amounts, the percentage of offering compared with their profits becomes less and less.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, they may have made a thousand dollars in the first year, and they spent only a few hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The offering was fifty percent of their profit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After their business grew to a few hundreds of thousands of dollars, or tens of millions of dollars, they began to keep more for their own use, and they offer less percentage-wise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although they are clear in their prayer, they become confused in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When others come around and persuade them, they invest in real estate again or start more partnerships.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When opportunity comes and other businesses relocate elsewhere, they would buy the others' properties.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way, they become settled, and the heavenly people become rooted on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their roots embrace the earth, and they have "colonized" themselves on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the churches begin to take root this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the meetings, everyone agrees that we should not love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But in practice, it becomes entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When material wealth increases, offerings in the church increase, but so do the luxuries in the saints' homes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without realizing it, the church has become worldly and secular.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Migration is an uprooting in which a person sells all he has and moves to another place to live for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One doctor by the name of Wu once talked with me, and I told him that if he sold everything he had and moved to a certain place, he could practice medicine during the week, preach the gospel on the Lord's Day morning, and have a Bible study in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His wife could be a "sister-preacher."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In a year's time, he could very well bring a hundred people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If he would do this, after a few years, he could move to another place and do the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After a year in the second place, if he could not save a hundred people again, he could come to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you sell all you have and get only three billion dollars for a five billion dollar business, outwardly it seems that you have lost two billion dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Actually, you have gained your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Acts 1, after the Lord's resurrection, the disciples were interested in the question of the kingdom; they were not enthusiastic about going out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the end, the Lord had to send a fire to burn Jerusalem and force them out in that way Acts 8:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord's word says that the gospel would be preached from Jerusalem, through Judea, unto the remotest part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Need for a Revived Living</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God's children should be a "moving" people; they should not be a "staying" people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They should go to the frontier lands.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man cares for human relationships, and he is reluctant to move.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But God wants man to move.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the past God has gained some good vessels in China.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we will not do this for the Lord, who else will do it?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to practice this, first we must recover the preaching of the gospel, and we must have a revived living.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After this, we should migrate out.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Japanese may have been defeated, but something else may come.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Chefoo, we had the blessing because we sent people out.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At present, there are over thirty places with the Lord's table in Sui-yuan province already.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These brothers moved out from Chang-chia-kou, station after station, and went all the way from Chefoo to Sui-yuan province.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Migration Being Likened to a Relay Race</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At present, over a hundred brothers and sisters in Shanghai have signed up already.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whenever the Lord gives us the leading, and whenever there is the opportunity, these ones would migrate out.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today, we need a group of pioneers.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When a person moves out, he is really dropping everything.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In Shanghai we have about a thousand brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should have over fifty million dollars in offerings every month.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In Chefoo, the more the saints migrated, the more people we saw added to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In preaching the gospel, there is the need of stations.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is like a relay race.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Westerners have sent the gospel to the coastal regions of China.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Today, we have to carry the gospel from the coastal regions to the interior regions.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Westerners cannot open the door of the gospel in the interior regions.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Today, however, God will open this door through us.</S>
