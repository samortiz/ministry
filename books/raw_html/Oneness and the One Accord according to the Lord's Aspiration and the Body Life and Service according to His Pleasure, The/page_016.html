<h2 class=head2>Authority in the Body</h2><p>In order to live in the Body, we also have to recognize the authority in the Body. In a body, there is surely authority. Our human body is very orderly. In the same way, God has placed the members, each one of them, in the Body (1 Cor. 12:18) and has blended them together (1 Cor. 12:24). Every member has his own place ordained by God, and everyone should be in order. This is a fact with which we have to come to terms. By doing so, we will neither overestimate ourselves nor despise others, and we will not have any complaints or feel mistreated. All the members are under the authority in the Body.<p>In the matter of the authority in the Body, first and foremost is the need for the authority of the Head flowing throughout the whole Body (Eph. 5:23-24). In addition, there is deputy authority. In the local churches there are the elders (1 Tim. 5:17a), and in the work there are the leading co-workers (1 Cor. 3:10a). All these are deputy authorities, carrying out the authority of the Head. Hence, in the Body of Christ there is also order in authority. On the one hand, all the members submit directly to the Head (Eph. 5:24a). On the other hand, they submit to the deputies of the Head (Heb. 13:17). When we feel that we are submitting directly to the Head, we must also care for the Body. It is impossible for us to say that we are submitting to the authority of the Head without caring for the Body. We have to take care of both aspects. We should submit to Christ, and we should also submit to the church. Only then is the submission proper. If we would only submit to Christ, without submitting to the Body, that kind of submission will cause problems. If no one cares for the Body, but everyone considers that he is submitting to the Head directly, division will result in the Body. Only by our submitting to the Head on the one hand and to the Body on the other hand can the Head be pleased and the Body preserved.<h2 class=head2>The Authority of the Spirit and the Body</h2><p>Following this, we have to consider the authority of the Spirit and the Body. Second Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit. Thus, we can see that the Spirit is Christ and is therefore the embodiment of the Head. Today, He is living and moving in the members (Rom. 8:11, 13). Hence, if we are to live the Body life, we must submit to the Spirit and walk according to the Spirit. Otherwise, we are not living in the Body. A person who lives in the Body must surely submit to the Spirit, for to submit to the Spirit is to accept the authority of the Head in the Body.<h2 class=head2>The Members’ Feeling for the Body</h2><p>Since we are the members of the Body of Christ, we should have a feeling for the Body. First, we must take the feeling of the Head as our own feeling. In Philippians 1:8 Paul said, “I long after you all in the inward parts of Christ Jesus.’’ This means that Paul took the inward parts of Christ Jesus as his own inward parts in caring for the church. This also means that he took care of the Body of Christ by taking Christ’s feeling as his own feeling. Christ’s feeling became his feeling for the Body. We all should be like Paul, taking the feeling of the Head as our own feeling. This is most necessary for our living the Body life. Furthermore, we should not only take the feeling of the Head as our feeling, but also do so in the principle of caring for the Body. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12:25b-26 that “the members should have the same care for one another. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.’’ In order for us to have the Body life, we must care for our fellow members and must be full of feeling for the Body.<p>If we as members have the feeling of the Head in everything and care for the Body, we will take the Body as the rule in our mind, thoughts, words, and actions. We should deny ourselves and should identify ourselves with the Body. By doing this, there will be no separation or disconnection from the Body. The life that we live will fully be the Body life, and the Lord will gain the expression of His Body.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 7, 1990)
