Therefore, the Holy Spirit is for our experience of the Triune God. To experience the Triune God, we must have the practical experience of the Holy Spirit. A great part of our practical experience of the Holy Spirit is related to our being filled inwardly and outwardly with Him.<h2 class=head1>I. THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>The Bible clearly shows us that the Holy Spirit is with us in two aspects.<h2 class=head2>A. The Significances of the Two Aspects</h2><h2 class=head3>1. In</h2><p>1)&#8220;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you&#8221; (John 14:17).<p>Here the Lord tells us clearly that the Holy Spirit will be in us.<h2 class=head3>2. Upon</h2><p>1)&#8220;...the Holy Spirit has come upon you&#8221; (Acts 1:8).<p>On the one hand, the Lord spoke of the Holy Spirit being in us; on the other hand, He spoke of the Holy Spirit being upon us. To be upon us is outward and is absolutely different from being in us.<h2 class=head2>B. The Promises of the Two Aspects</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The Lord Promising the &#8220;Comforter&#8221;- Being Promised before the Lord&#8217;s Death</h2><p>1)&#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...even the Spirit of reality...shall be in you&#8221; (John 14:16-17); &#8220;If I go, I will send Him [the Comforter] to you&#8221; (John 16:7).<p>These are the words of the Lord before His death, promising the disciples that He would go in order to send the Holy Spirit as the Comforter.<h2 class=head3>2. The Father Promising the &#8220;Power&#8221;- Being Promised by the Father in the Old Testament and Spoken of Again by the Lord after His Resurrection</h2><p>1)&#8220;I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you...until you are clothed with power from on high&#8221; (Luke 24:49); &#8220;Wait for the promise of the Father...you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you&#8221; (Acts 1:4-8).<p>The Lord spoke these words to the disciples after His resurrection and before His ascension, speaking again of God&#8217;s promise in the Old Testament concerning the Holy Spirit. He promised that after He ascended to the heavens, He would send forth the Holy Spirit to be their power. The &#8220;power&#8221; is different from the &#8220;Comforter.&#8221; The Comforter was the One who would enter into the disciples and be &#8220;in&#8221; them, while the power would come &#8220;upon&#8221; them. Thus, what the Lord said before His death and what He said after His resurrection are two different promises.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life Lessons, Vol. 2 (#13-24) &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
