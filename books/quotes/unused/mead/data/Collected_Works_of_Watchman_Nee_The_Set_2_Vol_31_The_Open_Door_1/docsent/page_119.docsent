   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Letter from Brother Chen Meng-tsao,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chekiang Province</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I received the fifth issue of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He shows us more about the work and the travels of His servants so that we now have fresh burdens in our prayer and are more in one accord with all the saints.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We now see that God wants to call them to bear the spiritual yoke as well as to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is lacking now is the gifts in Ephesians 4.</S>
