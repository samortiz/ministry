Based on my experience over the past sixty years in the Lord’s recovery, I have put a question mark on the matter of a Christian’s humanity.<p>From the day I was saved, I have not known any worldly friend. Even my relatives are not that frequently in touch with me. For the past sixty years, I have been in contact with only one kind of people, Christians. Furthermore, most of those with whom I have had contact are Christians who love the Lord. But during the course of my contact with them during the past sixty years, what I have seen and experienced has put a question mark in me concerning a Christian’s humanity.<p>In 1922 I was saved in a little city in northern China. I was also raised up by the Lord there to practice the church life. At that time, I began to learn to speak for the Lord. Later, the Lord led me step by step to move to Shanghai. I was brought into contact with people of all nationalities. All these experiences opened my eyes more and more.<p>In 1949 I came to Taiwan. In 1956 I went to the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia. In 1960 I went further to the West, to the United States and Canada. In the end, I chose the uttermost part of the earth, Los Angeles, as the base of my work. In the years subsequent to that, I passed through Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, London, Denmark, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, India, Thailand, Japan, Guam, Hong Kong, Hawaii, and many other lands and countries. There are now over one thousand churches with about a hundred and fifty thousand saints all over the world. All kinds of peoples are here. I have contacted all types of people, and I have encountered all kinds of situations.<p>Because of this, by the Lord’s mercy and according to the history of His leading in the past, I feel that I can say something to you concerning the humanity of those who serve the Lord. All the people with whom I have contact are Christians. Many of them are even seeking, loving, and world-forsaking Christians. But among all these people with whom I have contact, many are wrong in their humanity. There is a problem and this bothers me very much. I was therefore brought to further consider two great items of truth: regeneration and transformation.<p>Although there are many Christian groups, I have not heard of any which emphasize regeneration and transformation more than we do. In 1962 when the Lord led me to begin working in America, prayer and the spirit were the first items to which we paid attention. This was how we began. After that, we released many truths concerning transformation and also put out some publications. All this happened twenty years ago. However, in my observation and contact during all these years, a question has been raised within me. How is it that some can be regenerated and transformed and yet still have a problem with their humanity? How is it possible that such a thing could ever happen in the Lord’s recovery?
