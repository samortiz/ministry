   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition, something related to the Lord Himself also took place in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God the Father came into us, God the Son came into us, and God the Spirit also came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now the Triune God is abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God makes an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not a small, temporary abode; rather, it is His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Philippians 2:13 proves that God the Father is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, Galatians 2:20a says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then 1 John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that God the Spirit as the anointing abides within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Father works in us, the Son lives in us, and the Spirit is always anointing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Holy Spirit of God is constantly anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>An anointing is like a cream which we apply to our face to soothe it with a pleasant feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, the Son is alive and living inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Likewise, the Father is the God of His plan, the God of His will, so He operates within us the willing and the working.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way, the Triune God makes an abode with us, that is, He dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have become the resting place of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do we realize that such a wonderful thing has happened to us?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The three persons of the Triune God are now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we truly realized that the Triune God is abiding in us, we would be ecstatic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The three persons of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are living and dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If today the President of the United States came to our house, we would be ecstatic.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But do we realize that the Triune God is now practically dwelling within us?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may say that you realize this, but how many times have you praised and thanked the Lord about this until you were beside yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have you ever praised the Lord in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The very Triune God dwells within us!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is something wonderful and beyond our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to realize the two aspects spoken of above.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Something related to ourselves happened to us, that is, a new heart and a new spirit were given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition, something related to God happened to us, that is, the three persons of the Triune God the Father, the Son and the Spirit are now dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we realize these two aspects, these wonderful facts, we will have the standing to know how to experience life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have a new heart, a new spirit, and the Triune God living, abiding, and dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The very life that we have received is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We often say that this life is the life of the Lord or the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, only once does the New Testament speak of the life of God Eph 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It also does not speak of the life of Christ; rather, it speaks of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is a difference between the life of Christ and Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A person has the life of his mother and father, but he may not have his mother and father themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we cannot have the life of Christ without having Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The life we have of Christ is Christ Himself; the life that we have received of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not have God and Christ, we do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must realize that the life we have received and enjoy is the very Triune God Himself God in Christ through the Spirit who is living, dwelling, and working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we may see the way to experience the life which we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This verse speaks of four matters: a law, the Spirit, life, and Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The law is of the Spirit, the Spirit is of life, and this law has freed us in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is life, and with this life there is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With any kind of life there is a certain law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A kind of law always accompanies a life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With the physical life there are many laws.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After we eat a meal, there is a law within our body, especially in our stomach, to carry out the digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is an automatic, unconscious action.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If something operates unconsciously in us, it is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we have trouble with our stomach, we are conscious of our digestion, but if we are normal and healthy, there is no consciousness of digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, there is an automatic working in our stomach, which is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Gravity is also a law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If someone throws a book into the air, there is no need to beg it to come down.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It always comes down according to a law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is always a law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have Christ in us, Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the Spirit of life, even life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Within this very life there is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to know how to experience life, we must know that this very life within us has a law, which is called the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>With such a law it is so easy to experience life.</S>
