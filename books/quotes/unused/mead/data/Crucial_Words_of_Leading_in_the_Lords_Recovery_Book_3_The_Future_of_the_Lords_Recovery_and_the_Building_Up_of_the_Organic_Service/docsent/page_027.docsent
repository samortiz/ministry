   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING SERVING FULL TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Serving the Lord requires time and energy; thus, we need some saints who will offer up their time and their energy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a must.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we should not have the concept that as soon as we offer ourselves up, we are a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not have preachers among us; we are all the Lord s witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the Lord moves in our environment so that our living is provided for, then we can serve Him full time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the Lord does not provide for our living in this way, we must have a job.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the pattern left to us by the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul was a full-time serving one, but there were times when the churches did not support him; that is, the offerings from the saints were not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, he made tents with his own hands to supply not only his own needs but also the needs of his companions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not mean that Paul was a preacher for a few years and then opened a tent factory when he was not paid.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not say that when we are full-time serving ones, we are members of the clergy or that we have entered a religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not have a religious organization; we are brothers and sisters just like the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Lord has blessed us with the burden to use all our time and energy for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though some brothers do not serve full time, we cannot say that they are not co-workers or that they are not in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Were Aquila and Priscilla full-time serving ones?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is correct to say that they were full-timers, and it is also correct to say that they were not full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This couple did not only serve the Lord with their time and energy; they also opened their home for the Lord s use.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wherever they went, there were meetings in their home; this was the case in Rome and in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this aspect they served full time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, in Acts 18:1-3 when Paul was in Corinth, he remained with them and worked, because their profession was also tent-making.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have fellowshipped in the past about the need for the church in Taipei to produce five hundred serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Two hundred of these will serve full time, and three hundred will serve part time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some saints are able to offer up all their time, but others cannot give all their time; they can give only part of their time to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is still very good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This helps with finances, it is a good testimony, and it helps bring people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a desire that our university graduates would not work immediately after graduating or upon completing their military service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, they should fulfill two years of church military service.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During these two years, they should spend four hours every morning to read the Life-study messages and the Recovery Version with the footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They will be able to finish reading the Recovery Version with the footnotes in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, they will be able to finish reading all the Life-study messages; this is roughly twelve hundred messages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a good education.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the afternoon they will have time to rest and fellowship, and in the evenings they will either attend meetings, go to the campuses to contact people, or go visit people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After two years we will see what the Lord has manifested in them and what their desire and burden are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is a clear manifestation of the Lord in them, and if their burden is strong, they can continue to serve for one, two, or even three more years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This way we will be able to determine who should get a job.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some brothers and sisters must obey their parents; they cannot make their own decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If their parents do not agree for them to be in such a program, the saints should not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We hope that through this practice, the church would not be just a home and a hospital but also a spiritual school for the saints to be educated in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will have a tremendous influence on the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are four areas that we must develop in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, we must recover the brothers and sisters who have been absent from the meetings for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Taipei there are at least ten thousand such saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to go and fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, we must do a gospel work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The junior high schools, the high schools, the junior colleges, and the universities all need such a work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need enough full-time serving ones to do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Third, we must actively promote the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We hope that within one year there will be ten thousand children in the children s meetings of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Fourth, we must preach the gospel in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must take advantage of the people we know, and we must contact our relatives, colleagues, and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need many saints to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must be clear that this is the Lord s leading, and we must have faith that the Lord will bless His church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord will also bless this country and this society because of this move.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should pray for our country and for our society.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must especially pray for the president and the officials of this country and ask the Lord to give them wisdom so that this country would progress until it is full of the gospel and the truth.</S>
