   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE WORD BEING TO SUPPLY AND ADMINISTRATION BEING FOR BUILDING UP CARING FOR PRACTICAL NEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN GIVING MESSAGES, NOT PROFUNDITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter we considered our need to study how to use the ministry of the word to uplift the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition, the ministry of the word should be living and practical; it does not depend on lofty subjects and deep content.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not think that subjects such as regeneration and dealing with sins are too shallow simply because others have already spoken on these subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This concept is very wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ministry of the word depends on the need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If some need to hear a message on regeneration, we should give a living word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I believe that even the apostle Paul sometimes liked to hear others preaching the gospel; he probably received the supply through their gospel preaching, because the preaching was living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some brothers feel that it is not easy to give a message in the church in Taipei, because the saints have heard good and high messages in the conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the speaking is on a common subject, the saints have heard it, but if the speaking is on a high subject, the saints cannot come up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In ministering the word, the content should not be too high.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is wrong to go to the high places to find a way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not normal to walk on the rooftops.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who try to walk on rooftops are looking for trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, we should always choose a clear and unobstructed way when we walk, and since there would be no obstructions, the way can be taken repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we should not be afraid of old subjects; we should be afraid only of old utterances and old ways of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The topic can be the same, but there must be different ways to present it so that it will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no profit in our striving for extra lofty messages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should believe that among the ministers raised up by God in the church, some will function to supply the church with fresh and original things, and others will not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The brothers and sisters do not need profound words in order to be supplied; they simply need ordinary words in order for them to be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ones are being saved every day, and they need to know how to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who have already consecrated themselves, however, need to refresh their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we do not necessarily need to give lofty messages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to labor to receive a burden from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should hold to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must see the need of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead of caring for whether a message is shallow or deep, we should care for the genuine need of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The speaking in regular meetings is always different from the speaking in the conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Conferences release messages at specified times to sow the need of the church into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The saints should digest these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The speaking on the Lord s Day, however, is to meet the general needs of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, there is no need to consider whether the message is shallow or deep, and there is also no need to be concerned that it has been spoken by others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our only concern should be whether it meets the need of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For a message to meet the need, our words must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should never be afraid that a common subject is too shallow for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, there is no such thing as a shallow message.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even a shallow message can minister deep things into people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1942 a brother who was meeting in a denomination often came to our meetings in order to hear the gospel messages.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even though the gospel is a very simple message by which unbelievers are saved, this brother eventually turned to the ground of the church because of these gospel messages.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who bear the responsibility of the ministry of the word should have a change in concept.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not consider whether a topic is profound or simple or whether others have already spoken on it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead of considering such matters, we should receive a burden to see exactly what the brothers and sisters need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once we receive a burden, we should study to find a living way to present it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not mean that our words need to be lively, fluent, or persuasive but rather that we should speak words of life to touch, move, and uplift the spirit of the saints and to convict them in their spirit, thereby setting them free.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is where we should spend our energy and effort.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we need to fervently pray: Lord, today I am speaking on regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must give me a fresh and living word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our speaking should be such that even the apostle Paul would say that our speaking touched his inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our speaking should render even experienced believers a supply that is as fresh, cool, and watering as the morning dew.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even though regeneration is an old topic that has been spoken about many times, we should still give people a fresh supply in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the living word.</S>
