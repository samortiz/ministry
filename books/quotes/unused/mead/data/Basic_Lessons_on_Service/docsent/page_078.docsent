   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Following the previous lesson concerning strange fire, we need this lesson on taking heed how to build.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These lessons may be considered as a pair, like two "sisters."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They are brief, so they need much labor and development on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION HAVING BEEN LAID</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to tell the saints that all real service is a building work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church service is not merely a work, but a building work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are many works which are not building works.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only certain works are building works.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since we are going to serve, to build, we have to realize that we cannot lay a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The unique foundation has been laid by the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we are still building on his foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul said, "According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation.."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1 Cor 3:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then he said, "For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BUILDING ON THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our service must be a building work on the unique foundation 1 Cor 3:10m .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot lay a foundation, nor can we build something on another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to strongly stress these points.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though all denominations claim that Christ is their foundation, actually many works in today's Christianity are building works on some other foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not like to set up social and charitable works such as schools and hospitals.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostle Paul did not do this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our service must be a direct building on the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is much charitable work in Christianity which is good, but it is not built upon Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever we do in the church must be something built directly on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why the apostle Paul spoke such a strong word in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BUILDING WITH GOLD, SILVER,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>AND PRECIOUS STONES</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The proper building materials for the church are gold, silver, and precious stones 1 Cor 3:12a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Gold symbolizes the divine nature of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Silver symbolizes Christ's redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Precious stones symbolize the Spirit's transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that what we build upon the foundation of Christ should be something of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
