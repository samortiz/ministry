   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF MANNA Coming with the Dew</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider the various aspects of the manna in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Numbers 11:9 says, When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Manna always comes early in the morning with the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does the dew signify?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 133:3 says, As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible, dew signifies God s gracious visitation from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God comes from the heavens to visit us as grace, He is like the dew, so precious and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That manna always comes with the dew signifies that the very Christ who is our manna today always comes with grace, with God s gracious visitation from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we touch Christ as our life supply, we have the deep sense that heaven has come to us in a soft, watering manner.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This watering is so well proportioned that it does not trouble us, but it certainly refreshes us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we enjoy touching Christ as our manna, we have the sense that heaven has come down to visit, water, and refresh us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Small</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Exodus 16:14 describes manna as a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although some hymns have been written to praise Christ for His greatness, we also need to praise Him for His smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Manna was small; yet the Bible does not give us its dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although manna is small, it is immeasurable; we cannot say how small it is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that we cannot tell the size of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our Christ is without size.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing is smaller than He is, and nothing is greater than He is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the smallest as well as the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nothing can exceed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who can measure the greatness or the smallness of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Round</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are also told that the manna was round Exo 16:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In typology, this signifies that manna is eternal, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is the eternal food with the eternal nature for the eternal nourishment without any limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whoever eats Him will have the eternal life with the eternal nature and receive the eternal nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Like the Frost</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Manna was like the frost Exo 16:14 , which is between dew and snow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Dew is refreshing, but it is not as refreshing as frost is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although dew refreshes, it does not kill the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Frost does kill germs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As manna, Christ not only refreshes us; He also kills all the negative things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He comes with the dew, and He comes as the frost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever we experience Christ as the supply, we sense that heaven has come down to visit and water us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While we are being watered and refreshed, we also sense that the negative things within us, such as our negative attitudes, are being killed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I enjoy the refreshing and the killing of this frost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If two brothers are upset with one another, it means that they need the killing of the frost.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The frost not only kills the negative things in us; it also cools us down.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the young people love the Lord, sometimes they are hot for sports.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If they do not have the time to go to a football game, they may at least try to watch a game on television.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When, while they are so hot for sports, they touch Christ, the frost will come to cool them down.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Other brothers and sisters like to talk, talking in vain words about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we talk like this, we are hot.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when we touch Christ, the frost cools us down.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The older brothers and sisters also need to be cooled down by the frost.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the older sisters love their husbands, if we would ask the husbands to speak frankly, they would say that they cannot stand the bothering of their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Neither can the older sisters bear the bothering of their retired husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many of the retired brothers have little to do every day except to bother their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By this we see that even the older ones need to be cooled down.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The older we are, the more bothersome we are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, we all need the frost to cool down our hot temper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a sense, this frost is our spiritual refrigerator.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The very Christ within us who nourishes us is also the frost which freezes us.</S>
