   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS CO-WORKERS' MEETING 12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:6:30 a.m., April 19, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE SOLID CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>HANDING OVER ONESELF TO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We believe that many of the critical issues in consecration have to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But there are two conditions to consecration without which our consecration will not be solid.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first factor has to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consecration is not simply for us to hand ourselves over to the Lord, but for us to hand ourselves over to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Surely when a person consecrates himself, he hands himself over to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But no one knows when this kind of consecration has changed or has been retracted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the consecration that is done under the authority of the church is solid, and only this kind of consecration will last.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a man says that he is consecrating himself, yet has not handed himself over to the church, such a consecration is not solid.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE THOROUGH CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>INVOLVING MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second thing about consecration is that it always touches our money and our occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A consecration that does not result in handing oneself over to the church is not solid, and a consecration that does not touch one's money and his occupation is not thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two subjects, money and occupation, require special attention.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>MONEY The Relationship between God,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All Things, and Money</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How does God see money?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here we need to understand two kinds of relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first is the relationship between God and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second is the relationship between all things and money.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God made from one all things Acts 17:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything a person touches with his hands and treads over with his feet is made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God not only made from one all things; He is even the Lord of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan is God's adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet he cannot deal with God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because he cannot deal with God directly, he deals with all the things that issue from God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because Satan cannot damage God Himself, he tries to damage God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If Satan can snatch God's creation out of His hand, God will have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to damage God's work, Satan tries to snatch away God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God Making from One All Things,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whereas Satan Unifying All Things through Money</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today I wish to point out to you the relationship between all things and money, and the relationship between all things and God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan tries to gain all things, but he cannot gain every item of all the things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"All things" are too much for him to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is too troublesome to gain all things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"All things" include the cows, the goats, wood, stone, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You cannot exhaust the whole list of all things with a thousand lines.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God made from one all things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, Satan reduces all things into one kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This one thing is money.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is nothing in this world that cannot be bought with money.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a person has money, he has all things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why "money" in Chinese is tung-hwo, which means the "common good."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You cannot call a piece of stone plus a piece of wood, two of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You cannot call a chair plus a table, two of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But through the invention of money, Satan is able to unify all things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He makes all things simple.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Originally, the world with all its myriads of items was made from one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now Satan is unifying these myriads of things into one through money.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything that we see today can be reckoned in terms of money.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That is why money is the means to unify all things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All things are created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only money is not created by God; it comes from Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When men asked Christ if there was a need to pay tribute money, He asked them to show Him a denarius, and He answered, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar" Matt 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He did not take any money out from His own pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Had He done this, others would have said that He too had Caesar in His pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Money is created by Satan for the purpose of unifying all things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All things can be reckoned in terms of money.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The earth is created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet, today man can reckon the price of lands in terms of money.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If it is possible, man will even reckon the price of the moon, or the hydrogen in the sun, with money.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today man can buy everything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He can buy time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He can even buy human souls.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One brother worked in the post office for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The post office has bought his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Included in Jacob's wealth, there were the cattle and the sheep, and there were also the souls of men.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Revelation 18 tells us that the human soul is a commodity that can be bought and sold vv.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>12, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God has made from one all things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But Satan has unified all things into one.</S>
