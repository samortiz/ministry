<h2 class="head1">SETTING UP MEETINGS<br />
IN THE NEW ONES&rsquo; HOMES</h2>
<p>After leading people to salvation through door-knocking, we should immediately set up a meeting in their home. This is to nourish them after begetting them. What we practiced in Taiwan was mainly an experiment in order to learn what was effective and efficient in door-knocking. Three terms of research have proven that door-knocking is effective and efficient. We gained more than forty thousand new ones, but only a little over six thousand have remained, because we do not have enough saints to take care of them. The other thirty-four thousand are not false ones; they did not remain because they were not cared for. Therefore, we should not baptize too many new ones, nor should we walk away fifteen minutes after someone is baptized. We have begotten too many babies and are unable to take care of them. Hence, we need to consider our capacity to nourish the new ones. We should not beget so many new ones if we are not able to feed them. Otherwise, they will die, and they will not be left with a good feeling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Extending the Time of &ldquo;Delivery&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Begetting fewer for the sake of caring for them does not mean that we need to extend the time of &ldquo;delivery.&rdquo; We still need to practice leading people to be baptized within fifteen minutes. Prolonging the time does not necessarily mean that people will be saved. The shining of the light of the gospel and the strength of the power of the Spirit can cause a person to be saved and baptized within fifteen minutes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Edifying New Believers<br />
Immediately after Their Salvation</h2>
<p>We should not leave immediately after leading someone to salvation. We need to sit down with him and his household for one hour to edify him. First, we should lead him to sing a hymn concerning the assurance and joy of salvation. Then we should ask him to pray and teach him to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We may say, &ldquo;Our Lord Jesus is the eternal God, but in order to save us, He became flesh and died on the cross for our sins. Then He was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit. Today He entered into you as the Spirit. We thank the Lord that He created you with a human spirit. When you repented and confessed your sins, your conscience was enlivened, and you were washed by the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood. As a result, the life-giving Spirit entered into your spirit and is mingled with you as one spirit. Our pneumatic Lord has a name. Whenever we call on His name, we will enjoy and experience Him. The way to call on His name is to use our spirit and call from deep within, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus!&rsquo; This is like taking a deep breath. Then you will feel comfortable, at ease, peaceful, and joyful.&rdquo; After leading someone to be baptized, we must stay for an hour to teach him basic truths and help him to exercise his spirit. This will make him stable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Teaching the New Believers<br />
in the Home Meetings</h2>
<p>We must &ldquo;strike while the iron is hot.&rdquo; We should not wait a week before going back to visit a new believer. Rather, after three days we should go back and teach him to read the Bible. After another three days we should teach him to sing hymns. It is best to visit a new believer ten times during the first month. This is the way to make him stable. After the first month, we can visit him once a week for half a year. This will establish him. Within the first six months we need to teach him how to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, to speak for the Lord, to testify, to read the Bible, and to receive light from the Lord. We should not bring him to the meeting hall or to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings. Rather, we need to set up a meeting in his home. We should gather his family, his spouse and children, together and help them to function in the meeting. We may even ask the little ones to pray and to sing. By functioning in this way, his family members who are not yet saved will be saved. This kind of home meeting is a church meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Changing Our Way of Meeting</h2>
<p>We must have a big change in the way that we meet. We cannot continue to meet as we have in the past, with a rigid and formal big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning for everyone to come and listen to a message, a meeting in the evening for the Lord&rsquo;s table, a meeting for prayer on Tuesday night, and sometimes a meeting on Thursday night. We must be flexible and focus on the homes. After a new one is saved, we should not compel him to attend the church meetings; instead, we should immediately set up a meeting in his home to nourish, to teach, and to perfect him. Although this time should be flexible and according to the new one&rsquo;s convenience, we must meet in his home at least once a week. Such a practice will keep the new believers from dying prematurely.</p>
