   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PORTION OF CHRIST BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can you practice this?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that you already know that you have to labor on Christ all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And you already know that you need to come to the meeting with Christ filling your hand and filling you inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But now I would like to fellowship with you about this one point: you should have some amount of faith to believe that you do have some portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I tell you, Satan is a liar!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan is tricking us, telling us a lie that we have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan has cheated all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He always points out that we don t have a good attitude toward our wife, that we are not victorious in our family living, so how can we dare to shout and to declare or to proclaim something?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Accusation from Satan has subdued you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If Aaron had been altogether victorious, altogether clean and pure, then he would not have needed the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Don t forget that when the children of Israel came together, they firstly needed the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the word offering implies a certain degree of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The blood was shed and poured upon the altar signifying redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every time we come to the meeting we need the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Claim the blood, and apply the blood to your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes you may have been a little negligent, not so much on the alert, and you lost your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So you got a defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Still come to the meeting!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Claim the blood!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apply the blood to your situation by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then you have to tell Satan, Satan, even though I got a defeat, yet I still have some amount of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes you have to stand up and tell the saints, Dear saints, just thirty-five minutes ago I was defeated in a situation with my family.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But I have applied Christ as my sin offering!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His blood has cleansed me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I would like to tell Satan before you all that I have an amount of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FORMALITY BECAUSE OF DEADNESS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I believe if we all would practice in this way, our meetings would be delivered from being formal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The formality in today s Christian services is due to the deadness of all the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because every one comes in dead some form is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need someone to do this for us, and we need another one to do that for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need someone to sing a solo for us, and we need a group wearing long robes to sing a quartet for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All these formal things are full of death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A PORTION TO SATISFY EVERY PARTY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of us should come with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should come not only with Christ as our burnt offering, our meal offering, our peace offering, but also as our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even we should come with Christ as our wave offering and our heave offering, offering the breast in love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We come with a resurrected Christ offering Him in love and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We bring the ascended Christ of strength and power, and we share Him in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Have you noticed of all these different kinds of offerings, even with the sin offering, the priests, all the clean ones, have the right to eat a portion?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was the same with the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course the burnt offering was burned completely to be food for God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With the meal offering some was burned for God s food and the rest was for the priests food.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The priests didn t eat secular food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They ate the meal offering and the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The peace offering is so rich: there is a portion for God, a portion for the offering people, a portion for the ministering priests, and a portion for the priests family.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is also a portion for others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the peace offering because this is the offering that satisfies every party.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So we all are satisfied; we all have peace; we all have joy; we all have the enjoyment with satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the real peace!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is to offer Christ to God for His food and to eat Christ ourselves and to rejoice in what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Don t forget these three words: offer, eat, and rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is to meet!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Offer Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eat Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rejoice in Christ!</S>
