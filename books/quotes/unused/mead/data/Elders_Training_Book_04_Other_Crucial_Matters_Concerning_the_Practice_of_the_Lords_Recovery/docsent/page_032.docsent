   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Denying Our Disposition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I may be a person living in my particular nature and in my peculiar disposition, which is always so straight and so insistent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am very strict about not receiving anyone whom I feel is not genuinely regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I think I am keeping the proper principle, but actually I am keeping my peculiar disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not practice your disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must practice God's nature, not your nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To receive people you must keep in mind three things: 1 the proper principle of receiving the saints; 2 not being overconfident in your feeling; and 3 not being according to your disposition but according to God's nature of love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To receive people whom you are not sure whether or not they are truly regenerated is safer than not to receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you do not receive them, you may miss them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some of the ones that you do not receive may eventually be very useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may appreciate a certain one and you would receive him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After some time, however, he might become a problem to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who can tell?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must go the safer way of receiving people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This does not mean, however, that we receive whoever comes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They must believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They have to confess the Lord's name, As long as they believe in the Lord Jesus, and confess their sins, do not demand more of them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not practice any principle according to your kind of taste which actually is not your taste, but your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is your particular and peculiar disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must deny our disposition in receiving the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>LOSING THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this point, I would like to study with you a number of portions of the Word which deal with the matter of a believer losing the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matthew 18:15-17</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first portion concerning this matter is in Matthew 18:15-17: "Now if your brother sins, go, reprove him between you and him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he hears you, you have gained your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you as the Gentile and the tax collector."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If one brother sins, we should not expose him, but "reprove him between you and him alone."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he does not hear you, you should not spread the thing to many, but just to one or two among us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If this brother refuses to hear you and the other one or two, you should tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is crucial and this is the last step.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If this brother refuses to hear the church, the Lord Jesus tells us to "let him be."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These three words, "let him be," comprise a crucial point for us to interpret.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Let him be" is an interpretation of one Greek word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Greek word is not a strong word and does not mean cut him off, cast him out, or put him aside.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even to "consider him" as a Gentile is stronger than the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we exercise to understand the holy Word, especially to interpret it, we should not do it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be like a lawyer understanding and interpreting the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot do it carelessly since this is not the human law but the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the Greek in verse 17 the meaning is to "let him be what he is."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means to look on him as a Gentile losing the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This matter is up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not your doing nor is it the elders' doing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some have argued with me concerning the interpretation of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They understood that this verse meant to excommunicate him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus here, however, does not mean that.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though a certain brother may not be directly offending you, this brother sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You should go to him in love to recover him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, however, you must bring his case to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If this one would still refuse to listen, should you excommunicate him?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No. Let him be to you as one who loses, who misses, the fellowship as a Gentile and as a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Note 173 in Matthew 18 Recovery Version says, "If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church like the Gentile, the heathen, and the tax collector, the sinners who are outside the fellowship of the church."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In other words, this matter is up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He loses the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not for you to cut him off.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must realize that to cut a saint off from the church is a tremendously serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we cut off people from the church, we do not value the church fellowship properly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we treasure the church fellowship highly, we would not cut people off from this fellowship, because it is so high.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To cut off people so easily and so broadly means that we do not treasure the fellowship and that we do not value the fellowship properly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you possess a treasure of tremendous value, you should handle it very carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is easy, however, to cut off something cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we cut off something easily, this means that we do not treasure that item and that we deal with it cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church fellowship is precious beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not keep anyone out of this fellowship lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must be careful.</S>
