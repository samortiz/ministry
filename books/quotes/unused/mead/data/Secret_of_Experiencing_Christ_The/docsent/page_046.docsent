   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ORDINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A second negative thing we confront after being saved is ordinances 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ordinances mentioned in Ephesians 2 refer to different ways of living and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As believers, we are part of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, ordinances are a hindrance to the formation of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the different nationalities have their particular ordinances, their own rituals, ways, and practices with respect to worship and daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Jews have their ordinances, and the Moslems have their ways and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those from the various countries in Europe have their ways, and the people in the Far East have theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever those with different ordinances try to come together, there is friction, even enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How then is it possible for different peoples to become the constituents of the one new man?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Humanly speaking, it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in Ephesians 2 Paul declares that the ordinances have been nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This has made it possible for those of different nationalities to be one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even though the ordinances have been nailed to the cross, they may still be very prevailing among both believers and unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you have the assurance that you are no longer under the influence of ordinances?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you take the time to visit believers in other countries, you will no doubt be exposed as still having certain ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, although we cannot say that we are no longer influenced by ordinances, the situation among the saints in the churches is much better now than it was several years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Throughout the years in the church life, we have seen the gradual disappearance of ordinances among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But there is still the need for more improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ordinances certainly are contrary to the proper experience of the church life, the Body, Christ's fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>WINDS OF DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A third negative thing in Ephesians is the winds of teaching, or the winds of doctrine 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Doctrine has been a wind to blow believers away from Christ, the Head, and away from the church, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Almost all Christians today are influenced by some wind of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you meet another believer, often the first thing he will ask is what church you attend.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then he may go on to inquire about certain doctrines and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After I began the ministry in this country in 1962, I was invited to speak at different places.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In almost every place I was asked questions about such doctrines as eternal security, absolute grace, baptism, and the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order not to offend those who asked, I answered very carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When asked about eternal security, I replied, "The best security is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regarding absolute grace, I said, "To me, no grace is more absolute than Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, concerning baptism, I answered, "The best way to be baptized is to be crucified with Christ on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With respect to the rapture, I replied, "If you love the Lord and wait for Him to come back, He will certainly rapture you."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These answers seemed to neutralize the doctrinal differences and to subdue the doctrinal winds.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The wind of doctrine has distracted Christians from the proper experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some who have been distracted by doctrine accuse us of confusing the doctrine of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, they themselves may not believe in the Trinity, but in tritheism, in three Gods, regarding the Father as separate from the Son, and the Son as separate from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, they believe in a kind of corporate God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By contrast, we teach the genuine Trinity in keeping with the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the Bible, God is triune; this means that He is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may say that God is three-in-one, but it is more accurate to say that He is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are not able to figure this out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We were not created with the capacity to fathom the Triune God, but we were created with the ability to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Shortly after we moved to Anaheim, some opposing ones distributed a mimeographed paper which said that the Father, Son, and Spirit were three distinct and separate Persons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later we put out writings saying that the three Persons are distinct, but not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To claim that the Father, Son, and Spirit are separate is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the Bible, the Father and the Son cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How could it be possible to separate Them?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the light of the Bible, we believe in the co-inherence of the Three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We believe that the Three exist as one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whereas we believe that the Father, Son, and Spirit co-exist mutually for eternity, many Christians teach tritheism, especially those blown about by winds of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise the Lord that in the local churches we are saved from the distracting winds of doctrine!</S>
