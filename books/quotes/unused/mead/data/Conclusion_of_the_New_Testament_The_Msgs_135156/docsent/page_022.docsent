   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>38 Leading Them as His Many Sons into Glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hebrews 2:10 tells us that God is "leading many sons into glory."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These many sons are the many brothers of Christ the Firstborn in Romans 8:29.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last step of God's great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory, that is, to bring them into His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8:29 and 30 tell us that God's work of grace upon us began with His foreknowing, continued through His predestination, calling, and justification, and will end with His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This will be accomplished by the Lord's coming back Phil 3:21 , at which time we shall appear with Him in glory Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This glorification of the sons of God, as the goal of God's salvation, will be manifested in fullness in the New Jerusalem for eternity Rev 21:11, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through regeneration the life of glory was dispensed into us, and now we have a seed of glory within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This seed, this life of glory, is Christ in us, the hope of glory Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, this seed will blossom, and thereby we shall be brought into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, the glory into which God is leading us is the glory which He has already given us John 17:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although glory has been given to us already, it is still necessary for God to bring us into it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's leading the believers as His many sons into glory will be the ultimate consummation of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the dispensing of the Triune God will consummate in our being brought into God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we see this, we shall depend not on teaching but on God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mere teaching cannot bring us into God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is only by the divine dispensing that we shall be constituted into God's inheritance and eventually brought into His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This dispensing will cause the seed of glory within us to grow until it blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The blossoming of the seed of glory will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the divine dispensing will cause us to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May we all see that our loving Father is dispensing Himself into us and that through His dispensing He is bringing us into His glory.</S>
