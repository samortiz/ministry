<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE COORDINATION OF THE ELDERS</H1><P>In the chapter regarding authority we have mentioned that the authority of the elders requires coordination. Thus, the coordination of the elders is closely related to their being the authority. If there is no coordination among the elders in a local church, regardless how strong an individual elder may be, his strength is of no avail. However, when the coordination of the elders exists, though the elders are weak, they can still stand and go on. Strength without coordination is useless, whereas weakness with coordination is tolerable. We can see that the coordination of the elders is of utmost importance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE ELDERS BEING PLURAL IN NUMBER</H2><P>The Bible shows us that in every church the elders should be plural in number. A church cannot have one elder only. If there is only one elder in a local church, the condition is abnormal and absolutely unscriptural. Regardless how young a church is, there should be at least two or three elders. For the sake of coordination, the elders must be plural in number. If an individual handles everything, bears everything, and deals with everything, it is as if he is but singing solos. However, the administration of the church is not a solo, but rather a chorus in a play. Therefore, the elders must coordinate together. Whenever the coordination is missing among the elders, they will become worthless. The worth of the elders depends upon their coordination. For this reason, the elders must be plural in number.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. A MINIATURE OF THE BODY</H2><P>The church is the Body of Christ. A local church is the expression of the Body of Christ in a locality, whereas the elders in a local church are the miniature of that expressed body. When the elders are together in coordination, they constitute the smallest form of this body, and as such they are the miniature of the Body of Christ.</P><P>In this age, God's greatest need is to have the church built up. Where there is no building, there is nearly no church. From the way the Israelites were arrayed according to their fathers' houses in the book of Numbers, we have seen how the church needs to be built up. In this building, the elders occupy a most important and distinctive position. If a church does not have any elders, not only will there be no building, but it will be extremely difficult to have a church at all. Without the elders, there is no way to talk about the building.</P><P>In order for a church to be built up, there is first the need for the elders to be built up. How can a church be built up if its elders are not built up? The building of the church is a matter of the coordination of the saints, but if the elders within a church cannot coordinate together, how can they help the brothers and sisters to coordinate? Therefore, the building and the coordination in the church are entirely in the hands of its elders, and they are dependent upon them. Moreover, the elders must be the initiators and the examples in the building of the church. If there is no real building and coordination among the elders, there will be no initiators of the building up and the coordination of the church. In other words, there cannot be a beginning, and there is no way for the matter to be realized. Hence, for the sake of the building of the church, the elders must be the model and example of coordination. This model and example is the initiator in a local church. Only by this way can the few elders in a practical way build up and coordinate the saints together. They can do this because there is a model seen in them already. Spontaneously, they can take the saints on in this way of coordination and building.</P><P>Hence, we see that God's will depends on the church, and the church is fully a matter of coordination and building, while the coordination and building of the church hinges fully on the elders. The elders are the smallest miniature of the Body. If there is no coordination and building with the elders, there will be no way to talk about the coordination and building up of the church.</P>
