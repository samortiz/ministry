THE SPIRIT, THE CHURCH, LIFE, ETC. IN OUR HYMNAL</h2>
<p>The speaking ones in our meetings must know some of the hymns on Christ, the Spirit, the church, life, etc. in our hymnal (1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16). If we want to know the hymnal, we must spend some time to get into the table of contents of our hymnal. The hymns are divided into thirty major categories arranged in a proper sequence according to the truth. Each major category has a number of subcategories. Under the major category &ldquo;Experience of Christ&rdquo; there are thirty-two subcategories. Thank the Lord that we have the Bible and also a hymnal with hymns that were composed according to the truths of the Bible. Our main hymnal has one thousand and eighty hymns, and our supplement has two hundred and sixty-eight hymns. We composed our main hymnal with so many hymns to show others that we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have the knowledge of the truth. We put many hymns into the hymnal mainly for our knowledge of the truth and not for our singing. Among these one thousand and eighty hymns, there are at least over three hundred very good hymns which are good for singing and for speaking. We should know a hymn like #499&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo;&mdash;and we should learn to speak it. From now on we have to learn to use the hymns firstly for speaking. Singing the hymns is not as important as speaking them. We have discovered in the Word and in our experience that speaking a hymn is much more important and profitable than singing it. Hymn #501&mdash;&ldquo;O glorious Christ, Savior mine&rdquo;&mdash;and hymn #539&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!&rdquo;&mdash;are other excellent hymns that we should know and learn to speak. We must endeavor to learn a number of the crucial hymns in our hymnal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESPERATELY ENDEAVORING TO BUILD UP A HABIT<br />
OF SPEAKING IN ANY MEETING</h2>
<p>We all have to desperately endeavor to build up a habit of speaking in any meeting (1 Cor. 14:26, 4-5, 12, 31). We must be desperate to build up a habit to speak. This habit has to be built up universally in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We do not have such a habit due to the background of Christianity, and our function has been killed because of this background. Many Chinese people do not speak English well because they did not have the habit of speaking English when they grew up, and they still do not have this habit. I did not pick up the habit of speaking English until I began to minister the word in the United States in 1962. It was hard for me to acquire this habit, but for my grandchildren it was easy because they grew up in an English-speaking environment. If we learn to build up a habit of speaking in any meeting, our children, the new ones, will spontaneously become speaking ones. The new ones will follow the trend and the atmosphere in the meeting. They will pick up the habit of speaking easily. We must endeavor to do this because it is not just for ourselves but for the benefit of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>We have to overthrow the old, traditional, and unscriptural way of meeting. Brother Nee told us that the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting with one person speaking and the others listening was a waste, that it was not worthwhile to maintain, and that it was according to the customs of the nations (see <em>Church Affairs,</em> pp. 68-75, 85-86). Although we have to overthrow this practice, it is hard to overthrow because it is our habit. If we give up this habit and do not have anything to replace it, we will have nothing. It seems that we cannot live or survive as a Christian without this traditional way of meeting. This is why we need a new start in the recovery, and this new start depends on us. If we would pick up the burden to practice this fellowship in order to be the speaking ones in our meetings, a habit will be built up among us. How could anyone take away the speaking of English from the people of the United States? It is impossible because this has been founded and built up as a habit among them. We also need such a foundation of speaking Christ in all our meetings. If not within five years, perhaps within ten years, such a habit will be prevailing among us. Then even the unbelievers will have their concept changed concerning the Christian meeting. Most of the unbelievers today have the concept that a Christian meeting is to have a pastor or a preacher speak while all the others listen to him. Even before they get saved, they already have this concept. We have to overthrow this practice and build up another habit.</p>
<p>All of us can speak. We have the Bible, a hymnal, the Life-study Messages, and other spiritual publications to speak. If we spoke a Life-study Message together, this would make the best message full of the divine riches and the refreshing utterances. We should not merely read the message but speak it, and this speaking should not be an individual speaking but a corporate speaking. May we all rise up to pick up the burden to be the speaking ones in our meetings. May we be desperate to practice speaking and to build up a habit of speaking. This is a great thing for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, for His move on this earth, and this practice will really build up every saint in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALWAYS HAVING SOMETHING TO SPEAK<br />
IN ALL THE MEETINGS AS A FREEWILL OFFERING<br />
TO GOD AND TO THE AUDIENCE</h2>
<p>We should always have something to speak in all the meetings as a freewill offering to God and to the audience (1 Cor. 14:26 and note 1). In all our meetings we should not speak merely out of being forced or compelled to speak. Our speaking should be an offering of our free will to God for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their enlightening, nourishing, and building up.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
