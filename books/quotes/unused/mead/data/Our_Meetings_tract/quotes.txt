[1]  From the church s beginning on the day of Pentecost, fifty days after our Lord s resurrection, the believers have been gathered together as the church Acts 2:41-45 .
[2]  And our meetings are based more on function than on form; that is, we conduct our meetings not according to ritual and tradition but for the sake of furthering the edification of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ.
[3]  In partaking of the Lord s table, we discern the body, as the apostle Paul exhorts us to do 1 Cor 11:29 ; that is, we examine ourselves concerning the Lord s Body, asking whether we are divisive individually or whether our meeting is a meeting in division.
