<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Regenerating All His Believers</H2><P>In the process of resurrection He regenerated all His believers chosen by God in eternity past (1 Pet. 1:3) by dispensing the divine life to the believers in Christ (John 3:15), germinating all believers in Christ through regeneration (John 3:5-6), and washing away all the old things from the regenerated believers (Titus 3:5). Resurrection was a great process.</P><P>Titus 3:5 says that our God saved us through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Spirit. Note 4 of this verse in the Recovery Version says:</P><blockquote>The Greek word for regeneration is different from that for regenerated in 1 Pet. 1:23. The only other place this word is used is Matt. 19:28, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium (see note 1 there). Here it refers to a change from one state to another. Being born again is the commencing of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God's new creation, a process that makes us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life. Baptism (Rom. 6:3-5), the putting off of the old man, the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24; Col. 3:9-11), and transformation by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) are all related to this wonderful process. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new&#151;the divine essence of the new man&#151;into our being. In this is a passing from our old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation. Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are working in us continually throughout our life until the completion of the new creation.</blockquote>
