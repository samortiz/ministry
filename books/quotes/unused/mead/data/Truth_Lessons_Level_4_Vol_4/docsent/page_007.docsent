   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the consummation of the resurrection that we partake of in God s New Testimony economy through the redemption and salvation we enjoy in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This resurrection begins with the enlivening of our dead spirit and is completed with the transfiguration of our corruptible body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In between is the process of the metabolic transformation of our fallen soul by Christ as the life-giving Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 , who is the reality of resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit; incorruption is the consequence of life saturating our body Rom 8:11 .</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 2 Corinthians 5:4 Paul says, We who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is mortal denotes our mortal body 4:11; Rom 8:11; 1 Cor 15:53 .</S>
