   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIZE OF THE TEMPLE AND THE SEPARATE AREA IN FRONT OF IT AND BEHIND IT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ezekiel 41:13-15 gives us the size of the temple and the separate area in front of it and behind it: So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long; also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The temple is one hundred cubits long, and the width of the front of the temple and of the separate area along the east side totals one hundred cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The width of the nave is twenty cubits vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The thickness of the two sides of the wall is twelve cubits altogether, with each side six cubits v. 5 . The width of the side chambers is four cubits on each side, altogether eight cubits v. 5 . The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers is five cubits on each side, altogether ten cubits v. 9 . The width of the space left along the side chambers is five cubits on both sides, altogether ten cubits v. 9 . When we add all these, we have sixty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The separate area between the side chambers belonging to the temple and the outer chambers is twenty cubits in width on both sides of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we add all these together, we have one hundred cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This makes a square with one hundred cubits on each side, signifying that Christ is absolutely perfect, upright, complete, and plentiful as the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The width of the inner court, the front of the temple, and the area along the east side, is one hundred cubits and its length is also one hundred cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, this area, which has the altar as its center, is also a square with one hundred cubits on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a further indication that Christ is perfect, upright, and complete and that He is fully qualified to be used by God to accomplish His work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The separate area with the building at the back and its wall is one hundred cubits long v. 13 . The width of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side, is also one hundred cubits v. 15 . Here at the back of the temple we have another square with one hundred cubits on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is yet another indication that Christ is perfect, upright, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is more than sufficient to meet all the needs of both God and man with an abundant surplus remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The surplus of Christ is surely plentiful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This marvelous arrangement reveals the wisdom of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Altogether we have three pieces of land, all of which are one hundred cubits square.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that in the Triune God there is one hundred times of complete squares and one hundred times of plentiful surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would ask you to use the diagram of the plot plan on page 215 to consider the whole area of the temple and of the inner and outer courts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Added together, the length of the east gate leading to the outer court 40:6-16 and the length of the east gate leading to the inner court vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>32-34 equal one hundred cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The outer court is also a hundred cubits long from the outer gate to the inner gate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The inner court is one hundred cubits long; the temple itself is one hundred cubits long; and the length of the separate area and the building at the back is also one hundred cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By adding these five parts, we have a total of five hundred cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This refers to the situation of Christ before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the gate He is one hundred percent perfect; as the outer court He is one hundred percent perfect; as the inner court He is one hundred percent perfect; as the temple itself He is one hundred percent perfect; and as the plentiful surplus He is also one hundred percent perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ, who is absolutely perfect in every way, is one hundred times five.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to remember that five is the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, for us Christ bears complete responsibility before God a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a picture of the completeness, uprightness, and surplus of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His completeness, uprightness, and surplus are perfect, being derived from God and being in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In bearing responsibility for us before God, Christ is a whole, perfect, and flawless testimony for God.</S>
