<h2 class=head1>THE SUPPLY OF THE LORD’S HUMANITY</h2><p>Now we must go on to see the supply of the Lord’s humanity in Hebrews 2. “Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil; and might release those who through fear of death through all their life were held in slavery. For assuredly He does not take hold of angels, but He takes hold of the seed of Abraham. Wherefore He ought to be made like His brothers in all things, that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For in that He has suffered, being tried, He is able to help those who are being tried” (Heb. 2:14-18).<p>The Lord Jesus partook of our blood and flesh that He might destroy the Devil who has the might of death. The deliverance is here, the propitiation is here, and the help is here. The word “help” is not adequate. In Greek it means to support, to render a certain kind of aid, or to supply. If we masticate the humanity of Jesus all the time, it will afford us a kind of aid, help, and supply. Whatever we need, we will receive. Jesus is able to succor those who are being tempted.<p>Christians today have the religious concept that Jesus is the almighty Savior, yet they do not realize that He is so human, and they do not know how to appreciate His humanity. But of all the offerings, the meal offering is the most important. Only this offering can satisfy God and be a kind of memorial to Him, and only this offering can afford a living for the priesthood. We need to see something of Christ as the meal offering. This matter is greatly neglected in today’s Christianity. May the Lord recover the proper humanity of Jesus. This is all we need today. So many Christians have been praying for power from on high, but look at their situation. Perhaps five years ago they received the so-called power from on high, but what about their life today? Even this power didn’t deliver them from their temper. It seems the more we look to the Lord as the mighty Savior to deliver us from our temper, the more temper we have. The Lord Jesus will hardly answer this kind of prayer. But if we simply learn to enjoy Christ as the meal offering and masticate His humanity all day long, we will see what will happen to our temper. We will receive succor, aid, support, and supply from the humanity of Jesus.<h2 class=head1>THE SHORTAGE OF THE PROPER HUMANITY</h2><p>Medical doctors tell us that if we have a certain kind of disease, it indicates that we are short of life supply or vitamins. If you are short of life supply, surely you will have a kind of disease. In my native country, there was a village where the people seemed to lose their sight in the evenings. This was because of a kind of disease. They had no knowledge concerning vitamins to realize that they had a shortage of vitamin A, but they lived on the seashore and caught great quantities of a certain kind of fish. When they began to eat the liver of that fish, they were healed. Of course, we know today that that kind of fish liver is very high in vitamin A. The point is this: if we are short of vitamin A and lose our sight, and then we kneel down to pray to the almighty Savior to heal us, it will not work. The more we pray in that way, the more we will lose our sight. We simply need to eat a large amount of a certain kind of fish liver. What is the “fish liver” for us today? That is the meal offering, the humanity of Jesus.<p>To lose our temper easily is a kind of disease. It comes from the shortage of Christ’s humanity. If we will masticate the humanity of Jesus just like the people in that village ate the fish liver, we will be healed spontaneously. It is so clear in the Bible that we need the Lord’s humanity as our meal offering. But we have not seen it. We have been reading the Scriptures for years, and still we have not seen it, simply because we are veiled by our natural concepts. We must forget our natural concepts and come to the pure Word without any kind of religious understanding. If we do this, we will see the importance of Christ’s humanity in the Bible.
