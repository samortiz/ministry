<h2 class=head3>2. Meeting in the House of Prisca and Aquila</h2><p>[The church in Rome met in the house of Prisca and Aquila. In Romans 16:3-5a Paul says, “Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the nations; and greet the church in their house.’’ The church in their house was the church in Rome. There were not two churches in Rome, one called the church in Rome and another which met in the house of Aquila and Prisca. The church in Rome simply met in the house of this couple, so there was a church in their house.<p>On the one hand, this couple was for all the churches; on the other hand, they were for their local church in particular. When they were living in Ephesus (Acts 18:18-19), the church in Ephesus was in their house (1 Cor. 16:19). When they were in Rome, the church in Rome met in their house. Therefore, the church in Rome could be called the church in their house.]<h2 class=head1>IV. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ESTABLISHED LOCAL CHURCHES</h2><p>[The government of the church is very simple. The apostles go out and preach the gospel to establish the churches. Then they select the more mature believers and appoint them to be elders to shepherd, to take care of, a local church. The elders should take care of the churches according to the apostles’ teaching. Because all the churches are established by the apostles, and the elders are selected and appointed in different localities by the apostles, in taking care of the churches all the elders should take the word of the apostles.]<p>The apostleship is universal and the eldership is local. Before Paul and Barnabas were sent out from the church in Antioch, they were teachers and prophets in that locality, being local (Acts 13:1). When they were set apart and sent out by the Holy Spirit, they became apostles, the sent ones for the universal church (Acts 13:2-4). Although their apostleship was universal, the churches they established were local.<p>[Since it is the apostles who appoint the elders, the apostles are above the elders (Acts 14:23). Because all the elders in the local churches are established and appointed by the apostles, the apostles are over the elders.]<p>[The eldership is local, and it is under the apostleship. First Timothy 5:19-20 indicates that an accusation against an elder should be made to the apostles. This shows that the elders are under the apostles.] It is not true that once the eldership is established, the elders are divorced from the apostles. This is illogical and impossible. They are still under the leading and guiding of the apostles who raised them up and appointed them to their office. They should always stay in fellowship with these apostles to ensure that the churches established by the apostles will stay healthy in the Lord.
