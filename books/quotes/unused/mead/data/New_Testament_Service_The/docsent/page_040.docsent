   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APPLICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, there is another portion in Matthew 17, a portion describing another event which occurred a short time after the transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the half-shekel came to Peter and said, Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He says, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But that we may not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for Me and you Matt 17:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At this time, Jesus and His disciples were within a house, and a poll-tax collector came.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As always, Peter took the lead and confronted this man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he had not taken the lead, I do not think that he would have gotten himself so involved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The tax collector asked Peter if his teacher paid the half-shekel for the poll tax.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This half-shekel was the offering given to God by all His people for the expenses of maintaining the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In both Exodus 30:11-16 and Nehemiah 10:32-33, the record of this regulation is given.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every Israelite was required to pay this half-shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once again, Peter was too quick to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the tax collector asked Peter if Jesus paid the half-shekel, immediately Peter answered, Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Did Peter not receive the revelation in chapter sixteen?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Did he not see the transfiguration on the Mount?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The central point of that revelation and of that vision of transfiguration was that Christ was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is My beloved Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The half-shekel was collected for keeping the house of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Should then the Son of the Father pay the half-shekel?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, Peter was careless, not paying attention to what had been revealed to him, nor to what he had seen in the vision of the transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What he did was to keep the tradition!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Tradition dictated that every Israelite pay the tribute.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter s thinking was that since Jesus was an Israelite, surely He must pay.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He answered the question based upon traditional knowledge, forgetting what he had seen and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He saw the vision, and he heard the voice, but he did not apply what he saw and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times we may have seen the vision, and we may even have heard the voice, but we simply do not apply what we have seen and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason we will not apply it is that we are still so traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Have you seen that all the members of the church should function?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Surely we all will answer, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then why do you not apply this vision?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since you have seen that all the members of the church need to function, why do you not function?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a thing happens because, on the one hand, you have seen the vision, but, on the other hand, you are still in the old tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes in the meetings we are on the Mount; we have really seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when we get home, the tax collector meets us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We feel that we still remember what we have seen, but the Holy Spirit sends the tax collector in an unexpected way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a test to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the Lord Jesus had warned Peter that he would be put on the test by the coming of a tax collector before the tax collector came, I believe Peter would not have been so careless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many times, however, the Lord does not give us any forewarning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am sure that Peter still rejoiced concerning what he had seen on the Mount.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He may have said, Hallelujah, I have seen that it is a matter of Jesus only!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the tax collector came.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peter may have said to himself, Surely we are Israelites and so is He.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As an Israelite, He would pay.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the commandment of Moses, and this is the regulation of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we see that we may have seen the vision, but when we are put on the test, it is a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Merely to be clear concerning the vision is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to be tested, and we need to learn how to apply what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What should Peter have done when he was asked this question by the tax collector?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He should not have answered according to tradition, because he had seen the vision and heard the voice from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He should have answered according to what he had seen and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peter, however, was careless.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He immediately answered according to his traditional knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then he turned and entered the house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I believe his intention was to tell the Lord that He must pay the tribute.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord Jesus, however, prevented him from saying anything by asking him a question first.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Of course, Peter answered that it should be from strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord Jesus replied, Then the sons are free.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He said, in effect, Do you not know that I am the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Did you not hear the voice saying that I am the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then why did you tell the tax collector that I would pay?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Peter was caught.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He erred by forgetting what he saw in the vision and heard from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He answered in the old way, in the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He made the mistake innocently.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Nevertheless, whether it was innocently or otherwise, Peter made a great mistake.</S>
