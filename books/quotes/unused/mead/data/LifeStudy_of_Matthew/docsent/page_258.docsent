   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE SEVENTY-ONE MAN S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 27 we see a contrast between man s unrighteousness and God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the crucifixion of Christ, man s unrighteousness turns into God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see this matter very clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>MAN S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we pointed out in the previous message, the Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the first three hours, He was dealt with by man, and during the second three hours, He was dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything man did to the Lord Jesus in chapter twenty-seven was unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only was Pilate unrighteous toward the Lord Jesus, but the Jewish leaders were also unrighteous toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They arrested Christ in an unrighteous way, and they also judged and bound Him in an unrighteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything the religious leaders did to the Lord was unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Judas, of course, was also unrighteous in betraying the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Roman soldiers also treated Him unrighteously.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their mocking, spitting, and beating were unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, they unrighteously forced Simon of Cyrene to bear the Lord s cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, on man s side, there was nothing righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>MAN S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS TURNING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>INTO GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise God that man s unrighteousness turned into God s righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man could only go so far.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He could mistreat the Lord and put Him on the cross as the Passover Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything man did to the Lord Jesus set the stage for God s righteousness to come in. On man s side, everything was black, but on God s side, everything was white.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On man s side, everything was unrighteous, but on God s side, everything was righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man s unrighteousness prepared the way for God s righteousness to be fully manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way, man s unrighteousness turned into God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the crucifixion of Christ, man s unrighteousness was fully exposed; yet it brought in God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the killing of Christ was the first way through which man s unrighteousness brought in God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CHRIST EXPOSING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>MAN S UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, this was not the basic way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The basic way in which man s unrighteousness turned into God s righteousness was through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In turning man s unrighteousness into God s righteousness, Christ first exposed man s unrighteousness to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In all of human history there has not been a case in which man s unrighteousness has been as totally exposed as in the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we all know, there is unrighteousness in the judicial branch of any earthly government.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But no earthly court has seen as much unrighteousness as was exposed in the case of the trial and crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus completely exposed human unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have seen that the Lord s betrayal at the hands of Judas was unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The elders, the high priests, and the Sanhedrin all were unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the case of the crucifixion of Christ was unique in being filled with unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nearly everyone involved with His case was unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In every way and in every aspect, it was unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The very presence of Christ in this unrighteous situation was a full exposure of man s unrighteousness.</S>
