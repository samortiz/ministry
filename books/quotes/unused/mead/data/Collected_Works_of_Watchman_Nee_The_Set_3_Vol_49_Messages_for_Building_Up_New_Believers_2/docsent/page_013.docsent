   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDIX:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PASSING OUT TRACTS A. No Time Limit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the past two to three hundred years, the Lord has used tracts in a particular way to save many people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One thing special about winning people with tracts is that tracts are not limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you try to testify with your mouth, you are restricted by time and personnel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You cannot speak twenty-four hours a day, and your audience may not be available all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may be preaching a wonderful message, but the audience may not be there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, tracts are not limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You can pass out tracts any time of the day, and men can receive and read your tracts any time of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today many people do not have the time to come to our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But tracts are not limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can give them out to people who are walking on the streets, who are cooking in their kitchens, or who are working in their offices.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the first convenience that tracts afford.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Tracts Can Convey the Gospel in Full</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people are very zealous in testifying for the Lord and leading men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, their knowledge is limited and their words are lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They cannot convey the gospel message adequately and fully.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition to leading men to Christ through other means, a new believer has to do his best to select some good tracts in his spare time and pass them out to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will enable him to do what he himself could not do otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. Tracts Not Being Affected by Human Factors</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is another advantage to using tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In preaching the gospel, sometimes we feel too shy to use strong words in front of people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Tracts do not have this inconvenience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They can go to anyone and say anything they want.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A living preacher is often restricted by circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the preaching of the tracts is not affected by any human factors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>New believers should learn to sow seeds with the tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>D. Passing Out Tracts Being a Way of Sowing</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another advantage of passing out tracts is that one can sow anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Old Testament says that we should sow our seed in many waters Num 24:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It takes a considerable effort to speak to three, five, or ten persons together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But there is no difficulty in passing out a thousand, two thousand, or three thousand tracts a day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If one person can be saved out of the thousand tracts we pass out, this is wonderful enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>New believers should learn to pass out tracts in large quantities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>E. God Saving Men through Tracts</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has indeed used tracts to save people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I know of some people who slip tracts under doors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Others drop them into mailboxes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I remember an incident in which a person received a tract and then threw it away on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another person, who had a nail stuck in his shoe, was looking for something to cushion his foot.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He picked up the tract and stuffed it in his shoe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He returned home and began to mend his shoe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then he saw the tract and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are numerous similar cases of people being saved by tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of these cases are actually quite marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>F. Much Prayer and Dedication of Heart</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A newly saved brother always should have tracts ready in his pockets, and he should pass them out when he is free.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Like the work of leading men to Christ, we should do this with much prayer and dedication of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While we are passing out tracts, we can speak a word or two to others or we can remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Either way is good.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a new believer practices this, he will receive great benefit from it.</S>
