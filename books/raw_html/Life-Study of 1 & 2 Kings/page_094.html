<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REIGNS OF MANASSEH,<br>AMON, AND JOSIAH OVER JUDAH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 21:1&#151;23:30</H1><P>In this message we will first consider the reigns of Manasseh, Amon, and Josiah over Judah and then say a word concerning the essence of the typology in the books of history in the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE REIGN OF MANASSEH</H2><P>The record of the reign of Manasseh is found in 21:1-18.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Reigning for Fifty-five Years</H2><P>At the age of twelve, Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, began to reign over Judah and reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem (v. 1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Doing What Was Evil in the Sight of Jehovah</H2><P>Manasseh did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah, like the abominations of the nations. He rebuilt the high places which his father had destroyed and raised up altars to Baal, as Ahab king of Israel had done. Manasseh worshipped all the host of heaven and built altars in the house of Jehovah and altars to all the host of heaven in both courts of the house of Jehovah. Furthermore, he burned his son as a sacrifice to an idol, practiced soothsaying and enchantments, appointed mediums and spiritists, put the engraved image of the Asherah in the temple, and shed very much innocent blood. Manasseh led the people of Judah astray to do more evil than the nations, not listening to the law given through Moses and doing what was evil in the sight of Jehovah beyond measure and provoking Him to anger (vv. 2-9, 15-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Bringing Evil upon Jerusalem and Judah</H2><P>Because of all that Manasseh did, Jehovah would then bring evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, as He had done over Israel and the house of Ahab. He would wipe Jerusalem like a pan and deliver the people into the hand of their enemies (vv. 10-14).</P><P>Hezekiah was the best king and his son Manasseh was the worst. It is hard to explain how such a good king could have such an evil son. It was Manasseh's sin in particular that caused God to determine no longer to tolerate the people but to destroy the temple, devastate the holy land, and send the people away into captivity. With the reign of Manasseh God's toleration reached its limit, and He gave up the holy people, the holy temple, the holy city, and the holy land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Manasseh Sleeping with His Fathers</H2><P>Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, and Amon his son reigned in his place (vv. 17-18).</P>
