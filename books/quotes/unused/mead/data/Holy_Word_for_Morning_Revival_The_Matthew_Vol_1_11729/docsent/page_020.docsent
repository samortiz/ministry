   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the sequence of the blessings in Matthew 5, being pure in heart comes after the showing of mercy to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to be pure in heart toward God, you must be strict in dealing with yourself and merciful in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As far as logic is concerned, there seems to be no reason for this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But our practical experience proves that it is so.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are righteous with ourselves and merciful with others, we see God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we are loose with ourselves and condemn others, our eyes are absolutely blind, and we cannot see God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A pure heart toward God comes only from strict dealings with yourself and merciful dealings with others.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>8 1 To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory 1 Cor 10:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our spirit is the organ by which we receive Christ John 1:12; 3:6 , whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows 13:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be poor in spirit, empty in our spirit, that we may receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Also, we need to be pure, single, in our heart that Christ may grow in us without frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>8 2 If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we will see God.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>9 1 Our Father is the God of peace Rom 15:33; 16:20 , having a peaceful life with a peaceful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As those born of Him, if we would be peacemakers, we must walk in His divine life and according to His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way we will express His life and nature and be called the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>10 1 The whole world lies in the evil one 1 John 5:19 and is filled with unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, we will be persecuted for the sake of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the sake of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to pay a price for the righteousness that we seek.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>10 2 If we seek for righteousness at a cost, the kingdom of the heavens becomes ours: we are in its reality now, and we will be rewarded with its manifestation in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>11 1 When we live a life for the kingdom of the heavens, in the spiritual nature of the kingdom and according to the heavenly principles of the kingdom, we are reproached, persecuted, and evilly spoken of, mostly by the religious people, who hold to their traditional religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Jewish religionists did all these things to the apostles in the early days of the kingdom of the heavens Acts 5:41; 13:45, 50; 2 Cor 6:8; Rom 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>11 2 The persecution in v. 10 is for the sake of righteousness, i.e., is due to our seeking for righteousness, whereas the persecution in v. 11 is directly because of Christ, the new King, i.e., because of our following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>12 1 This reward of the ninth blessing indicates that the results of the foregoing eight blessings also are rewards.</S>
