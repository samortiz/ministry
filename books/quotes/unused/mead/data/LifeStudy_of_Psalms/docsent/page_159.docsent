   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. A SONG OF LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE MELODY OF LILIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The superscription of this psalm calls it "a Song of Love," and this love is feminine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is the love between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This love makes us His love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that if we are those who love the Lord, we eventually become His love, His favorite.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just as He is our love, so we become His love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The subject of this psalm is love, and the tune, the melody, is called "lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here both love and lilies refer to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every lover of the Lord Jesus is feminine and is also a lily.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A lily denotes a pure, simple, single life of trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our love for the Lord Jesus should be a love full of affection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not only have a life of purity and simplicity as signified by the lily, but we should always have an affectionate feeling toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Psalm 45, we all need to have a pure life with an affectionate love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John Nelson Darby, who lived to be eighty-four and never married, had such a love full of affection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One night in his old age, he was staying alone in a hotel, and at bedtime he said, "Lord, I still love You."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I read about this, I was deeply touched, desiring to have such an affectionate love for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now I can testify that, as an elderly person, I love Him much more than I did when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Recently I had a time of intimate, affectionate prayer to the Lord regarding a certain matter, and in my prayer I told Him, "Lord Jesus, I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As I was praying, I fell in love with the Lord Jesus once again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A PSALM OVERFLOWING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>WITH A GOOD MATTER CONCERNING THE KING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BY THE TONGUE AS THE PEN OF A READY WRITER</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 1 says, "My heart overflows with a good matter;/I speak what I have composed concerning the King./My tongue is the pen of a ready writer."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse says that the psalmist's heart overflows; we may also say the psalm overflows.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two are actually the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For the psalmist's tongue to be the pen of a ready writer means that the psalmist does not need to write a draft of what will be spoken concerning the King.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Real love for the King makes a draft unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regarding many things we may need to write a draft, but to write a draft of what we want to say to someone we love would be altogether mechanical; it would not be real.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have an affectionate love for the Lord Jesus, we will have the tongue of a ready writer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of needing to write a draft, we will be ready to write our love and our praise.</S>
