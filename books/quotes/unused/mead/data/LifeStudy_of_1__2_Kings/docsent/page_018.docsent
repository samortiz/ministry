   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. His Dominion Extending</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>from the Great River Euphrates</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to the Land of the Philistines</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and to the Border of Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Solomon's dominion extended from the great river Euphrates to the land of the Philistines at the seashore of the Mediterranean and to the border of Egypt as the fulfillment of the promise of God to His elect Israel Gen 15:18; Exo 23:31; Deut 11:24 , and all the nations brought tribute to him 1 Kings 4:21, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was a positive factor for the people to regard Solomon and accept him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>C. The Twelve Tribes Providing</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>the Daily Necessities of Him and His Vast Family</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The twelve tribes of Israel provided the daily necessities of Solomon and his vast family vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>22-23, 27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This family included Solomon's one thousand wives and concubines with all their dependents.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually the requirement to provide these daily necessities became a factor in the people's rejection of Solomon, a "kingly robber."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Solomon lost the kingdom partly due to his indulgence in lust and idol worship and partly because the people were burdened by the need to provide for Solomon's vast family.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>D. His Army</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Solomon's army included 40,000 horses for his chariots and 12,000 cavalrymen v. 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>E. His God-given Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Making Him Great in the World in His Days</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verses 29 through 34 we see that Solomon's God-given wisdom made him great in the world in his days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God gave him very much understanding and largeness of heart, even as the sand on the seashore v. 29 . Solomon, therefore, had a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to verses 30 and 31 his wisdom surpassed that of all the wise men of the east and of Egypt, including Ethan Psa 89 title and Heman Psa 88 title , the Ezrahites.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In his wisdom Solomon spoke 3,000 proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs 1 Kings 4:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, he discoursed about trees, from the largest, the cedar in Lebanon, to the smallest, the hyssop out of the wall; he discoursed also about animals, birds, creeping things, and fish v. 33 . From all the peoples men came to hear the wisdom of Solomon and from all the kings who had heard of his wisdom v. 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Solomon's wisdom was absolutely in the physical realm, without any spiritual element.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His wisdom was altogether different from the wisdom of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul's wisdom was a spiritual wisdom concerning Christ making His home in our hearts Eph 3:17 , our walking and having our being according to the spirit Rom 8:4 , and the two spirits the divine Spirit and the human spirit v. 16 . Today, God the Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the indwelling Spirit, the anointing Spirit, the revealing Spirit, and the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
