   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING THE TESTIMONY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the testimony of God, and the Holy Spirit is the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Holy Spirit brought Christ into the believers and constituted them as the church, the church became the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is referred to in John 15:26-27; Acts 1:8; and Revelation 1:9; 2:13; 12:17; and 19:10.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before His death and after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus told the disciples that the Holy Spirit would come upon them and that they would be His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the Holy Spirit has wrought Christ into us, we should live out and express the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is to testify of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. The Church Being</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>the Body of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>the Embodiment of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>and Therefore the Testimony of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Corinthians 12:12 and Ephesians 4:12-13 show us that the church is the Body of Christ, the embodiment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the church is the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nothing expresses a person and testifies of the person more than his body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our body is our most expressive aspect of our being to other people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Similarly, the church, the Body of Christ, expresses and testifies of Christ the most.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the church, the Body of Christ, no one can know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is a mystery; He is abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But with the church, He is no longer abstract; He is very real.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of being a mystery, He has an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is very clear in the books of 1 Corinthians and Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the condition of the church is right, when a person touches the church, he touches Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. The Church Testifying concerning Christ 1 As the One Who Contains</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the Fullness of the Godhead and</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is United with Man John 1:1, 14; 1 John 4:2 2 As the One Who Has</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Overcome Satan John 14:30 3 As the One</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who Is without Sin 2 Corinthians 5:21 4 As the One Who Has</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Overcome Death Acts 2:24 5 As the One Who Has</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Overcome the World John 17:14, 16 6 As the One Who Is</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not Defiled by Idolatry Matthew 4:9-10 7 As the One Who Has</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No Part in Satan s Kingdom John 18:36 8 As the One</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who Has Overcome Everything and</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thereby Completely Expresses and Glorifies God</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 12:28; 17:1, 4</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church testifies concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Simply speaking, there are two important aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, there is the aspect in relation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the embodiment of God, Christ is absolutely related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, there is the aspect in relation to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the One who destroyed Satan, Christ is absolutely not related to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not long after he was created, the first Adam was corrupted by Satan; he was alienated from God on the one hand and united with Satan on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Due to the union of Satan with the first Adam, Satan brought in sin, death, the world, idols, and the authority of Satan, which is Satan s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These five items along with Satan himself constitute a total of six items.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the first Adam was cut off from God and united with Satan, he also was united with the items that belong to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the first Adam there was Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and the authority of Satan, which is Satan s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Satan entered in Genesis 3, sin also entered.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In chapter 4, death entered, and the world also entered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In chapter 5, death entered in a full way, and in chapter 6, the world was completely corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then in chapter 11, idols came in at Babel, as did the authority of Satan, Satan s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At that time, mankind was filled with Satan and the things of Satan; God and the things of God had no place within fallen human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Fallen man was separated from God and completely united with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the Lord came to the earth, His situation was exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, He was completely united with God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God was in Him, and He also brought God into man, causing God to be united with man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the other hand, He was completely separated from Satan, and Satan had nothing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Satan had no ground in Him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Concerning sin, He knew no sin and even was without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was One who set Himself far apart from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Concerning death, He overcame death and could not be held by death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He did not have even the precursor of death, that is, weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He had no weakness of the body, nor weakness of the mind, nor weakness of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is because in Him there was no death or even the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was One who transcended death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Wherever He is, there is resurrection; wherever He is, there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Death had no ground in Him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He also did not have the world.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The world could not defile Him, much less usurp Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The world had no ground in Him; He was completely transcendent over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He was in the world but not of the world; He was in the world but not defiled by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Moreover, He did not have idols.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Satan even placed the kingdoms of the world and their glory before Him, trying to entice Him to worship him, but He refused.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Idols had no ground in Him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He also was not defiled by Satan s authority and had no part in Satan s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was completely separated from the things of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>None of these things could be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then through death and resurrection He brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He entered into glory, and He manifested God, completely expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He was such a One.</S>
