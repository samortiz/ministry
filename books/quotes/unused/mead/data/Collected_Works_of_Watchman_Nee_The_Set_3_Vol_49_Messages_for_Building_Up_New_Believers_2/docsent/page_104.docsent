   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paying Attention to Their Repentance</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let them know the meaning of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must pay attention to the matter of their repentance and then bring them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After some time you should ask them to receive the Lord sincerely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then bring them to the church and let them be a part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this way you will lead your children to the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. The Atmosphere in the Family Being Love</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ninth, the atmosphere in the family should be one of love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some become psychologically abnormal or withdrawn because they do not have love at home.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way a child grows up depends on the atmosphere in his family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a child does not receive any loving nurturing as he grows up, he will become stubborn, individualistic, and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people cannot get along with others in their adult life because they did not experience love in the family as a child.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They saw only quarrels, arguments, and fights in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Children from such families grow up abnormally.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who come from such abnormal families surely grow up to be lonely people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They will be antagonistic toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because they feel inferior in their heart, they try to boost their self-image by considering themselves better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All those who have an inferiority complex have a tendency to exalt themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is their means of offsetting their own inferiority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many bad elements in society such as robbers and rebels come from families which are void of love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their personality becomes warped, and they turn against their fellow man when they grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they come to the church, they bring their problems with them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I feel that half of the work of the church can be done by good parents.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But this work falls upon our shoulders today because there are few good parents.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>New believers should see that they should treat their children in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A family must be filled with an atmosphere of love and tenderness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There must be genuine love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Children who grow up from such families will become normal persons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Parents must learn to be friends to their children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Never allow your children to distance themselves from you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never make yourself unapproachable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please remember that friendship is built upon communication; it does not come by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must learn to approach your children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Be happy to help them so that they will tell you when they encounter problems and seek your counsel when they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They should not go to others when they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They should be able to tell you their successes as well as their failures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You should be their good friend, the approachable and helpful one to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They should look to you when they are weak and fellowship with you when they are successful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to be friends to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When they are weak, they should be able to come to us for help.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not be a judge on the throne but a help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should be there whenever they need help, and we should be able to sit down with them and discuss problems with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They should be able to seek counsel from us as from friends.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a family the parents must earn so much trust from their children that they become their friends.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a parent will do this, he or she will have done the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have to learn this lesson from the time the children are young.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How dear and near your children are to you depends on how you treat them the first twenty years of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they are not near to you the first twenty years of their lives, they will not be near to you when they are thirty or forty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They will drift further and further away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many children do not like to be near their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are not friends to them and there is no sweet relationship between them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They go to their parents when they have problems in a way that resembles a criminal going before a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You must work to such an extent that your children will come and seek your advice first when they have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They must feel comfortable confiding in you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you can achieve this, you will find few problems in your family.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In fact, all problems will be solved.</S>
