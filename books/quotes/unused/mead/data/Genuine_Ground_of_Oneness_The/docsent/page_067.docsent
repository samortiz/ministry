   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED AND EXPRESSED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God; it symbolizes the Triune God embodied and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God the Father as the divine gold is embodied in Christ the Son and then is fully expressed through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The expression differs from the embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The embodiment must be uniquely one because our God is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the embodiment must be one stand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The expression, however, must be complete, and complete in God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Recall that seven is the number for completion in God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Throughout the centuries, God has been expressed in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason that the seven lamps signify the intensified Spirit as the expression of Christ in God's complete move.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the practical understanding of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Trinity is for the dispensing of God into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God, the divine Being, is firstly embodied in Christ and then expressed through the sevenfold, intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we have not only the Triune God; in the lampstand we have the Triune God substantially and solidly embodied and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gold has been formed into the solid stand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It once was just gold, but now it is the stand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The gold has been formed into a stand for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the stand, there is no way for God's purpose to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we have seen, this stand, which is a type of Christ, is expressed through the seven lamps signifying the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The seven Spirits of God are not separate from God; they are the seven eyes of God and of the Lamb, the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are also the seven eyes of the building stone Zech 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, they are the seven eyes with the redemption of Christ for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever these eyes look at people, people are redeemed and built into God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE REPRODUCTION OF CHRIST AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Exodus 25 the emphasis is on the stand, in Zechariah 4 the emphasis is on the lamps, and in Revelation 1 the emphasis is on the reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In both Exodus and Zechariah the lampstand is one, but in Revelation it has been reproduced and has become seven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Firstly, in Exodus the emphasis is on the stand on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Secondly, in Zechariah the emphasis is on the lamps on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, in Revelation both the stand and lamps, that is, both Christ and the Spirit, are reproduced as the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Exodus and Zechariah there are just seven lamps, but here in Revelation there are forty-nine lamps, for every lampstand has seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the one lampstand has become seven and the seven lamps have become forty-nine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The lampstands with their lamps in Revelation are the reproduction of Christ and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Christ is realized, He is the Spirit, and when the Spirit is realized, we have the churches as the reproduction.</S>
