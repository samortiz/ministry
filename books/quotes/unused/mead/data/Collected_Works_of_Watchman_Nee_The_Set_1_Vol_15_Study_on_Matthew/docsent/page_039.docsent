   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 16:"And He charged them not to make Him known."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who came because of His fame or because of their curiosity were not necessarily trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, the Lord did not want them to make Him known.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 17-21:Here the Gentiles are mentioned twice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, we can see that God has put the Israelites aside and has turned to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is to show in particular how God has turned to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaiah 42:1-4 seems to refer to the millennium, but here the Holy Spirit especially uses this prophecy that refers to the future to signify this age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 18:"Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the entire Bible, whenever it says "behold," its intention is to get people's special attention.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The servant mentioned after Isaiah 40 refers in particular to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is mentioned in Acts 8 is also a proof of this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Chosen" is a matter of will, "Beloved" is a matter of position, and "delight" is a matter of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 19:"He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How quiet is the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 20:"A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A bruised reed cannot produce a sound, yet the Lord will not break it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Gentiles are already bruised; they are like dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the Lord still turns to the Gentiles; He still expects to hear music from the bruised reeds.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Israelites often put flax in a bull horn and poured oil upon it, using it as a torch for their walking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the flax began to smoke, they quenched it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Smoking" Christians not only cannot help others to see, but actually prevent others from seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is easy for them to cause problems in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the Lord will not quench such ones; He still expects them to give light again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the strict interpretation of the Bible, this section refers to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to teaching, it also refers to us, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verses 22 through 32 form the third subsection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This section advances further than the previous section.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the first section the sign of the covenant was put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the second section the Pharisees plotted to destroy Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the third section they not only plotted to cause Jesus to suffer physically; they also blasphemed the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 22:"Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible speaks of different kinds of demons, such as a weak demon, an unclean demon, and a blind and dumb demon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In man's eyes, blindness and dumbness are of natural causes, but here we are told that they are caused by demon possession.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the demon is cast out, the symptom caused by the demon will also be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 23:"Is this not the Son of David?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that if this man is not the Son of David, then who is He?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From this we can see that the crowds in general had some faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"The Son of David" is an honorable and great title.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, such an address implies honor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This fits the significance of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 24:"But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"But" indicates that what was expressed here is just the opposite of the thought in the preceding verse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verses 25-26:Here the Lord Jesus brought up a very great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A demon casting out another demon simply means that one demon goes and another demon comes; it is merely a change of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is like a first robber coming to kidnap a person, and a second coming to negotiate for his release after the first one is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In essence, both are from the same source.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What the Lord spoke is concerning the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, that the Lord's authority was from God also is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A kingdom requires unity; otherwise, even the unlawful kingdom of Satan will not be able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 27:"And if I, by Beelzebul, cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore they shall be your judges."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the reason given by the Lord in His argument.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 28:"But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the outward manifestation of the kingdom of God?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The kingdom of God is the sovereignty of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Where the sovereignty of God is, there the demons have no sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are two main things in the Bible: one is the kingdom of God, and the other, the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The kingdom of God represents the sovereignty of God, whereas the Spirit of God represents the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has authority because there is power behind His authority; the Holy Spirit is the power of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How does the kingdom of God come?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It comes through power.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the King has power here, then the kingdom of God has come, because power is behind authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The casting out of the demons is the most important matter in the manifestation of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 29:"Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And then he will thoroughly plunder his house."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All spiritual works are open plundering, not secret stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the same in dealing with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The term "goods," strictly speaking, refers to all those who are demon possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Broadly speaking, it refers to all unbelievers 1 John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The "strong man" is Satan, a mighty one.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every demon possessed person and every unbeliever have become the goods in Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, he will guard them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord sees such power of Satan, so He plunders openly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To rescue an unbeliever, to release one who is demon possessed, or to heal one who is sick is to openly snatch people out of Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>One thing has to be done first before demons can be cast out, and that is to bind the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To plunder is to seize by force what someone is unwilling to give.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If one casts out demons by the ruler of the demons, he must first make peace with the ruler of the demons.</S>
