First Corinthians 1 was written to deal with the divisions in the church at Corinth. Verses 10-12 say, &ldquo;Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion. For it has been made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you. Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.&rdquo; Verse 10 says that we should speak the same thing. How can we all speak the same thing? In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul exhorts Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach different things but to speak the same thing, which is God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy is the only thing we can speak in the same way, and we must speak it in the same way. The entire book of 1 Corinthians reveals God&rsquo;s economy. The second half of chapter one says that Christ is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom (vv. 18-25), and this Christ has been given to us to be our righteousness for the past, sanctification for the present, and redemption for the future (vv. 26-31). Christ is all to us; this is God&rsquo;s economy, the one thing which we speak.</p><p>Some in Corinth said they were of Paul (v. 12). This is to follow Paul out of preference for him. Paul in his wisdom first condemned himself. It is as if he said, &ldquo;Do you say that you are of me, Paul? No, I reject and condemn this.&rdquo; Eventually, at the end of chapter three he said that he was of them (v. 22). Today someone may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I am of you.&rdquo; It seems that I should be happy because I have gained a follower to stand with me. However, this is wrong. Some liked to follow Apollos, and some liked to follow Cephas. Others were very proud and said, &ldquo;You are of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, but that is wrong. I do not belong to Paul, Apollos, or Cephas. I belong to Christ; I am of Christ.&rdquo; To say, &ldquo;I am of Christ&rdquo; in the way of division was to make themselves different, even superior. Paul condemned even this kind of saying. He asked, &ldquo;Is Christ divided?&rdquo; (1:13). This shows us that we must be right in following others. We cannot avoid having so many of us together, especially today as the modern conveniences make the globe small. Without gathering together, where is the Body life and where is the practice of the church? We have to come together. But we have many different persons with many backgrounds and cultures, so we have to be careful. If you follow the wrong person, you will damage yourself, and you will damage that person. Your following of a person wrongly is a destruction to the one whom you follow.</p><p>You must be careful in following any co-worker whom you appreciate and to whom you are attracted. If you do not appreciate a person, you will not follow him. First you appreciate someone, and then you are attracted to him. I have seen this among us here in America. I have spoken a word of love directly to these kinds of brothers. I have warned them to not do this kind of work. Wherever you go, you may become the superior one. You may be good; there is nothing wrong with that. You do have a capacity which might be higher than others&rsquo;. However, you should avoid doing a work to attract people to follow you. We all have to see this. Such a one who makes himself attractive is wrong already, and if you are attracted to follow him, you help him to be wrong. You destroy yourself, and you also destroy him. I have seen this. I warned one person more than five times. I said, &ldquo;Brother, you should not do this.&rdquo; I warned him in a very private way, but now my speaking is public. I have spoken publicly to you because there is such a danger that you may appreciate certain persons. I do not like to hear that you appreciate me, that you feel I am right and you follow me. If you appreciate the truths I have put out, I thank the Lord, but if you appreciate me, that is wrong. Be careful in following any co-worker whom you appreciate and to whom you are attracted. To be one with another co-worker in this way is wrong. Regardless of what the reason is for this oneness, you are wrong. We all are one. We do not have parties. Do not say, I am one with Brother So-and-so. To be one with anyone in particular is wrong. To be one with all the saints is right.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:10 speaks of being attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion. Concerning the word <i>attuned,</i> footnote 4 in the Recovery Version says:</p><p class="indent1">The same word in Greek that is translated <i>mending</i> in Matthew 4:21. It means <i>to repair, to restore, to adjust, to mend, making a broken thing thoroughly complete, joined perfectly together.</i> The Corinthian believers as a whole were divided, broken. They needed to be mended in order to be joined perfectly together that they might be in harmony, having the same mind and the same opinion to speak the same thing, that is, Christ and His cross.</p><p>To be attuned is to be joined together, as a piano is tuned to give a proper harmony and melody. Learn to be attuned, learn to be adjusted, and learn to be corrected. The harmony in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can be maintained only by dealing with the four &ldquo;gophers&rdquo;&mdash;ambition, pride, self-justification, and you yourself as the self, the natural man, your disposition by birth.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Word of Love to the Co-Workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
