   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. IN BLESSING AND PRAISING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 34 shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house in blessing and praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To bless God is to speak well about God, to talk about God in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To praise God is to give the honor and the glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Written After David Disguised Himself</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>as Being Insane before Abimelech</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is good to bless and praise God, but we should not forget that such a wonderful psalm was written after David put on a "mask."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He wrote this psalm after he disguised himself as being insane before Abimelech.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This story is recorded in 1 Samuel 21:10-15.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There David disguised himself before this Philistine king in order to escape from being killed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Because of God's Answer and Deliverance</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>David blessed and praised God because of God's answer and deliverance vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 1 he said, "I will bless Jehovah at all times;/His praise will continually be in my mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is good, but we have to remember the situation in which David said this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he disguised himself before Abimelech, he surely was not blessing God at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, 1 Samuel 21:13 says that David scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard to make Abimelech think that he was insane.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 2-6 say, "My soul makes its boast in Jehovah;/The lowly hear and they rejoice./Magnify Jehovah with me,/And let us exalt His name together./I sought Jehovah, and He answered me;/And He delivered me from all that terrified me./They looked to Him and were radiant;/And their faces will never be abashed./This poor man called out, and Jehovah heard;/And He saved him out of all his troubles."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>David said that Jehovah delivered him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But I would like to ask whether he was delivered out of the hand of Abimelech by Jehovah or whether he delivered himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>People may pray for a number of things, and then give all the credit to God when they are done.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, however, God did not do any one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, they prayed according to their own desire, and they did it on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes they might have even done something in a way to cheat people, but God surely did not cheat people for them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may pray for something, get what we prayed for, and then give the credit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is an insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this case the credit should not go to God but to us to become a debit.</S>
