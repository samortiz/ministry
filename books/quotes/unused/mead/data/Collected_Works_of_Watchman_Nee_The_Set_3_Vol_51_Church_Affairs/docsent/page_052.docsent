   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Responsible Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Using the Records for Oversight</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not every brother and sister will keep good records.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the beginning there will be things that are overlooked, and there will be difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You need to check the books to see who has been overlooked.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as you check, you will know by whom a certain person is being cared for or why he has not been cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether this job is done well or not depends on whether or not the worker has a good system.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With good records you can follow people closely.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The greatest use for records is in following up on people; it is not merely for recordkeeping.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Records can keep you informed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you need to check, you can find out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When someone is about to go to another city and wants to find out about the situation of a certain brother or some spiritual matters about him, they can give him an answer based on the records.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In another aspect, a responsible brother can often find out from the record book whether certain brothers or sisters have done what they should have done.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The responsible brothers in all the localities need to look up on their cards the names of these people frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With all these cards, you can divide and assign certain ones to be responsible for a certain number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to map out districts to find out who is in this district and who is in another district.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As responsible ones, the overseers need to oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your job is to oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Often you need to observe and ask, "Brother, have you done this?''</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Brother, have you taken care of that matter?''</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everywhere you go, you should ask, "What is the situation with the five brothers you have just finished visiting?''</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"What is the situation with the ten brothers you have just finished visiting?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you overlooked one and not visited him?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During this past week, have you visited all of them?''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the Brothers Serving Being the Way Today</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The responsible brothers should not merely preach a message once from the podium and then consider the job over.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is your responsibility to motivate the brothers who are with you to work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what you need to accomplish; this is the way today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do not have this, you have no way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If it were the same as before, with only one message preached per week, then everyone would be a preacher resting six days and working one day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God worked six days and rested one day; today we rest for six days and work one day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No wonder all of the preachers have become lazy!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, every one of you needs to labor every day, and you also have to cause all of the brothers to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers, the question is not whether you have done the work, but whether you have done it and have a way to cause others to do it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, your job is to do the work yourself, and on the other hand, it is to lay hold of others to do the work and then follow up on them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After you go down the mountain, I will write letters to ask you how many people you oversee in a week.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot have an elder who does not oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today if I hire ten laborers to work on the mountain and assign one brother to supervise, I do not expect the supervising brother to pick up a bamboo basket and carry it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I want him to supervise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He should not say, "Not one of the ten would carry it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I carried it.''</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the brother were to say this, he would not be worthy to be a supervisor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He would be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have the ability before God to make sure that others carry the load.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have the ability before God to make them work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you can cause six or ten brothers to serve, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not complain to us, saying, "Why should we stress this matter?''</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reason is that if we do not work in this way, there will be no church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may go out to preach to two or three people and may continue doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>True, you have your own work, and I cannot disregard it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet you also need to lead other brothers and sisters to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Never go astray from this way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you do, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to bring every brother into this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In matters pertaining to the gospel, let them preach the gospel and let them share in the care for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You need to take care of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You need to lead them to do the work and to take care of practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not turn matters over to them and consider the job done.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You need to follow up on them until the work is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You need to continue watching over them to see how they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You need to ask, "Do you have any problems?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do, I am here to help you solve them.''</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this way, you will see the church come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For the church to come forth, there is the need for people to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The day will come when you see the church serving and the entire church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then I would say that God's way of recovery on the earth has begun and then He will have the church on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Otherwise, Christianity has been taken captive to Babylon, and to this day it has not returned.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today there are still those who are passive.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today there are still some who are the mediatorial class on one side is God and on the other side is man with a mediatorial class in the middle through which people must pass before they can serve.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I do not know whether or not you have seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the whole problem.</S>
