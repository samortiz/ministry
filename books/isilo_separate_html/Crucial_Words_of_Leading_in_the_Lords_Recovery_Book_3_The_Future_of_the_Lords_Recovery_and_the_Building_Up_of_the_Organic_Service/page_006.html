<h1 class="title">BEING IN DISTRICTS AND GROUPS<br />
FOR CHURCH SERVICE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN OF THE LORD JESUS<br />
FORMING SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish (14:14-21). This was a great miracle. The Lord commanded the disciples to have the people sit down in groups by fifties and by hundreds (Mark 6:39-40; Luke 9:14-15). In this way the huge crowd was properly arranged. Since there were about five thousand men in the crowd, not including women and children, there were probably more than ten thousand people present.</p>
<p>When the crowd saw that the Lord Jesus was going to distribute the five loaves and two fish to the people, there could have been chaos if they had not been seated in groups; some of the children might have been trampled to death. Under these conditions it was important to arrange the people to sit down in groups. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to maintain order. There was no possibility for a chaotic situation when the crowd was seated.</p>
<p>In the church service there is the aspect of arranging the saints in groups. The Lord Jesus first gave the loaves to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowd, which was divided into groups. In this way God&rsquo;s miracle was manifested, but it was in an orderly fashion without any chaos. After feeding the crowd, the Lord Jesus commanded the disciples to gather up the leftovers (Matt. 14:20; Mark 6:43). This truly was a sweet service.</p>
<p>In Christianity arrangements are not made according to this principle. Rather, they do things in the way of organization. There is a difference between arranging and organizing. There is no organization in the church, but there are arrangements in church service. When the Lord Jesus distributed the bread, He did not call a meeting of the board of directors to elect a chairman. That is organization and is prevalent in Christianity. The church does not do things in this way; instead, the church makes arrangements according to practical needs. Such arrangements are living and are a tremendous help to the Lord&rsquo;s work. When the Lord distributed the bread, He commanded the disciples to have the people sit down in groups. Moreover, after they finished eating, He did not allow the disciples to end the service in a careless way. He had them pick up what was left over of the broken pieces. When they counted the baskets, there were twelve baskets full. The Lord caused the service to be done in an orderly way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF HAVING ALL THINGS COMMON<br />
AT THE TIME OF PENTECOST</h2>
<p>At the time of Pentecost the Jews were under the Romans. Since most of the saints were poor, there was the practice of having all things common (Acts 2:44; 4:32). If there were no poor saints, that is, if everyone was moderately well-off, there would have been no need to have all things common. The practice of having all things common proves that many of the saints were poor. On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were baptized and added to the church, and some among them were poor. Hence, the Holy Spirit moved and caused the rich to bring forth their possessions to distribute among the poor (2:45). This is entirely different from communism.</p>
<p>Peter and the apostles were not as capable as the Lord Jesus. The Lord knew how to prevent disorder, but the apostles did not. Hence, even though the believers had all things in common, complaints arose when the Jews who spoke Greek, the Hellenists, were neglected in the distribution of food (6:1). Only then did the apostles make arrangements. If the apostles had had the same view as the Lord Jesus, they would have made arrangements for the believers from the day of Pentecost, and there would have been no problem. The fact that the apostles did not do this shows that even though they were filled with the Holy Spirit, they did not have the foresight of the Lord, and they were unable to prevent these complaints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLES OF STEPHEN AND PHILIP</h2>
<p>After the complaints, the apostles chose seven men to serve tables, one of whom was Stephen. The book of Acts does not record how Stephen served tables, but it does record his disputing the truth with the Jews (v. 9). In those days there were many synagogues in Jerusalem, and one of them was called the synagogue of the Libertines. This was the gathering place of the Libertine Jews from Rome. Members of the synagogue of the Libertines and of other synagogues rose up to dispute with Stephen, because they were zealous for the Jewish religion and for the God of their Jewish fathers. Stephen did not merely serve tables; he had a gift to speak for the Lord (7:2-53). The message that he spoke in Acts 7 began with the calling of Abraham and developed in a very logical manner. Stephen was truly bold and courageous when he said, &ldquo;You always oppose the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 51).</p>
<p>Philip was another one of the seven serving ones. This was not the Philip who was among the twelve apostles. In Acts 8:5 Philip left Jerusalem and went down to Samaria to preach the gospel, and in 21:8 he is called Philip the evangelist. He was one of the four gifts mentioned in Ephesians 4:11. Some Bible expositors have said that in the choosing of seven to serve, Philip, who was an evangelist, should not have been chosen to serve tables. Whether or not he was an evangelist, Philip was a person full of the Spirit and of wisdom. If the apostles had allowed others to do this service instead of arranging for ones full of the Spirit and wisdom to serve tables, there would have been more complaints. It was not wrong to choose one who was an evangelist, because he was full of the Spirit and of wisdom. Foolish believers would be unable to carry out such a service. Both Philip and Stephen needed wisdom in order to preach the gospel and teach the word, and this wisdom was a help in serving tables, in managing the distribution of food. This required making some arrangements.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
