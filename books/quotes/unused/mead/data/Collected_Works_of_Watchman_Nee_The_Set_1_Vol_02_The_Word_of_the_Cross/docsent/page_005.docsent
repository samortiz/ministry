   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How do we "reckon"?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To reckon yourself dead to sin is to reckon yourself already crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is to reckon that your old man has already been crucified and that the cross of the Lord Jesus was also the cross for your old man; it is to reckon that the death of the Lord Jesus is the death of your old man and to reckon that the time the Lord Jesus died nineteen hundred years ago is the time your old man died.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The old man has already been crucified on the cross with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a fact, an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the eyes of God, the old man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we reckon that our old man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we reckon in our heart the things we believe in, God will accomplish the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, we should exercise our will to reckon ourselves dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do this, we will no longer be a slave to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To reckon is an act as well as an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An act is a one time matter, while an attitude is something one maintains all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>An act is a one time action toward a certain matter, while an attitude is a lasting evaluation toward something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should reckon ourselves dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that we should take a definite step to reckon ourselves dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After this, we should continually maintain an attitude of being dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The act is the beginning, and the attitude is the continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should have at least one time before God where, in a definite way, from that very day and hour, we reckon ourselves as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After that specific reckoning, we should daily maintain this attitude of a definite reckoning, an attitude that declares ourselves dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The failure of many people is this: they have reckoned themselves dead to sin and have received the word of dying with the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, they think that this matter is once for all and that once they have made such a reckoning, they will have no problem from then on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They think that just as one is dead when his physical body dies, so it is with the death of one's old man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They do not realize that the same is not true in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to daily and hourly reckon ourselves dead with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever a believer stops reckoning, his old man, in experience, will not be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why many people find that their old man seems to have resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this is something that can be settled once for all, we do not need to be watchful anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we know that we need to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Watchfulness is something we need to exercise moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way, to reckon our old man dead is something that is continual and uninterrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God's children are more aware of this, they will avoid many failures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To take such an attitude is not a mental exercise of the mind, but a lasting evaluation of ourselves in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One should be able "to reckon oneself as dead" whether consciously or unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's children often find it difficult to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oftentimes, they think that they have "forgotten" to reckon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have used the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To reckon is an exercise of the will, not a grappling in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether or not you overcome depends on whether or not you have adopted the attitude of reckoning yourself dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It does not depend on whether or not you remember to reckon.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you exercise your will by the Holy Spirit to maintain this attitude of death, you will find that consciously or unconsciously this attitude will be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The attitude is always the same whether you remember it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Naturally, our mind has its place, but we should not let the mind influence the will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The will should control the mind and should cause it to assist the will in maintaining this attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, daily and hourly, consciously or unconsciously, no matter what we do, we should always stand on the foundation of the cross and should reckon our old man as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here is the secret to overcoming sin and the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sin and the devil are related to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If sin cannot be our king, spontaneously the devil will not have any ground in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the believers realize and receive the truth of the cross, there will not be so many backsliding and failing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Long-lasting victory can never be separated from a long- lasting stand on the foundation of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, this is not to say that, after we have "reckoned" the old man dead in conduct and in attitude, the sin within us will be eliminated and nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as we are still in the body, sin will still be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To say that sin can be nullified in this life is not the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can put our old man to death through trusting in the cross of the Lord on Golgotha, and we can cause the body of sin to be powerless, to wither, and to be paralyzed as dead; but we can never cause sin to be nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we are careless, unwatchful, and not standing on the death ground of Golgotha, our old man will be activated and will exercise its authority and power again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Satan is seeking an opportunity all day long to activate him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wherever there is an opening, Satan will try to restore our old man to his original position.</S>
