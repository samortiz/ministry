   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the past we may have thought that we need to shepherd people's spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We stress the spirit of man, and we tell people to reject the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we need to realize that the saints' problems are with their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may feel that if their spirit is strong, there will be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But how could their spirit be strong when they have a lot of problems in their soul?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we have to learn how to shepherd their souls, how to touch their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today on this earth, there is not one person who does not have any problem in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why I encourage you all to open up yourself to your fellow brothers so that the Lord can have a way to shepherd your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need this kind of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's recovery in the United States has come to a point where we cannot go on further without the shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are hot for the Lord to the extent that we are burning, we will pick up the burden to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though we may not know how to contact others, we will learn by doing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I can never forget a story about D. L. Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He once made a vow to preach the gospel to at least one person each day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Late one night, close to midnight, he was about to go to bed when he remembered that he had not preached the gospel to anyone that day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He went out into the street to find someone to whom he could speak before the day was over.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He found a policeman and exhorted him to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The policeman rebuked him angrily, and Moody hurried home, but within a few days this policeman was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because D. L. Moody had made such a vow, he built up a habit of contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these days the Lord needs flocks of shepherds to shepherd His flocks.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all have to be the shepherds who are burdened to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's people everywhere have been scattered because there is no shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must realize that our shepherding should not be initiated by our care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 21 reveals that our shepherding should be initiated from our love to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We desire to contact people because we love the Lord, knowing that He loves people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nothing can please the Lord as much as our going out to shepherd His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I assure you that if you contact people regularly, this will make you happy because the Lord is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Shepherding should not be initiated from our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It should be initiated from our loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord asked Peter if he loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Peter said, "Yes, Lord, You know," the Lord told him to feed His lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He again asked Peter if he loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since Peter said, "Yes, Lord, You know," He told Peter to shepherd His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord asked Peter a third time if he loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Peter said again, "Lord, You know," the Lord told him to feed His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter failed the Lord three times, and the Lord asked him if he loved Him three times.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His speaking to Peter indicated to him that he should forget about his failure and take care of the Lord's lambs and sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today what is needed in the recovery is for us to rise up to shepherd others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to contact people of our own age group.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I tried to contact the teenagers, they might run away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if our young people go to contact other young people, no one will run from them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we sent older ones to the campuses, it would be difficult for them to contact the young students.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am sharing this to encourage the young people among us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not say that you are too young.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is wonderful to be young, because this gives you a way to contact other young people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today the church's need is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My burden is to stir you up that you may realize that today the Lord's recovery needs you to rise up to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have to build up a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do not contact people, you cannot be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should even become addicted to the Lord's love to take care of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I want to remind you to make a list of all your acquaintances.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may think that you do not know that many people, but when you make a list, you may find out that you have over a hundred people whom you know.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You should pray over these names, seeking the Lord's leading as to whom you should contact.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes when you contact someone, you may feel that he is the wrong person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But according to my experience, no contacts are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not say that you caught a fish which is the wrong fish.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No fish is wrong, as long as it was hooked by you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The only thing that is wrong is for you not to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may feel that a certain man is the wrong person because he is too proud.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But you have to check with yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Are you not proud?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On this earth, who is not proud?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even the little children know how to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we are waiting to contact the best people, the perfect people, we will have no one to contact.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No contacts are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even the policeman which D. L. Moody contacted close to midnight was the right person.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can also see from George M ller's autobiography that no person would not believe in the Lord Jesus if you keep contacting him continuously for your whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>George M ller prayed for many gospel candidates.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When he went to the Lord, all of them except one was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eventually, even that one was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is why I say you need the patience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You should always try to have four or five people under your care.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You may be led to contact someone who has no feeling to pursue the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Still you should keep contacting him in a regular way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After five years the "tide" to be interested in the Lord Jesus will come to this man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You may contact someone in the spring, and he may not have any heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But after half a year, the tide will come for him to desire the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I was saved in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although I was raised in Christianity, I did not believe in the Lord Jesus until I was nineteen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>My sister loved the Lord and prayed for me.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>She recommended me to a Chinese pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This pastor came to see me once a week for a number of months.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He would simply say, "Come to our church on Sunday."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I nodded my head, but I would not go.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Eventually, on the second day of the Chinese New Year, I suddenly decided to go to the Chinese Independent Church, the church of the pastor who came to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It was through this that I heard the proper preaching of the gospel and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is no wonder that the apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:58 that our labor for Christ will never be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Bible also tells us that we may sow and others may harvest; also, others may sow and we may harvest John 4:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Only the Lord knows to whom the credit should be given.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, we must have a burden and build up a habit to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Every day we should contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I told you already not to expect quick fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Any fruit produced quickly is artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Artificial flowers can be produced overnight, but real flowers take a number of months to grow and blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>According to the New Testament teaching, the first burden, the first responsibility, of the believers is to get people.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>John is a book on life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In chapter fifteen the Lord, who is life, tells us that we are His branches v. 5 . The job, the profession, and the responsibility of a branch is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we abide in Him, we bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>To abide in Him means to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we do not bear fruit, the Father, who is the Cultivator, will take us away v. 2 . Then we will lose the position to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Very few Christians are abiding in Christ, because they do not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>To recover your enjoyment of Christ is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If you have not been revived, go to contact people for one or two weeks, and you can be revived.</S>
