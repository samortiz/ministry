[2]  This book is a translation of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the Chinese-speaking meetings in Anaheim, California on the Lord's Days between February and April of 1983.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Col 2:2; 3:4; Phil 1:19-21 THE MYSTERY OF GOD CHRIST
[4]  In Colossians 2 Paul told the Colossians that he wanted them to know how great a struggle he had for them and for those who had not seen his face, that their hearts might be comforted and that they might be knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ vv.
[5]  Here, the mystery of God, Christ literally means that God is difficult to understand and comprehend and therefore is a mystery, but Christ is the explanation, expression, and manifestation of the mysterious God.
[6]  The most important ones are Christ being the allotted portion of the saints v. 12 , Christ being the image of the invisible God v. 15a , Christ being the Firstborn of all creation v. 15b , and Christ being the first One in resurrection and in the new creation v. 18 . After speaking about who Christ is in chapter one, Paul goes on in chapter two to give Christ an aggregate title by saying that Christ is the mystery of God.
[7]  THE MANIFESTATION OF THE DIVINE CHARACTERISTICS THROUGH ALL THE CREATED THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE
[8]  Romans 1:20 says, "For the invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world."
[9]  When you see that the universe is full of light, you know that God is light; the universe is beautiful, so God is a God of beauty; the universe is full of vitality, so God is brimming with life; the universe is orderly with the heavenly bodies revolving in their proper orbits, so God is orderly and without confusion.
[10]  In Greek, the expression the Spirit of Jesus Christ means that the Spirit is Jesus Christ; hence, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ.
[11]  Philippians 1:19 says, "For me this will turn out to salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
[12]  Regardless of our circumstances, the life-giving Spirit becomes our salvation through His bountiful supply.
[13]  Paul was a good pattern of one who lived according to the spirit, one who lived Christ.
[14]  He always allowed Christ to be magnified in his body under any circumstances, whether smooth or rough, good or bad, whether through life or through death Phil 1:20b .
[15]  CHAPTER TWO THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Col 2:2, 9; 3:4; Phil 1:19-21a
[16]  You are our God and our Lord, and yet You became the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us as our life and everything.
[17]  The Bible tells us that man is composed of three parts.
[18]  The need within the spirit of man cannot be satisfied by wealth and fame, nor by entertainment and amusement, nor by the religions invented by men.
[19]  The Bible explicitly says that the Lord Jesus, the God-man, has become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b to dwell in our spirit.
[20]  Because the Lord Jesus is God, the Spirit has the element of God, and because He is also a man, the Spirit also has the element of man.
[21]  CHAPTER THREE THE INDWELLING CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 14:16-20, 23; 15:4a; Rom 8:9-11; Eph 3:16-17
[22]  Prayer: O Lord, we worship You because You are our God, our Creator, and our Redeemer.
[23]  May You anoint us richly with Your Spirit and move within each one to shine forth the light of Your word, so that while we are reading, we may see the light and revelation and receive the supply of the Holy Spirit.
[24]  Lord, we thank and praise You from deep within, because You died and resurrected for us and have become the life-giving Spirit, who not only is in heaven but also dwells in our spirit.
[25]  THE LORD JESUS AS THE COMFORTER INSIDE HIS DISCIPLES AFTER HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION
[26]  While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was with His disciples in an outward way for three and a half years; He was a tender, caring Comforter.
[27]  However, after three and a half years, suddenly one day He told His disciples that He was going away from them and was going to Him who sent Him John 16:5 .
[28]  John 14:16-17a says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality."
[29]  Verse 17b goes on to say that "the world cannot receive" the Spirit of reality, "because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you."
[30]  Chapter fourteen says, "You in Me, and I in you" v. 20 ; it also says, "If anyone loves Me, We My Father and I will come to him and make an abode with him" v. 23 . Then chapter fifteen says, "Abide in Me and I in you" v. 4a . Not only so, Romans 8:9 goes further to say that "the Spirit of God dwells in you." The Spirit of God here is the Spirit of Christ, even Christ Himself.
[31]  THE LORD JESUS BECOMING OUR SALVATION THROUGH TEN GREAT STEPS
[32]  From the Bible we can see that the Lord Jesus became the salvation of those who believe in Him through ten great steps.
[33]  In the preceding chapter we saw the indwelling Christ Christ as the indwelling One who lives in us.
[34]  Some Christians know that Christ's indwelling is a mystery, but they do not truly understand it.
[35]  Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit," and Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God."
[36]  CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL
[37]  Christ has entered into us and is dwelling in us, but now He still wants to make His home in our hearts.
[38]  In order to understand this matter, I spent much time studying the New Testament, hoping to find out from the Bible what it means for Christ to make His home in our hearts and how He does it.
[39]  It has been thirty-three years since 1950, when I began to speak about the mingling of God with man and the indwelling of Christ.
[40]  We have covered the indwelling Christ and Christ's indwelling in the previous chapters.
[41]  The entire Bible tells us a wonderful and mysterious thing, that is, that the Triune God desires to work Himself into His believers.
[42]  However, after man fell, the evil element entered into man causing man to have the evil nature.
[43]  Moreover, in Philippians 1:21 Paul said that to him, to live was Christ.
[44]  If a person is confused in his mind, muddled in his emotions, and indecisive in his will, he does not have the expression of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and neither can he live Christ.
[45]  Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."
[46]  CHAPTER SIX LIVING OUT CHRIST IN HUMAN VIRTUES 1 Scripture Reading: Phil 1:8, 19, 21; 2:1-3; 3:6b-10; 4:8-9 LONGING AFTER THE SAINTS IN THE BOWELS OF CHRIST JESUS
[47]  Philippians 1:8 says, "I in the inward parts of Christ Jesus."
[48]  In the Chinese Union Version this verse is translated as: "I understand the bowels of Christ Jesus."
[49]  This rendering seems to be saying that the bowels of Christ Jesus are His alone and that I just sympathize with and understand His bowels.
[50]  Philippians 2:1 says, "If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions."
[51]  Philippians 1 shows us that Paul was one with Christ.
[52]  Man was created in God's image, possessing the image of God's virtues.
[53]  Christ is the embodiment of God, the reality of God's virtues.
[54]  When you receive Christ into you, your love becomes one of His "rooms," your righteousness becomes another "room," and your holiness becomes still another "room."
[55]  But if because of our faith in Christ we reject ourselves and allow Christ to live out from us, then what we express is not our own righteousness by our own keeping of the law but the righteousness which is out of God through faith in Him.
[56]  CHAPTER SEVEN LIVING OUT CHRIST IN HUMAN VIRTUES 2 Scripture Reading: Phil 1:8, 19-21; 2:1-5, 3:6b-10; 4:8-9, 13 TWO ASPECTS IN THE BOOK OF PHILIPPIANS
[57]  I believe that after reading the above verses from the book of Philippians, we can sense that the words are so sweet and precious.
[58]  We constantly preach concerning the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the power of the resurrection of Christ, Christ as the One who empowers us, and the enjoyment of the God of peace.
[59]  We Christians are precious in that we have God in us, we have the Spirit of Jesus Christ as our bountiful supply, we have the resurrection power of Christ operating in us, and we have Christ empowering us.
[60]  We who have the life of Christ in us are reprints of Christ.
[61]  But what things were gains to me including the righteousness of the law , these I have counted as loss on account of Christ on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord."
[62]  In the previous chapters we saw how to experience Christ as our life and how to live out Christ in our human virtues.
[63]  Rather, we are speaking about Christ as our life being lived out of us, that is, Christ being lived out in our human virtues and becoming the expression of our perfect living.
[64]  Genesis 1:26 clearly tells us that God created man in His image.
[65]  That God created man in His image means that He created man according to what He is.
[66]  THE VIRTUES IN THE BOOK OF PHILIPPIANS BEING LOVE, LIGHT, HOLINESS, AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
[67]  Philippians 4:8-9 mentions a total of eight virtues.
[68]  The first six items include the things that are true, the things that are dignified, the things that are righteous, the things that are pure, the things that are lovely, and the things that are well spoken of.
[69]  Living out Christ in our daily life means that God in Christ enters into us to be our life and reality and that He is expressed through our humanity in our human love, light, holiness, and righteousness.
[70]  EXPERIENCING THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST
[71]  Philippians 1:19 refers to "the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
[72]  The phrase the Spirit of Jesus Christ shows us that Jesus Christ is the Spirit and that the Spirit is Jesus Christ Himself.
[73]  When we experience Christ, we experience Him as the Spirit, because Christ can be in us only by being the Spirit.
[74]  He is God who became a man, Christ who became Jesus, the One in whom God and man were united and mingled.
[75]  CHAPTER NINE HOW TO ENJOY THE SUBJECTIVE SALVATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-20; 3:10; 4:13; 2:12-13; 4:6, 9
[76]  GOD CREATING MAN WITH A SPIRIT THAT MAN MAY CONTACT AND RECEIVE HIM
[77]  The Bible tells us that in the universe there is only one sovereign Lord.
[78]  You may call Him Jehovah; you may call Him Jesus; you may call Him the Triune God; you may also call Him the Lord of heaven and earth, the God of all things.
[79]  THE TRIUNE GOD NOT FOR OUR DOCTRINAL UNDERSTANDING BUT FOR OUR ENJOYMENT
[80]  The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is a mystery.
[81]  According to the context, we see that the Spirit of Jesus Christ is Christ Himself because the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ enables us to magnify Christ.
[82]  The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is for Christ to be magnified; therefore, the magnified Christ is the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[83]  Philippians 3:10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection."
[84]  The power of resurrection is the content of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
