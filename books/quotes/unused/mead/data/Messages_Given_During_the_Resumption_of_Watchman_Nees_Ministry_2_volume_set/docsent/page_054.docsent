   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERYTHING NOT OF GOD'S LIFE BEING BURNED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 2 is a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There we see the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter three we see the river of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The flame signifies God's holiness, and the sword signifies God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As far as God's holiness and righteousness are concerned, we should die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All those who will not allow the river of life to flow through them will have the river of fire flowing through them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything that will not give way to the flow of the river of life will eventually pass through the burning of the river of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Christian's life, work, family, and business must all be put under the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible, many places mention fire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people have told us that when the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, Japan, even the iron and steel were melted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today, God's river of fire of judgment will melt away anything that is not of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only by allowing the river of life to flow through us will there be the gold, the pearl, and the precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, everything else is wood, grass, stubble, and dung.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only will our work pass away; even God's own heaven and earth will be burned one day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, our own work, those things that do not belong to God, will be burned away also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only God's life will remain forever.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything that is not of life will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although these things may be created by God, they do not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As such, they will be burned away also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A carpenter takes a piece of wood and makes a beautiful table out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The table is placed in the sitting room, and the remaining chaff and odd pieces are taken to the stove in the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The stove represents the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the end of Revelation, on the one hand, there is the city of water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, there is the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The city of water signifies God's life and His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The lake of fire signifies God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's glory speaks of God Himself, whereas God's holiness tells us that everything not of God and not according to His nature will be thrown into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is our basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may do the right things and may manage the church well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But these things are not the gold, the pearl, and the precious stones, because God's life has not passed through these things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fire does not remove defilements; it only removes that which is not holy, and that which does not belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's fire not only burns away everything bad; it also burns away everything that is not according to God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In man's mind, there is only good and bad.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a house is burned, no matter how beautiful the wood outside looks, it will all be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only thing that will be left will be the steel and the concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fire separates and tests things out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything that is not of God, no matter how good it is, will be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wood is very good, but it will be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not know if you can take my words.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you can take them, your whole being will be turned, and you will not dare to walk according to your own will any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose I am about to visit a person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I should not ask if this is God's will and if I should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, I should ask if God is going with me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we are afraid of is not doing the wrong thing, but doing things apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have God with us, not only will we do the right thing, but God will pass through us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Formerly, our only fear was that we would do the wrong thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today, our fear is that we would do things by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if what we do is right outwardly, as long as there is the self-element, we will not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The real work is one in which God works alongside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything that comes out of the mind and the will are rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God only wants something that comes out of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today, between the river of water and the river of fire, there is still a river of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What should have been consumed by the river of fire is merged into the river of water by passing through the river of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have the river of blood to take care of everything that is of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, we need to examine ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the other hand, after we have examined ourselves, we need to trust in the blood of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way, we will be saved from the river of fire into the river of water.</S>
