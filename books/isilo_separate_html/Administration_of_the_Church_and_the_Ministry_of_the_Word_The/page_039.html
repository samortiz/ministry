NATIONAL SUPERIORITY AND WORLDLY CUSTOMS</h2>
<p>The building up of the church does not depend on our acknowledgment of Western things as good. Even if eighty percent of the things from the West are good, at least twenty percent of the things in the East are also good. We should not think that people from the West are one hundred percent correct. Otherwise, the churches in the East and in the West will not be built up together.</p>
<p>Two days ago a Western brother said that several serving ones from the workers&rsquo; house were at a birthday party with his family. He invited the serving ones from the workers&rsquo; house to rejoice with them on his child&rsquo;s birthday. We should not bring worldly customs into our midst. In taking the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have not celebrated birthdays for the past thirty years. We are not without fault, but some Western missionaries should be criticized. They have come to the East to do the Lord&rsquo;s work, but they are also damaging the Lord&rsquo;s work. To celebrate their children&rsquo;s birthday and even invite serving ones to participate is a fleshly act that will damage the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>This may encourage those who live in the workers&rsquo; house to celebrate their children&rsquo;s birthdays. This is intolerable. We have allowed the brothers from the West to influence us instead of our influencing them. Those who labor for the Lord must be very careful. Whenever we receive an invitation, we must know who is involved and the purpose of the gathering. We preach the truth concerning not loving the world, and we desire that others would not love the world. For the past thirty years the co-workers have not celebrated birthdays for our children or even our parents. We must learn this lesson to build up the church. Otherwise, our labor will be according to a Chinese proverb which says that we are grinding soybeans without producing any tofu. Our labor will be in vain. For this reason, we must not be proud or overly humble in knowing the source of a matter.</p>
<p>Before inviting a Western brother to speak, we considered the fact that he had publicly thanked those who sent him Christmas cards. Although I received spiritual help from this brother, in this matter he needed to be helped. If Christmas is condemned by God, then even if people send us cards, we should not thank them. This example shows that not all things from the West are right. They need our help in many matters. Although they have no light concerning the church ground, they refuse to be helped in this matter. They even debate and argue repeatedly concerning the church ground. This displays a sense of national superiority. In order for the churches in the East and the West to be built up, the brothers from the West must be open to the church ground. We have not been playing games for the past thirty years. We have given our lives to take this way. We should not lightly consider any matter in the church. We should be desperate in some matters and let other matters go. We respect the spiritual ministries from the West, but we do not agree that everything from the West is correct.</p>
<p>The churches are before us. We accept the Western brothers who are with us, and we must allow them to serve the Lord. However, we must learn to know people and to discern matters. We must also know what we can and cannot accept. We even need to discern matters concerning a young brother or a young sister. We should encourage what is proper and restrict what is not proper. Merely preaching the gospel to save sinners and edifying the believers cannot build up the genuine church of the Lord. We must draw others to Christ and help them to be established and built up in the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
