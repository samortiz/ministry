Most of the students and even the teachers of the Bible have not entered into the intrinsic significance of this portion of the holy Word
The way to study, to understand, and to interpret the holy Word is exemplified by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 22:23-33
In the Lords answer He told the Sadducees that although they had the Pentateuch the Scriptures in their hands they did not understand it
The Lord quoted Moses' writing in Exodus 3:6: 'I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'
Next, the Lord interpreted His quotation of the holy Word, telling the Sadducees that God is not the God of the dead but of the living
The first crucial and striking point concerning God's creation of man is that God created man in His image and according to His likeness
God is love ; God is light ; God is holy and is even holiness ; and God is righteous and is even righteousness
He was God, lofty in the universe; but the great, unlimited God came down to the lowest part of the universe to be a small, limited man
By this He indicated that while He lived here on earth as a man He the eternal infinite unlimited God was limited even in the matter of time
A man and woman may love each other during their courtship, but immediately after their wedding they may argue with each other
In God's creation we are all made God in the sense that we were created in God's image and according to God's likeness
We look like God, just as a photograph of a person looks like the person, because we were made in God's image and according to His likeness
In Genesis 1 we are told that in God's creation, God made the plants and the animals after their own kind, respectively
Toy makers make toys in human form, but in that form there is no reality, because there is no life within the toys
God's intention in creating man was that God and man, man and God, could be joined in a union that is altogether organic, in life
God not only formed a body to be the frame of man, but He also produced a spirit to be the very inner organ within man
If we stay away from our spirit and remain in our mind, the more we think, the more we consider, the more we will feel that there is no God
According to these verses we all should walk by and according to the Spirit to the extent that we do everything according to the Spirit
In doing their shopping the sisters may shop mainly according to the sales advertised in the newspapers, not according to the Spirit
After they buy certain items, they may turn from their mind to their spirit and regret and even repent for what they have done
When a wife says something to her husband, the husband should not answer quickly but should answer according to his spirit
When parents are going to rebuke their children, they should prepare themselves to do it according to the Spirit
The unique way for the parents to do this without provoking their children is to do it according to the Spirit
If we are going on to live as a child of God and a member of Christ, we must live Christ , making Christ also our subjective righteousness
According to Genesis 2:7, the issue of God's breathing the breath of life into man's body of dust was that man became a living soul
We should not live a Chinese, an American, a German, or a Frenchman; we should live Christ by doing everything according to our spirit
In this one thing we have all offended the Lord in our not living Him by doing everything according to the Spirit
We may do things according to right and wrong, by avoiding what is wrong and doing our best to do what is right
The third striking point in God's creation of man is that after God created man, He put man before the tree of life
In the Bible the tree of life is mentioned first in Genesis 2, and it proceeds through the Bible to the end, to Revelation 22
Between the two ends of the Bible, in Revelation 2:7 the Lord promised the overcomers that He will give them to eat of the tree of life
A vine tree is not for producing material for the construction of a building; a vine tree is good only for producing fruit
Christ today is just such a vine, bearing fruit for His propagation and multiplication and for our nourishment
In brief, the tree of life in the Bible is a figure of the Triune God embodied in Christ to be the very substance of the divine life
God created man in a living way, because His image and likeness are not lifeless, outward forms but are organic and full of life
To make man in God's image and likeness did not require any material, but to make a body, a frame, for man required some material
In our body we have many organs, including two ears for hearing, two eyes for seeing, a nose for smelling, and a tongue for tasting
If we would turn from our thinking mind to our innermost part, our spirit, spontaneously we would say, 'O God'!
Because of this, in John 4:24 the Lord Jesus told us, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit '
God created man not according to a monkey's kind or a dog's kind, but according to His kind, in His image and according to His likeness
Because we are children of God, we are God in nature and in life, but not in the Godhead, that is, not in God's position or rank
Although the man created by God was complete, having God's image and likeness and God's breath of life, man was still short of God Himself
Apparently, the created man was perfect; actually, he was not perfect because, although he was like God, he did not have God Himself
He simply brought man into a garden and put him in front of a strange, peculiar, and particular tree called the tree of life
Since the tree of knowledge of good and evil was next to the tree of life, God warned man not to eat of it, lest he die
The Bible begins with God, man, and the tree of life in Genesis 1 and 2, and it ends with God, man, and the tree of life in Revelation 22
In His wisdom He presented us a figure of Himself a tree that grows, spreads, and produces fruit good for food
Through a council held among the three of the Trinity , God made a counsel to create man and even to become a man
The first promise that He would come was given to Adam , and the second promise, two thousand years later, was given to Abraham
He then made a further promise to Abraham, saying, 'And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed'
The life of God is in the incarnated Word , and this incarnated Word came to bring God's life to man abundantly
Eventually, He died as a grain of wheat to release the divine life , and He became the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection
Afterward, He was resurrected, and in resurrection He as a God-man and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
In resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God , and we were born with Him to be the many sons of God
From the heavens He poured Himself out as the consummated, compounded, all-inclusive Spirit upon His disciples
After entering into His believing people, God becomes one spirit with them in the organic union of the divine life
In the organic union the vine and the branches coinhere; the vine abides in the branches and the branches abide in the vine
The incarnation of God for Him to enter into man has been going on for two thousand years, from the first century to the twentieth century
God's incarnation is just to carry out God's desire with His good pleasure to be one with man in the organic union
He created us six thousand years ago, He became us two thousand years ago, and He entered into us to be us today
As Christians, we should live God, express God, and manifest God by walking and doing everything in the Spirit and according to the Spirit
God's good pleasure forms the will of God, and for this will God held a council in His Divine Trinity to make a counsel
For the almighty, unlimited, infinite God to work Himself into the small, limited, finite man to be one with this man is a great thing
In Genesis 2 God brought the completed man as the high life on this earth to a tree not an apple tree but a tree of life, a life tree
The life embodied in the tree of life is not the vegetable life nor the animal life nor the human life, but the divine life
That word was God's first promise to man, indicating that the very God who created man would one day come to be a man
After giving His word of promise to Adam, God was patient and waited for two thousand years, apparently doing nothing to fulfill His word
God came in to make another promise, this time to Abraham: 'And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed'
John 7:39 says that 'the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified'; that is, Jesus had not yet entered into resurrection
In eternity He was the only begotten Son of God , but in resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God
Within us He is the life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ , who is the embodiment of the Triune God
God is Christ, and Christ now is the Lord of all, the Christ of God, the Leader of all the rulers on this earth, and the Savior
In studying the Bible, we need to cut a hole in the ice and dive to the bottom of the ocean to see what is there
Immediately He, as the all-inclusive, compound Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God, entered into everyone who received Him
Christ's death on the cross did a wonderful job of terminating our sinful constitution and taking away all our sinfulness
Now there is no contradiction between us and God; the situation between us and God has been altogether appeased
Now we can thank Him for His all-inclusive death that has terminated our sinful constitution and has redeemed us from our sinfulness
Through such a redemption we have been forgiven, and God has justified us and even reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself
Now He remains in us, abides in us , lives in us , is being formed in us , and is making His home in our hearts
We are in the pneumatic Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God and the consummation of the Triune God
We have been justified by God and reconciled to God, and we are in an absolutely peaceful condition and situation with God
God's salvation is nothing but God Himself making Himself our contents and making us a part of Him in the divine organic union
He prepared a spirit within man that man might contact Him, receive Him, and contain Him by the way of taking God as his life
In His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit that He might enter into our spirit to be one with us in this spirit
Now He is within us so that day by day we may live Him, express Him, and magnify Him by walking and doing everything according to the Spirit
Our growth is based on the fact that we have been regenerated by the Spirit with the life of God as the seed contained in God's word
According to God's economy, every person should have another birth, a second birth; that is, every person should be regenerated
Because we were sinners and even were the totality of sin with a sinful constitution, we needed God's forgiveness
Even though we may be thoroughly cleansed and purified, there still has been no change in our nature, substance, element, and essence
As long as they have been forgiven, have peace, and eventually will go to heaven, many Christians are satisfied
From that time we began to have two lives our natural life from our parents, and our divine life, which is from God and is God
From the day that the Lord sowed Himself into us, we have been growing not only physically but also divinely and spiritually
Much of the teaching in today's Christianity focuses on matters such as how to have a good married life and family life
According to the Old Testament typology, the firstfruits were to be presented to God in His sanctuary for God's enjoyment
In Revelation 14 the firstfruits are mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, and the harvest follows near the end of the chapter
In the growth of a seed two elements, the seed and the earth, meet together, mingle together, and grow together
Every day He is growing, first to grow in us to make us the firstfruits, the overcomers, who are signified by Zion in the Old Testament
If all the believers are common and general, the church will be merely Jerusalem without a high peak, without Zion
The Bible tells us that God has sown Himself into our spirit as the life seed to grow a tree, a miniature of the tree of life
The tree of life was unique in Genesis 2:9, but today the tree of life grows in all of us, causing each of us to be a small tree of life
Sometimes they will be blessed to receive Christ not only as a small seed, but as a large plant planted into their being
They will be happy and will tell others that they are no longer empty, but they now have something within them, that is, Christ
Peter 2:2 says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation'
America needs Christ to grow in the neighborhoods, in the schools, in the offices, and among the families and the in-laws
We should not merely attend the church meetings; we need to grow that we may be a tree of life to nourish today's communities in America
Needless to say with the unbelievers, even with the believers there is the shortage of Christ, the lacking of the growth of Christ
We still need to be saved every day, even every minute, from our temper, from our sorrows, and from our anxiety
Drinking the milk of the word causes us to grow unto salvation from our anger our temper our anxiety our worry our fear and our trembling
We need to grow unto maturity to know God to know the Bible to know the church and to know todays situation and condition in a mature way
We need spiritual teeth that can eat such solid food, and we also need a spiritual stomach to digest such words
In Ephesians 4:15 Paul said, 'But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ'
Even in small matters such as getting our hair cut, combing our hair, and choosing a necktie, we need to do them in Christ
Today it is difficult to realize the building up of the church, because most Christians have not grown but have remained infants
From the time of their birth they lived in a situation and environment which fit in with their growth in every aspect
God is in us, but He is short of His increase in us because we do not provide adequate room, adequate space, for Him to grow
Our growing is for the unique purpose of God, that is, the building up of the Body of Christ through transformation
When an infant is built up to be a young boy of thirteen years of age, he is built up not by having things added to him
Ephesians 4:15 says, 'But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ'
In the recent rebellion in the Lord's recovery a teaching was promoted which said that all the local churches are autonomous
As an organism every man was conceived as a child in his mothers womb and remained there for nine months before being born out of that womb
The various parts of a childs body are not added to him along the way they are already present and develop by the organic growth of his body
The growth of the Body of Christ is through the members growing into the Head, Christ, in all things by holding to truth in love
Our appetite may not be for shepherding or taking care of the saints; rather, our taste may be to talk about others
If we add together all the time spent on the telephone in one week, we may discover that we have spent more than two hours on the telephone
According to Ephesians 4:15, the members of the Body grow up into Christ in all things by holding to truth in love
Dear saints, if this word impresses you and you take it, practice it, and live it, you will receive much blessing
Of speaking vainly about others, it is better for you to shut your eyes and sit down to rest awhile in the Lord
When we speak something to others in vanity, this indicates that we do not love the Lord and we do not love the one of whom we are speaking
If everyone in a church refrains from exposing others and is full of prayers, singing, and praises to the Lord, that church is beautiful
When we come to the meeting, the meeting will be uplifted, high, full of the Spirit, full of singing, and full of Amens
Because all the attendants in the meeting are deadened, sometimes it is difficult for the speakers to begin the meeting
When each member is perfected to do the work of the New Testament ministry, all the members will know how to build up the Body
During every meal as we take food into our stomach, digestion, a metabolic process, immediately begins to take place
The first kind of joining the joining through the joints of the rich supply is like putting pieces together to form the frame of a building
The parts of the Body that are knit, or interwoven, together are not the gifted persons but the common members of the Body
Some gifted persons will be joined together to form the frame, and the rest will do their part by functioning in their measure
Regardless of how weak certain members may be, or even how evil they may be, we love them because they are members
In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church'
In Ephesians 1:10 Paul said that the church carries out the economy of God that all things can be headed up in Christ
Since the church will be headed up in Christ, the church will be used by Christ to head up all things in the universe in Christ
By the carrying out of the New Testament ministry, the building up of the church will be completed for the consummation of the New Jerusalem
We all have to realize that the church as the Body of Christ is an organism, an organic constitution constituted with divinity plus humanity
May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us the grace we need, so that such a wonderful building can be seen on the earth today
At the beginning of the Bible a very striking, particular, and peculiar tree, the tree of life, is standing there
Some maps of the world place the Mediterranean Sea with the small nation of Israel on its eastern shore at the center of the populated world
Genesis 2 tells us that where the tree of life was, there was a river with four heads, one of which was the Euphrates
The Euphrates is one of the four heads of the particular river that flowed out of Eden to water the garden where the tree of life was
We need to be bold to say that Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God is a tree a vine tree and this vine tree is the tree of life
Between Genesis and Revelation there is another chapter of the Bible concerning Christ John 15 in which He told us that He is the true vine
They might also advise us not to touch the entire book of Revelation in which the New Jerusalem is mentioned because Revelation is a mystery
On the other hand, some careless pastors might say that the New Jerusalem is a heavenly mansion that Christ is building for us in heaven
If we do believe in Christ, when we die, we will go there to enjoy the eternal life, which equals the eternal blessings
The three sections of the New Jerusalem are constructed with three kinds of materials, or three kinds of elements
Through His death we were redeemed, and His death also released His divine life , the life juice of the 'oyster'
Through Christ's resurrection we were regenerated , and regeneration is the very entrance into the kingdom of God
The twelve tribes represent the Old Testament saints, and the twelve apostles represent the New Testament saints
Without the Spirit it would be impossible for us as pieces of clay to become jasper, bearing the same appearance as God
The New Jerusalem is a city with three elements constituted into our being to make the Triune God mingled with us, His redeemed people
On the one hand we can say that the Triune God is our destination, and on the other hand we can say that the holy city is our destination
Revelation 21:3 tells us that such a New Jerusalem is first the tabernacle of our God, God's dwelling place for eternity
In the New Jerusalem there is the wonderful fact that God will abide in us and we will abide in Him, that is, that He and we will coinhere
In Revelation 22:1 and 3 the throne is called 'the throne of God and of the Lamb,' indicating that there are two sitting on the same throne
The water of life quenches our thirst, and the tree of life nourishes us, feeds us, and satisfies us organically
The water of life quenches our thirst from within, and the tree of life nourishes us also from within, by our drinking and by our eating
For eternity we will be organically united with God every day and every minute by our eating and drinking of Him
In that age God remade many people out of the old creation into the new creation, including Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
In the church meetings we are all 'butterflies,' but after going back home, we may all go back to our 'cocoon'
The fourth age is the age of the kingdom, the millennium, from Christ's second coming to the end of the old creation
Eventually, the New Jerusalem will come as the eternal consummation of the church to be God's ultimate organism
We should not take that way; we should take the way of the tree of life, the way of partaking of God as our life
Even if we try to lose our temper, we will have no temper to lose, because all our temper will be swallowed up by the addition of God
Our goal should not be to live a life without losing our temper; our goal should be to live a life that expresses God
We need to give people the impression that we are a God-man, even that we are genuinely God in His nature and in His life
The way to be in God is to turn to our spirit, and the way to make this turn is to say, 'O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah'
If we all live a life that lives God, expresses God, and manifests God, what a benefit the entire human society will receive through us!
He has redeemed us, and now He is living in us and with us to cause us to live with Him in order that we may express Him
