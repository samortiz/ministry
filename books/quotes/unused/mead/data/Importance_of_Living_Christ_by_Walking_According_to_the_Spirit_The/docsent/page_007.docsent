   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM 2 Scripture Reading: John 15:4; Gal 2:20; Rom 8:4</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prayer: Lord, shame Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We trust in Your blood to cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Under the covering of Your blood we stand against the enemy and enjoy You.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, anoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to see more of You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Show us Your way the way in life and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, show us that You are living in us, and show us how to live You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By Your mercy and grace, cause us to see the things concerning Your economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this chapter we will continue to consider the focus of the Bible, which can be found in John 15:4 and Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 15:4 the Lord Jesus said, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may be familiar with these simple words, yet we need to realize that they convey a profound revelation that has been greatly neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE BELIEVERS BEING BRANCHES</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF CHRIST, WHO IS THE EMBODIMENT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus was with His disciples for three and a half years and gave them many messages, including His word in Matthew 5 7.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The last message that the Lord gave to His disciples before His crucifixion is recorded in John 14 16, and the focus of this last message is in chapter 15, which uses the illustration of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 5 the Lord said, I am the vine; you are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These words are simple, but their significance is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No other portion in the Bible defines and describes the Trinity in as much detail as John 14 16 does.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 14:7-11 reveals that the Father is one with the Son, for the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, the Son is the Father s embodiment and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verses 16 through 20 tell us that the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then in chapter 15 we see that the Son is the vine, and the Father is the husbandman v. 1 . Verse 26 mentions the Spirit of reality again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Chapter 16 continues to reveal the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Son has been given all that the Father has, and the Spirit reveals and conveys to us all that the Son is vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the Spirit conveys to us the entire Triune God the Spirit comes with the Son and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The vine is Christ the Son, who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As branches in the vine, the believers are members of Christ Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12, 27; Eph 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The vine in John 15 is the universal new man, of which Christ is the Head and all the believers are the members Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the believers are branches of Christ, who embodies the Triune God, we may also say that the believers are the branches of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We branch out the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To teach that we branch out the Triune God according to John 15 is not to teach that we are God as an object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we were born of Adam, we are the branches of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we have children, we continue to branch out Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We began as branches of Adam, but we were grafted into Christ Rom 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This grafting was another birth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>John 1:12 says, As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we have been born of God, we are the offspring of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As such, we should branch out God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we walk according to the flesh, we branch out Adam, but if we walk according to the spirit, we branch out God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE BELIEVERS LIVING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>ISSUING IN ALL THE OTHER EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>OF THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In John 15 the Lord charges us only to abide in Him v. 4 . All the life and activity of the branches come from their abiding in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as the branches abide in the vine, the leaves, blossoms, and fruit will spontaneously come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the Lord emphasized not fruit-bearing but abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The crucial point is our abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not need to struggle to bear fruit, for fruit-bearing is an issue of our abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as we abide in Christ, the other experiences of the normal Christian life will automatically follow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, our unique need is to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The mutual abiding of the vine and the branches depicts the Triune God living in us so that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The revelation in John 15 is essentially the same as that in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Both reveal the focus of the universe and the center of the Bible the Triune God lives in us so that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This should also be the focus of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All we need to do is to live the Triune God; everything else will be a spontaneous issue of our living the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, nearly all Christians, including the great teachers, have missed this focus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The teachings of Thomas Kempis and Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis concerning bearing the cross, experiencing the subjective death of Christ, and following Jesus outside the camp have been influential among many seeking Christians but have erroneously led some to asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Other teachings emphasize the resurrection life, subjective sanctification, or holiness, and the victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For instance, an American brother, Charles G. Trumbull, wrote a book called The Life That Wins concerning the victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many books have been written concerning these matters and have influenced countless seeking Christians during the past few centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In my early Christian life I studied and was influenced by these books.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I endeavored to bear the cross, experience the subjective death of Christ, follow Jesus outside the camp, and exercise faith to experience the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I saw that these mystical teachings are higher than the merely ethical teachings of fundamental Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, I eventually discovered that the practices taught by the mystics are based on human effort and are therefore ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I also tried experiencing the spiritual gifts as practiced by the Pentecostals, such as speaking in tongues, and discovered that their practices were ineffective as well.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The experiences of the subjective death of Christ, the resurrection life, and the spiritual gifts are scriptural, but these experiences should be the spontaneous issue of the Triune God living in us and our living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We may use our physical body as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If our heart is not pumping, we cannot cause our members to function artificially.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, if our heart is pumping, we do not need to teach the nose to breathe, the ears to listen, or the eyes to see, for all our members will function spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The heart of the Christian life is the Triune God living in us and our living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As long as we live the Triune God by walking according to the spirit, all the other experiences of the normal Christian life, such as bearing the cross and participating in the resurrection life, will spontaneously come forth.</S>
