   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ATTENDING THREE IMPORTANT MEETINGS A WEEK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man is communal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christians are all the more communal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>None of us would like to live by himself on a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We like to see people and to speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we have the life of God within us, we spontaneously love other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot explain why this is so, but it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not matter what color skin they have, whether they are black, white, red, brown, or yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as they are brothers, we love them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some have asked me, Brother Lee, how many brothers and sisters do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How should I answer?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How many brothers and sisters do I really have?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>More than hundreds of thousands!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are countless!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Wherever I go today, I have brothers and sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christianity has robbed the Christians of this great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When they go to the worship service, even those sitting beside them would not acknowledge them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the service is over, everyone goes home.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I attended a worship service for two years in a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Besides the pastor, I did not talk to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was not the only one who was like that.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the others were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In that kind of setting, no one needs to speak to another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if you come to a home meeting with eight brothers sitting in a brother s living room, it would be impossible for you not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At least you have to greet each other.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once you greet each other, the blessing comes!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In time you begin to know me and I begin to know you, and we become acquainted with each other s condition and difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Spontaneously a mutual love and care will be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are many things that you can practice in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the big meetings you can not pray, but in the home meetings you can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the big meetings you cannot speak, but in the home meetings you can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the big meetings you cannot sing, but in the home meetings you can sing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All these are functions that cannot be fulfilled by the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason I advise you not to despise the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since we are saved and have become the children of God, we should not give up this blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I know that you are all very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the present arrangement of the church in Taipei there are not too many meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the Lord s Day morning there is a meeting to learn the truth; we must all go there to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Besides that, we have the Lord s table meeting on the Lord s Day evening; this is a meeting to remember the Lord, and it is very proper for us to attend that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Other than these two meetings we have a home meeting once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a must for all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Attending such home meetings will refresh us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For me to go now to a service to listen to a pastor speak for an hour is a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if I go to the home meeting, where I meet the brothers and sisters, where we pray, sing, and fellowship together, there is much refreshment, enjoyment, and satisfaction!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I hope all the brothers and sisters would attend these three important meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should learn the truths, remember the Lord, and build up one another through the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>OUR DESIRE FOR THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>ARISING FROM A FRESH LOVE TOWARDS THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If anyone does not love the home meetings, he must forgive me to say that he must have a problem with his love towards the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am afraid such a one does not really love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am not condemning you, picking on you, or exposing your shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I admit that you do love the Lord, but your love today is not fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I honestly believe that if your love towards the Lord is still fresh, you will surely love the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I myself have the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For a while I did not like to see the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I became tired of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Invariably my love towards the Lord was not fresh at such times.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, once I would pray a little, be enlightened a little in my prayer, and confess my sins and plead for the cleansing of the blood, I immediately would be refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The first thing that comes to me after I am refreshed is that I want to go to the meetings!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why I say that to be tired of the home meetings shows that our love towards the Lord is no longer fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Christian s experience, if there is a problem with one s daily life, his love towards the Lord will not be fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a symptom of a disease.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When your love towards the Lord is fresh, when you have such a sweet fellowship with Him in the morning, you wish that the evening would come sooner so that you may go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It seems as if you cannot wait until the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As soon as you finish with your business in the afternoon, you rush through your dinner so that you can make it to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But sometimes the situation is exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are afraid of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We do not want to see the faces of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It means that you are spiritually sick.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Sometimes, by the Lord s mercy, the sickness is over in three or five days.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if the sickness persists, then you must beware.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you are weak and underweight for a long time, and you cannot diagnose the problem, perhaps you have developed spiritual cancer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The best way is to go to the Lord to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once you contact Him, you will discover your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even our reluctance to go to meetings is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We will see that even our lack of prayer and our not walking according to the Spirit are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we would confess our sins before the Lord, we will be forgiven and there will be an immediate revival within.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once we are revived, we will want to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In simple terms, the key to the home meetings is a fresh love towards the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whenever we feel that we are not fresh, we must contact the Lord and confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>His blood will cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This cleansing is always effective; it is an instant cure.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Nothing will annul this law.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we would do this, we will live daily in the fellowship with the Lord.</S>
