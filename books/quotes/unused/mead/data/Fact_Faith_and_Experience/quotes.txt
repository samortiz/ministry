[1]  In the present age of grace, everything is by grace Eph 2:8 .
[2]  Everything being by grace means that everything is done by God.
[3]  Man does not have to do anything to be saved because to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due Rom 4:4 .
[4]  Because God deals with man according to grace, there are certain facts.
[5]  It is not to add anything to what He has finished, but to have man acknowledge that what God has done is real.
[6]  All those who sincerely accept the Lord Jesus as Lord and Savior, at the moment they believe, God accepts them as He accepted the Lord Jesus.
[7]  By these we become the same as He is before God, and God accepts us in the same way that He accepts the Lord.
[8]  Therefore, we must first acknowledge that God has indeed made the Lord Jesus our wisdom... righteousness and sanctification and redemption 1 Cor 1:30 , that all of the Lord s accomplishments and victories are our accomplishments and victories.
[9]  If we do not have this faith, not only can we never expect any spiritual experiences, but we are sinning against God and doubting His work!
[10]  There is no other way to experience all this except to acknowledge that Canaan is good; if we will realize every inch of God s land with the soles of our feet, we will indeed find ourselves inheriting the land that God has given to us.
[11]  Facts are God s promises, His redemption, His works, and His free gifts.
[12]  Faith denotes the way man believes in God, trusts in His work and redemption, and claims His promises.
[13]  It is a kind of working and attitude through which God s facts are transformed into man s experience.
[14]  Experience is the proper living of the believers, which they secure through believing in God.
[15]  Let us now explain the matter of fact, faith, and experience in relation to our dying with the Lord.
[16]  It is just as important for believers to know the matter of dying with the Lord as it is for sinners to know the matter of redemption.
[17]  Fact : When Christ died on the cross, not only did He die for the sinners, but the sinners died in Him as well.
[18]  After seeing these few verses, we can realize that in God s view the believers have been crucified with Christ on the cross already.
[19]  We are dead, we have been crucified with Him, and our death and our crucifixion with Him are facts, yet the Word of God goes on to charge us to reckon ourselves to be dead to sin Rom 6:11 .
[20]  Concerning victory over the world, the same thing applies.
[21]  Second, there is our faith, for the victory which has overcome the world is our faith 1 John 5:4 .
[22]  Facts are works of God; faith is our trust in God s works; while experience is the spiritual encounters in our life.
[23]  In order to experience the reality of the fact that God has prepared for us, all we need to do is exercise our faith to claim what the Lord has accomplished for us and to count it as our own.
[24]  Then, when temptation comes, we will live out these accomplishments as if we have already attained to the position the fact that the Lord has placed us in. If we do this, our experience will follow.
[25]  They come from: 1 acknowledging our sanctification, victory, and death to the self in the Lord Jesus Christ, and 2 practicing it by believing that one is joined to the Lord Jesus in life and that one will be as sanctified, victorious, and dead to the self as the Lord Jesus is.
[26]  When we believe in God s facts shown in the Bible and when we claim these facts, the Holy Spirit will apply to us all the graces that God has accomplished for us in Christ, making them real to us in our lives.
[27]  What we must do is acknowledge and claim these facts, trusting in the Holy Spirit to apply in our lives what God has accomplished so that we will have the spiritual experiences.
[28]  Every time I go to a place to preach God s gospel of grace, I always ask the local Christians one question.
[29]  I believe all those who can answer me with a clear yes are joyfully enjoying the grace of God.
[30]  In other words, do you really know that you are saved?
[31]  You should know whether you are a perishing man or a saved man who has obtained God s grace.
[32]  He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son.
[33]  I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God 1 John 5:9-13 .
[34]  This passage of the Scripture says that if we do not believe in the testimony that we have eternal life, then we are making God a liar.
[35]  If we are not, we should make haste to believe in Jesus Christ and come to God through trusting in His saving accomplishment for us.
[36]  When God says that we are saved, surely we are saved, whether we feel that we are saved or not.
[37]  Every time we consider the cross, it invokes wonder in us!
[38]  Every time we remember the redemption of the Lord Jesus, our hearts are filled both with sorrow and with joy.
[39]  To us the Lord s cross is not just a wooden cross, but a symbol of His full redemptive work and of the full salvation accomplished through this redemptive work.
[40]  When I first received the Lord, I often wondered how the men in the Old Testament, who came before the time of the Lord s crucifixion, could be saved.
[41]  If the blood of bulls and goats was not able to remove sin, as we mentioned earlier, how then were those in the Old Testament saved?
[42]  Why then did God promise in Leviticus 17 that the blood of creatures was able to redeem one from sin?
[43]  Although Christ had not yet died at the time of the first covenant, God intended that all the sacrifices offered at that time be a type of Christ.
[44]  If we believe in the Lord Jesus, which means that by faith we receive Him as the Savior, we will be saved.
[45]  Therefore, we sinners who have no righteousness of our own should acknowledge God s word as true and should act according to His word and believe in the cross of His Son and be saved.
[46]  Although the Bible says that the Lord Jesus offered up the sacrifice for sins once, it points out that having offered one sacrifice for sins, He sat down forever ...
[47]  The word one means that the Lord s sacrifice for sins was perfect; He only needed to redeem man from sins once.
[48]  When we consider how in eternity past God knew that He was to create man and that man would become fallen, we realize how His heart, humanly speaking, must have grieved over it.
[49]  God Himself knows the eternal worth of His Son s cross.
[50]  He has manifested to all the eternal freshness of the cross of His Son.
[51]  If we truly see the Lord s cross all the time, if we truly see how He suffered there, if we see the wounds on His hands and feet and the crown of thorns on His head, if we see how His love and blood mingled, and if we see His sufferings and sorrow, will we not be deeply moved, and will we not cease from doing things that do not please Him or cause Him sorrow?
[52]  But the righteous shall have life and live by faith Rom 1:17 .
[53]  This is the normal rule for the believers living.
[54]  But the Word of God says that the righteous shall have life and live by faith.
[55]  As a result, they cry out to God with their whole being, seeking for God as the deer seeks for a stream of water.
[56]  This source is not in the saints but in God.
[57]  If the source of faith were in the saints, faith would be fragile.
[58]  Many children of God sadly sigh over their lack of great faith.
[59]  We wish for greater faith so that we can trust God and He can perform daily miracles for us.
[60]  We wish for practical faith so that we can commit everything into the hand of God with ease and calmness.
[61]  If we really understood that God is the source of our faith, we would never ask ourselves, Do I have enough faith?
[62]  These questions indicate that we still do not understand that God is the source of our faith, because if we did, we would not ask these questions.
[63]  We should not ask or search to see if we have faith, and we should not trust in God only when we have faith.
[64]  If we think, I am not afraid now because I have faith, then we are trusting in our own faith and not trusting in God.
[65]  Likewise, if we say, I cannot commit these things to God because I have no faith, it does not mean that we do not believe in God.
[66]  The Bible not only tells us that God is the source of our faith; it also tells us that the word of God is the source of our faith: So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ Rom 10:17 .
[67]  All of these promises are real and can be enjoyed by every saint.
[68]  In the stories in the Bible, we see how God worked for His children and stretched forth His mighty arm to save, protect, and guide.
[69]  God never changes, and the words of His promises never change.
[70]  After considering all the work that God has done in the past, we realize that all of His promises in the present are faithful.
[71]  But if God does not change thank and praise Him that He never changes , the promises in the Bible will stand forever.
[72]  If we have faith in God, we should not just believe in Him when we encounter extraordinary events and face impossible tasks or absolute perils.
[73]  Not only should we know God as our sovereign Lord, but we should know Him like children know their father.
[74]  In the same way, faith without works is dead.
[75]  If our faith and works do not agree with each other, there must be something wrong with our faith.
[76]  Can that faith save him? v. 14 . According to the biblical teaching here, if we believe God in a certain matter, we should have a work of faith in that matter.
[77]  If we commit a matter to the Lord and believe that God will work for us, our attitude toward the matter will surely see a great change.
[78]  There must be works to our faith, and the first step of our work of faith is to stop our own works and rest in God s love, wisdom, and power.
[79]  In the Bible God demands faith of His children.
[80]  All spiritual blessings and arrangements in our circumstances can only be received through faith.
[81]  We marvel that God considers the faith of the believers so important.
[82]  Without exception, all the aspects of God s full salvation in the Bible are gained by faith.
[83]  One thing we know: God hates man s own works, whether they are those of a sinner or those of a saint.
[84]  Anything from ourselves, anything done independently of God, and anything done according to one s own intention by one s own strength, is hateful to God.
[85]  Therefore, anything not according to the will of the good God or anything not done through the power of the good God is not good; it is sin.
[86]  Hence, all that a believer does must be of God and through God.
[87]  Here the matter of faith comes in. Faith has two basic principles: 1 stopping man s own work and 2 waiting for God s work.
[88]  If we still use our own ability, power, friends, connections, and tact to labor, it means we have not yet realized our uselessness; we have not yet completely committed matters into the hand of God.
[89]  Inasmuch as the faith at our initial salvation was given by God Eph 2:8 , the faith in our daily life is also given by God.
[90]  But regardless of which kind of faith we have, faith should always have its manifestation in our conduct; there should always be rest for those who have faith; and there should also be no struggle and fleshly energy in trying to help God.
[91]  God wants to lead and guide us, as He did Abraham, into Canaan, a place full of idols and often in famine.
[92]  Everything in such an environment seems to speak contrary to God s promise, and it seems unlikely that God would have brought us to such a place.
[93]  CHAPTER TEN FAITH AND OBEDIENCE Scripture Reading: Rom 6:11-14
[94]  Today I will speak about the principles of Christian living.
[95]  The entire New Testament shows us that there are only two principles of Christian living; everything else is merely fruit that issues from these two principles.
[96]  In our fellowship with the Lord, we need faith and obedience every day.
[97]  Whenever God touches us on a certain point, and instead we want God to go along with us, we are not obeying God.
[98]  CHAPTER ELEVEN LIVING BY FAITH Scripture Reading: Heb 10:38
[99]  The word live in this verse can be translated two ways according to Greek.
[100]  Hebrews is written to the believers, those who are saved and have eternal life; therefore, the more accurate translation is live by faith.
[101]  God s purpose for doing all these things are:
[102]  When we read the Bible during a period of excitement and joy, we have a great interest in reading.
[103]  But are we reading the Bible because of our interest or because the Bible is the Word of God?
[104]  Is the purpose of our prayer to seek God in His presence, or is the goal the joy we feel in our prayer?
[105]  Are we praying at the expense of forsaking our duty, or are we praying for God s sake?
[106]  If we do all these things for ourselves and to satisfy ourselves, then our aim is not God s glory.
[107]  At the height of our excitement, we do not realize that we are doing these things for ourselves; we think that we are doing these things for God.
[108]  We have to realize that the times we are most excited, when we seem to be living on the mountaintop, perhaps are the times when we are in our flesh the most!
[109]  Under these conditions, God is teaching us a lesson; He makes us realize that our peak spiritual experiences are just something of ourselves.
[110]  God is testing us to see if we will keep praying, reading the Word, and testifying for Him during the times when the joy is gone and the dryness is present.
[111]  This cycle will continue until God arrives at His purpose when we realize that our desire for joy is for ourselves and not for God.
[112]  During the times when we are happy, when we feel that God is so near us that we can almost touch the Lord Jesus and God, we would rather lock ourselves in a room and not see anybody.
[113]  If you can overcome the feeling of dryness, you can overcome your environment.
[114]  The feeling of dryness is the most difficult to overcome.
[115]  If you exercise your will to say, I will read the Bible, I will pray, and I will testify, even though you are living a dry and parched life, you will find that you can overcome all kinds of environments, no matter how great they may be.
[116]  THE COURSE OF ENTERING INTO A TRUTH Scripture Reading: Heb 10:38
[117]  Two weeks ago I read many verses concerning living by faith.
[118]  Today I will continue with the matter of living by faith, which we began about two weeks ago.
[119]  They are unreliable because the God we trust has not changed, the work of the Lord has not changed, and the work of the Holy Spirit has not changed.
[120]  For example, we may have lost all taste for reading the Bible, we may not pray well, and we may feel that we do not have power in our work.
[121]  Mr. Frost then asked, Have you ever taken anything that you consecrated back, during the past years? He answered, No. Has your love for souls diminished? He answered again, No. Has your love for the Lord changed? The answer was again No. Have you become worldly? No. Have you decreased your work in saving souls? No. Mr. Frost then said, If you have all these things, why should you care about your feelings? What can the feelings do? This apparent failure of Mr. Taylor taught Mr. Frost a lesson that we should not care about our feelings as long as the intention of the heart is right.
[122]  A great number of people who have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior have discovered a new experience soon after they have believed: in their hearts it seems that there are two natures.
[123]  At the time we believed, He dispensed into us His own life, the life of God, with the nature of God.
[124]  Rather, it is the work of God s Holy Spirit in our spirit, recovering our spirit s lost position and installing God s life in our spirit.
[125]  This means that in our daily life, we should adopt the attitude that we are dead to the flesh, that we believe in God s word, and that we consider all God s words to be true.
[126]  While you are reading, you can exercise your faith to reckon yourself dead to sin, and you can pray that the Holy Spirit of the Lord will apply the cross of the Lord Jesus deeply in you, so that you can overcome sin in your experience.
[127]  If a saint does not cooperate with God by persisting in his opposition to Satan, if he does not ask the Lord for light to discern the real condition of the situation, or if he will not submit to God s words, then God cannot keep him.
[128]  If we are humble and not self-assuming or stubborn, if we admit that we can easily be deceived, if we single-heartedly seek the Lord so that He would reveal the real condition and true significance behind every matter, and if we wholeheartedly resist the works and wiles of the enemy, we will know if our spiritual experience is from God or from Satan.
[129]  In our prayer we may feel that the Lord is in the room and there is no need to pray to God in heaven, and instead we only need to pray to the Lord in the room.
[130]  If believers do not know and walk according to the law of God s work, God cannot keep us.
[131]  If God has not revealed the real condition behind a particular matter to us in our spirit and we have not actually tested whether it is from God, we must not assume that it has been given by God.
[132]  It is very easy for the heart to become cold; it is also extremely difficult for the head to remain calm.
[133]  In the twinkling of an eye, when we are just slightly unwatchful, our loving heart toward God and man spontaneously cools down.
[134]  Many times, the more we think, the more confused we become, and also the more we think, the hotter we become.
[135]  What you have not experienced cannot be called experience.
[136]  If scriptural teachings and doctrines are not experienced personally by us, they have nothing to do with us.
[137]  In regard to our real spiritual condition as Christians, we do not possess what we think but only what we have experienced.
[138]  Although they do not have a strong faith in the Lord that would cause them to pray unceasingly to Him and receive numerous miraculous and wonderful answers to their prayers from God, they wholeheartedly praise and admire this kind of spiritual experience.
[139]  We often hear God s children say that such and such a teaching in the Bible is essential, and such and such a teaching is nonessential.
[140]  If we exercise careful observation, we will find many who consider that questions related to their own salvation are essential teachings and questions unrelated to their salvation are nonessential teachings.
[141]  This is why we often hear people say, Do I have to obey the Lord in this matter?
[142]  The fact that something is merely a commandment of God and merely related to God s glory is not enough to motivate the saints to obey.
[143]  God has said that those who believe in the Lord Jesus have eternal life; therefore, since they have believed and received eternal life, believers think that there is no further need to be concerned with God s other commandments and will.
[144]  May we pay close attention to God s glory and truly care for His will in the same way that Paul declared all the counsel of God.
[145]  The conscience is God s voice of righteousness within man.
[146]  It is a part of the spirit, and its function is to rebuke everything that is not of God and against righteousness.
[147]  Many times, our conscience tells us clearly through intuition what is God s will, where it lies, and what it requires of us.
[148]  If they cannot obey God s will, they appease themselves by giving reasons for their disobedience to God, hoping to blunt the cutting edge of the knife and minimize their own hurt.
[149]  Bribing the conscience is proof that we know what we ought to do and that we know God s will, but we are unwilling to do it.
[150]  Only the One who is the highest can condescend to be the lowest.
[151]  The whole life of our Lord shows us that He condescended in this way.
[152]  When we read the four Gospels, we see a condescending life unfold before us.
[153]  There are many aspects to His condescension, but the most beautiful one is His co-working with His creatures and employing them to be the instruments for His work.
[154]  It is an absolute mistake to think that when we offer ourselves and what we have to God that we are doing God a favor or earning credits from God.
[155]  SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE Scripture Reading: John 3:16; 14:16; 15:4-5; 14:17; 6:47; 4:14; 1 John 2:8; Phil 1:20-21; 1 Cor 1:30; Col 1:27
[156]  We often speak about the matter of subjective truth and objective truth.
