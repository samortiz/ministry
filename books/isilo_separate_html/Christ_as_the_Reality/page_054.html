The first is fornication. In the past five or six years, I have heard much concerning this matter. Among today&#8217;s young people, especially the so-called hippies, there are innumerable cases of fornication. They live just like animals. They do not even care for this word, &#8220;fornication.&#8221; I believe that in their dictionary they do not have such a word. It is all done without shame. In the whole Bible, the greatest and most sinful act in God&#8217;s eyes is idol worship. Fornication is second. Idol worship is an insult to God, and fornication is a damage to humanity. God created humanity for His divine purpose, but Satan damages this humanity by fornication.<p>On some occasions, the Lord Jesus tore down all of the rituals and ordinances of the Old Testament. But He did not tear down the law concerning fornication; rather He enforced it even the more. When the Pharisees spoke with Him about divorce, the Lord asserted that Moses had allowed them to divorce their wives because of the hardness of their hearts, but it was not so at the beginning (Matt. 19:3-9). The Lord enforced the commandment regarding fornication much more than it had been in the Old Testament times (Matt. 5:27-28). This is because nothing damages our humanity like fornication. Paul says that any act we commit is outside our body, but fornication damages our body (1 Cor. 6:18). Oh, the enemy is so subtle! He first injects so many devilish concepts into the mentality of the young people, and the first issue of this is fornication.<p>I would like to say a word to the young people. I am not speaking my own idea, but something from the divine Word. You young brothers and sisters should not enter into marriage so quickly, so lightly, and so easily. You must realize that marriage is a very holy relationship (Heb. 13:4). No marriage should be broken (Matt. 19:6, 9). Anyone who breaks the marriage bond is exceedingly sinful to God. You must take the matter quite seriously to the Lord. Once you are married, you should never be divorced. Nothing offends the Lord so much as a wrong marriage, and nothing damages our humanity more than fornication. It is not just a moral matter; it is a matter of damaging the humanity which God created for His purpose.<p>I believe that many of you are acquainted with the cesspool of fornication existing among so many young people today. Three years ago when I was in San Francisco, I heard many detailed reports concerning this situation. I simply could not stand it. To me this is not human life, but animal life.<h2 class=head2>The Second Issue: Suicide</h2><p>The second issue of the devilish concepts indoctrinated into young people&#8217;s minds is to commit suicide. If you study the proper statistics, you will see that the number of suicides is much larger than it was five years ago. In the earlier years of my ministry I hardly ever heard someone tell me that he wanted to end his life. But in these last few years, a number of young believers have come to me and expressed such an intention. Where did this kind of thinking originate? Undoubtedly Satan has indoctrinated the mentality of the young people with this concept. We all must pray and stand against such subtlety of the enemy. Satan&#8217;s whole purpose is to damage humanity so that man cannot be used for God&#8217;s purpose.<h2 class=head2>The Third Issue: Mental Illness</h2><p>The third issue of the indoctrination of devilish concepts is mental illness. If you will check with today&#8217;s younger generation, you will see that so many do not have a strong mind. Their way of thinking and their concepts are altogether unsound and unhealthy. Paul says in 2 Timothy 1:7 that God has given us a spirit of a sound mind. We must be exceedingly healthy in our thinking, concepts, and ideas. We need to have a sound mind.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
