   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A CHART OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the kingdom is one of the most complicated subjects in the Bible, the chart on pages 76 through 77 will be a great help to our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first and last circles of the chart are colored golden yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Gold signifies God or what is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These two circles represent eternity past and eternity future.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The dispensation of law refers to the Israelites, lasting from Moses to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please notice the columns at the bottom of the chart with the verse references and explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From Christ's first coming to His second coming is the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the Lord Jesus will return to set up His kingdom on this earth; this will be the kingdom of a thousand years, the millennium, the dispensation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The circles entitled "The Dispensation of Grace" and "The Dispensation of the Kingdom" are colored blue, signifying the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Heaven is always signified by the color blue.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The last circle is colored golden yellow, but it is quite different from the golden yellow circle of eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In eternity future is the New Jerusalem, which is a composition of all the saints from all the preceding dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some will be from the patriarchs, some from the Israelites, some from the church, and some also from the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the saints, from these four dispensations will be gathered together as the ultimate consummation, the New Jerusalem.</S>
