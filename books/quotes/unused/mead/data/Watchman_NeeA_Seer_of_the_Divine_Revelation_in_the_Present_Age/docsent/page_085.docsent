   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From the nineteenth issue of The Present Testimony, published in January February 1931, the following excerpt is taken:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My illness during the last two or three years has surely been used by God to test the compassions of many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My weakness has become the opportunity for many to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I consider your love and kindness toward me, how grateful I am!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I hear of the many brothers and sisters scattered in different places who, though they have not met me, yet because of our relationship in the Lord, have wept bitterly before Him for my health, I feel that what you have bestowed upon me is so deep while that which I have given you is so shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of this I cannot help feeling that if I had more life, energy, and time, how much I would like to spend it on the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Though my sickness has been accumulating over many years, it was worsened by writing The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank God, now I am recovering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am again able to write a few letters, prepare a few articles, lead several Bible study sessions, and attend a few meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are still many other things I could wish to do but cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Still I am thankful to God for what I can do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who know the human body say that I have been close to death several times, but thank God He has been keeping me up to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope that in the days of my sojourning on this earth I may be able to serve Him and you faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The following excerpt is taken from the twenty-fifth issue of The Present Testimony, of May June 1932:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the last few months, due to heart disease and other physical illness, my earthly tent is again in danger of collapsing at any moment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times I tarry at the fork of the road, not knowing what way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Humanly speaking, in many experiences I do not know whether to cry or laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But thank the Lord, for the Lord's sake nothing is too difficult and no price is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the eyes of those who trust and obey, a dark, cloudy situation is still a bright and clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those lines are true: "If there's less of earth-joy, give, Lord, more of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let the spirit praise Thee, though the heart be riven."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
