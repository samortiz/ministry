   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD HIMSELF BECOMING A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to carry out His economy, at a certain time God Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In so doing, He brought God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is the tree of life; when He came, He brought the tree of life into man John 15:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, God, the tree of life, and man were united into one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This One is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not believe that anyone has ever told you that the tree of life was brought into man when God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We dare to say this because when He was on the earth, He said, "I am the life" 11:25; 14:6 , and He also said, "I am the true vine" 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you put these two statements together, you can see that this Jesus as the God-man was a union of man with the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>TERMINATING THE OLD CREATION AND GENERATING THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This incarnated God-man lived on the earth for over thirty years expressing God fully.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then He died on the cross and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His death He completely terminated the degraded, deteriorated, corrupted, and rotten old creation Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His resurrection He generated God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through His death He put an end to God's old creation, and through His resurrection He brought forth God's new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The new creation is not shared by all the people in the world; it is centered on the people chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The archangel was the center of the original creation, and then Adam was the center of the restored creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now in the new creation the men chosen by God are the center.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His new creation, God has resurrected, that is, has regenerated, all His chosen ones together with Christ Eph 2:5; Col 2:13 through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, in His resurrection Christ did such a great thing He regenerated all of God's chosen ones 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, in His resurrection Christ also uplifted the humanity which He had put on and brought it into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, He was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection Rom 8:29; Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The God-chosen ones whom He regenerated as His many brothers became the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the teachings of the New Testament, the many sons of God and the firstborn Son of God are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New Testament teachings are altogether on the matters concerning the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, the old creation was dealt with by the firstborn Son of God in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He died on the cross, He brought the old creation with Him and dealt with it there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, He redeemed the God-created man, the man whom God desired to save.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His resurrection and through His resurrection He brought forth, regenerated, all the ones in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then in time God calls them out and saves them out of every nation and from every place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have all been set apart by the Holy Spirit and redeemed by God, and they have received Christ and have thereby become regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These sanctified, redeemed, and regenerated ones are the believers in Christ.</S>
