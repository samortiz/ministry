Raised Up by God</h2><p>In Deuteronomy 18:15 Moses said, &ldquo;Jehovah your God will raise up for you a Prophet from your midst, from among your brothers, like me; you shall listen to Him.&rdquo; Here it indicates that Moses&rsquo; being a prophet was not of his own doing or of his own making; he was raised up by God. So also is Christ as God&rsquo;s Prophet.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Speaking for God, Speaking forth God,<br />and Revealing God to His Elect</h2><p>Deuteronomy 18:18 says: &ldquo;A Prophet will I raise up for them from the midst of their brothers like you; and I will put My words in His mouth, and He will speak to them all that I command Him.&rdquo; Moses was raised up by God as God&rsquo;s prophet. In his forty years of leading the children of Israel, he was God&rsquo;s spokesman, speaking for God to them all that God commanded him. Likewise, when Christ was on the earth, He spoke to His disciples for God; His teaching was not His but was according to what the Father had taught Him (John 7:16; 8:28b). He did not speak from Himself; as the Father said to Him, so He spoke (John 12:49-50). As God&rsquo;s Prophet, He spoke for God, spoke forth God, and revealed God to the disciples. Today He is still in us speaking for God, speaking forth God, and speaking God into us.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Moses is a type of Christ as the Apostle who brought God to us and the Prophet who spoke forth God. Moses typifies Christ as the Apostle who was sent by God and who came from God and with God to deliver us from the usurpation of Satan and the satanic world. Moreover, He was faithful to God in all God&rsquo;s house to bring God to us and to bring us into the rich supply of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Christ as the Builder of God&rsquo;s house is God and has more honor and has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, who was built as a part of God&rsquo;s house. Furthermore, although Moses was an honorable servant of God, he was merely a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God. However, Christ as the Son of God is not only building up God&rsquo;s house but also ruling over and taking care of it, carrying it on with Him to walk and move with God the Father.</p><p>Moses typifies Christ as the Prophet of God.
