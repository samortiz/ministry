   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Lacking Inward Reality in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Religion is vanity because it lacks inward reality in spirit 2:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 2:29 says that whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have must all be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are a Jew and are circumcised, your circumcision must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you are a Christian and are baptized, your baptism must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirit here, of course, is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why must everything be done in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because our spirit is the very place within us where God can dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The spirit is the site, the ground where God can act on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are a Christian in your spirit, this means you are a Christian with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you act in your spirit, this means you act with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without God, everything is vain; with Him, everything is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we must return to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we love other people, we must love them in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Otherwise, our love is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a political love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if we love in our spirit, our love is with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you husbands tell your wives that you love them, you need to say this with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If your love is not in the spirit, it is a fraud, a political love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many wives have been cheated by their husband s political love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I say a word to you, I must say it in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then that word will be a word with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, it will be political talk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our spirit is the organ through which God can touch us and through which we can touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything we are and everything we do must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not religion; this is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>F. Doing Evils as the Unreligious</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, the religious people practice the same evils as the unreligious 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems that there is no difference between the unreligious people and the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the Jews were religious, they behaved even worse than the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this portion on the condemnation of the religious, we see that religion means nothing, that it is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we must stay away from religion and have nothing to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need the living Person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE CONDEMNATION ON ALL THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE TOTALITY OF HOPELESSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we come to the condemnation on all the world, a condemnation that unfolds the totality of hopelessness 3:9-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The world situation is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not try to cure it, correct it, or improve it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Give up your hope.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The world condition is incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this section of Romans, Paul portrays man as totally evil and gives several proofs that the condition of the world is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not one person seeks God and no one understands God 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All have turned away from God and have become useless 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one is righteous 3:10 and no one practices good 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, there is not one righteous man and not one good man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you know the difference between a righteous man and a good man?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I work for you for one month at a salary of five hundred dollars per month and you refuse to pay me, you are unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, if you pay me, you are a righteous man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I did not work for you at all and you gave me five hundred dollars as a gift when I needed it, that would be an act of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you did this, you would be a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, Paul says that among all the human beings in the world not one is righteous and not one is good.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do you believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not think of ourselves as exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No one is righteous; no one is good.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, everyone has become subject to the judgment of God 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The condition of the world is totally hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Where were we before we were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We were all under the righteous judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everyone of us was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not one of us sought God or understood God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everyone of us had turned aside and had become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not one of us was righteous or good.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We were all under the righteous judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By this we can see the hopeless condition of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I appreciate Paul s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the section on condemnation we see the source of wickedness, the way of restriction, the vanity of religion, and the hopeless condition of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Here is the conclusion of Paul s writings on condemnation: the whole world is subject to the righteous judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Where would we be and what would we be if we were not yet saved?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We would be a hopeless case under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Regardless of what we did, what we had, and what we were, we were under God s righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We all realized our need for God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This section on condemnation paves the way for God s salvation and opens up the door for people to enter into God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Regardless of who we are, we need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need Christ with His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul s intention in the section on condemnation was to prepare the way for him to minister Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The ultimate goal of Paul s gospel is to minister Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we come to Romans 8, we will find a verse that says, Christ is in you 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is Paul s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whether we are one of mankind, one of the self-righteous, one of the religious people, or a person in the world, we need Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our need is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not pay attention to outward things or outward doings, but turn ourselves to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There in the spirit we will meet Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the spirit we will enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Paul s writing on condemnation paves the way for us to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It opens the way for Christ to come into us.</S>
