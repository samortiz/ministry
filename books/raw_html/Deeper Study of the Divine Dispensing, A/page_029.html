<h2 class=head2>On the Positive Side—Sanctifying, Transforming, Conforming, and Redeeming</h2><p>The dispensing of the Divine Trinity as the law of the Spirit of life in us, the believers, results not only in our being delivered from the negative things and subduing them, but it supplies us positively in our spirit, soul, and body. First, it sanctifies us. This sanctification is not only a positional sanctification, but a dispositional transformation. It comes about through the saturation of our whole being with God’s holy nature by the Divine Trinity as the Spirit of life, transforming our natural element into a spiritual element, so that every part of our whole being can be sanctified unto God (Rom. 6:19, 22). Second, our minds are renewed (Rom. 12:2b). The renewing of the mind is the basis of the transformation of the soul. It is the result of our setting our mind on the spirit. While the law of the Spirit of life is dispensing within us, a new essence is added into us, producing a metabolic change which makes us suitable for the practice of the church life. Third, every part of our soul is transformed. Since our mind is the main part of our soul, when our mind is renewed, the will and the emotion, which are the other parts that together with the mind form the soul, are spontaneously renewed also. By this, every part of our soul is transformed (Rom. 12:2b).<p>Fourth, this law of the Spirit of life becomes a mold within us, conforming us to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29a). Every life has its structure, shape, and form. As the law of the Spirit of life, the Triune God also has His image, which is the image of the firstborn Son of God. If we walk according to the law of the Spirit of life, He will continually operate in us until we are sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of Christ. Christ is God’s firstborn Son, and in the end, we will become His many sons, being exactly the same as the firstborn Son, Christ (Rom. 8:29b).<h2 class=head1>THE PROCESS OF SANCTIFICATION, RENEWING, TRANSFORMATION, CONFORMATION, AND GLORIFICATION</h2><p>Finally, our whole being will be saturated by the divine glory, which means that our body will be redeemed (Rom. 8:30b, 23). When Christ comes again, we will receive the full sonship, which is the transfiguration of our body to be the same as His glorious body. Since man fell, his body has degenerated; it can sin, it can commit evil, and it can become tired and sick. The last step of the work of the Triune God as the law of the Spirit of life in us is to redeem our body. According to the principle whereby God regenerates us in our spirit through His Spirit, our body of sin, which is of death and which is mortal, will be fully saturated by the glory of His life and nature. The result is that this body will be transfigured and will become the same as the resurrected and glorious body of His Son. This is the ultimate step of His full salvation.<p>From this we can see that the Lord’s salvation is simply the Lord Himself. He has been processed, having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, entering into us to be a law. This is a tremendous thing. When I was young, I read of the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8, but I did not understand what it was. Hence, I was not able to say anything about it. After many years, not only have I gained a deeper knowledge, but I have more practical experiences. Now, together with what I have read from others’ biographies and the confirmation of their experiences, I am able to speak about this matter.<p>When the law of the Spirit of life regulates within us, it anoints upon us the divine element of God. This can be compared to painting; we have to apply the paint layer by layer. The more we paint, the more layers of paint there will be. The Triune God is anointing us unceasingly in this way, bringing into us the element of God so that we grow and are transformed. This is what Paul meant when he said that we grow “with the growth of God” (Col. 2:19).
