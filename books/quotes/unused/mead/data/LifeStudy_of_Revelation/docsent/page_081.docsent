   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WORTHY LION-LAMB A. The Lion of the Tribe of Judah</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While John was weeping, one of the elders said to him, Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This refers to Genesis 49:8-9, where Christ is portrayed as a lion, which is a symbol of Him as a strong fighter against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have pointed out that nearly everything in Revelation is a fulfillment of what is mentioned in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the fighting, victorious, and overcoming Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has won the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, His overcoming qualifies Him to open the scroll and its seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the angel told John to behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, verse 6 says, I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The angel recommended Christ as the Lion, but John saw Him as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Lion, He is the Fighter against the enemy; as the Lamb, He is the Redeemer for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has fought to redeem us, and He has won the battle over the enemy and accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To the enemy, He is a Lion; to us, He is a Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the angels do not need redemption, they need someone to defeat the enemy of God, for one among them became God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus the angels realize that there is a need for someone to defeat this rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To the angels, Christ was the Lion who defeated the rebel, but to us, including the apostle John, Christ is the Lamb, the redeeming One.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we have already pointed out, in the universe there are two main problems Satan and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Lion, Christ has defeated and destroyed Satan, and as the Lamb, He has taken away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has won the victory and He has accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now He is the Lion-Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 6 reveals that the Lamb is standing in the midst of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As far as redemption is concerned, Christ sat down after His ascension at the right hand of God in heaven Heb 1:3; 10:12 , whereas, regarding the carrying out of God s administration, He is still standing in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. The Root of David</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 5 Christ is given the title, the Root of David.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This title He is also the root of David s father Jesse, Isa 11:1 signifies that Christ is the source of David.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, as His forefather, David called Him the Lord Matt 22:42-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the root of David.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our concept, Christ was born of David, so He was a descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But here it says that Christ is the root of David, meaning that David grows out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible also says that Christ is the branch of David Jer 23:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, He is both the root and the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Isaiah 11:1 and 10 we see that Christ is also a branch and root of Jesse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have seen that Christ is both a descendant and the root of David.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the eyes of God, David was the unique person who fought the battle and gained authority, fighting the battle for God and gaining His full authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That Christ, the Lion-Lamb, is the root of this person means that He is greater than David.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why He holds the key of David 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever David was, had, and did was altogether out of this root.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, as the root of David, Christ is more powerful and more victorious than David and has more of God s divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. The Slain Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 6 John said that he saw a Lamb standing as having been slain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the Greek, having been slain indicates that the Lamb has just recently been slain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When John saw Christ as the Lamb, He had been freshly slain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This also indicates that the scene in heaven depicted in this chapter is immediately after Christ s ascension into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>D. Having Overcome</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Christ has overcome Satan, the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He has solved this problem for God and has removed the hindrances to the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, He is worthy to open the scroll concerning God s economy.</S>
