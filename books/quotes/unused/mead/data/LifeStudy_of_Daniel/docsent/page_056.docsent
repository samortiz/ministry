   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DANIEL MESSAGE THIRTEEN HUMAN GOVERNMENT FIGHTING AGAINST GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND BEING CRUSHED BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN HIS COMING WITH HIS BRIDE Scripture Reading: Dan 2:31-35, 41-44; Rev 19:7-9, 11-21; 17:14</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not study the Word or understand the Word in a natural way but study and understand it according to the Lord's revelation and enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To see that Daniel prayed three times a day does not require enlightenment, but to see God's economy in the book of Daniel requires vision, revelation, and enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we need vision, revelation, and enlightenment, Paul prayed that the Father would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also need the proper interpretation of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message I would like to give a further word concerning the problem presented to God by human government.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My burden is to point out that eventually human government will fight against God and will be crushed by Christ in His coming with His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>ANTICHRIST AND HIS TEN KINGS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>FIGHTING AGAINST GOD DIRECTLY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the great human image described in Daniel, the head was of gold, the breast and the arms were of silver, the abdomen and thighs were of bronze, the legs were of iron, and the feet and the toes were partly of iron and partly of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Apparently, the parts that were of gold, silver, bronze, and iron were not a problem to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But with the ten toes there is a great problem, for when human government reaches the stage of the ten toes the stage of Antichrist and his ten kings it will fight against God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, human government not only rebels against God, exalts man, and worships idols but also fights against God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, Christ, the embodiment of God, will come with His bride to crush the human government.</S>
