	 <h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In every place where the spread is going on, there are about forty to fifty newly baptized believers. The four full-timers need to work on these new ones until they are stable. The full-timers should persistently work on them step by step. After that the full-timers can knock on doors and gain more new ones. The number of new ones should increase steadily over time. We hope that after four months there will be about forty saints in each locality who are regular and steady in the church life. We can then move two of the full-timers to another place, and two can remain in the new locality for the long term. We hope that in every locality some saints would be produced as responsible ones and that several suitable homes would be available for the church life. These new saints will be able to bear the local burden with the serving ones.</p>
<p>As we said earlier, accommodations in the twelve new bases are ready for the second wave of full-timers; hence, the second wave can set out immediately. Twelve teams with six members each will labor in these twelve places for four months. In other words, a total of seventy-two persons will labor in twelve bases for four months. This means that after four months we will have spread to a total of twenty-seven new places on the island of Taiwan. There are four full-timers stationed in each of the initial fifteen places, and the twelve new places will have six full-timers each. Each of the first fifteen places had two people laboring in them for two months, and they will have four people laboring in them for another four months. In this way the manpower is balanced and evenly distributed in every place. This is the situation of the twenty-seven new places for the spread.</p>
<p>If we continue spreading according to this pattern, in 1991 we will conclude this stage in the work of evangelizing Taiwan. There will be one hundred newly established churches and two full-time serving ones in every church for a total of two hundred full-timers. We began with one hundred full-timers and an additional thirty full-timers joined them. We need to continue adding more full-timers until there are two hundred full-timers laboring in the new churches. We should send the full-timers out in waves. In 1991 there will be one hundred new churches with two serving ones stationed in every church. This will bring us to the end of the first stage of evangelizing Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE GOSPEL OVERSEAS</h2>
<p>By the end of 1991 there will be two hundred trained young brothers and sisters in one hundred new churches. Depending on our need and the situation, we will then decide whether we should continue the spread. We are presently laboring mainly in larger townships that have a population of over thirty thousand people. Later we will labor in the towns that have a population of over ten thousand people. In most of these smaller towns people tend to be scattered instead of living in clusters; hence, we feel that it may not be effective to establish bases for the work in these towns. Our future direction will be to use the one hundred churches as bases and spread out from them. This will be the second stage of evangelizing Taiwan.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the full-timers who graduate from the full-time training will most likely stay in Taipei. We hope that they will form teams of six to labor in the various communities in Taipei, just like the full-timers who are laboring in the towns and villages. The labor of the full-timers in Taipei to gain enough fruit for a district meeting will be equivalent to establishing a church in one of the towns. Furthermore, the newly trained graduates can also replace those who have labored six months or longer in the towns and villages. This will release some from the first wave of full-timers to go overseas. The United States will be the first place that they will go to labor overseas. All the full-timers should be prepared to learn either English or Spanish. Then after the full-timers have labored in America for a few years, perhaps some can go to the Spanish-speaking countries where there is a vast field for the work.</p>
<p>There are many colleges and universities in Taiwan, and people on this small island live in a clustered environment. This makes it easy to spread the gospel and to gain college graduates who can receive the full-time training. This spontaneously makes Taiwan a place that can produce full-time workers. I believe that in six or seven years there will be three to five hundred full-timers going out from Taiwan; some will go to North America, others to Central and South America, and still others to Africa. In this way we will be able to evangelize not only Taiwan but also the Americas and even all of Africa. This is a good prospect, and we should all endeavor toward this prospect. In particular, those who are laboring on the campuses in Taiwan need to gain college students with this in view.</p>
<p>We hope that the full-time training will produce at least sixty full-timers every year. After five or six years three to five hundred saints will have gone through the training. These saints should go to various places for the spread of the gospel. The &ldquo;apprentices&rdquo; can be produced in Taiwan. After these apprentices receive the training, they will go to the towns and villages to labor for six months to one year, and then they will go to labor overseas. Every new group of apprentices who are raised up will follow in the footsteps of those who have gone before them. This will be a blessing to the island of Taiwan. We hope that in relation to this spread all the churches will be in coordination and that all the co-workers will understand that this is our goal. Then the churches in Taiwan can enter into an atmosphere of propagation and increase for God&rsquo;s pleasure and satisfaction. Furthermore, through this process some saints will mature in their experience and growth in life, and their human experience will reach a certain measure of maturity. The trainees who mature can be sent overseas to evangelize Latin America and Africa. May the Lord fulfill this plan.</p>
