   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Inwardly by the Working of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even if we do understand we still say, How am I going to handle this?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Oh, I don t know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, you begin to groan, and while you are groaning, the Spirit groans in your groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I came to this portion of the Word as a young man I said, I have never heard the groaning of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When did He groan for me?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, I discovered that in this chapter whatever we do the Spirit also does.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we cry, Abba, Father, the Spirit cries also.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When your spirit witnesses within you, the Spirit also witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, when you groan the Spirit also groans.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why do we groan?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we feel suffering and do not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It seems that the Holy Spirit gives you no utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are ignorant, and the Holy Spirit in like manner seems to be ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You do not know how to pray, and the Spirit also appears not to know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit prays in your manner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You groan, and He groans also.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You groan with hardly any purpose, but the Spirit groans in your groaning with a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This purpose cannot be uttered by you, but it can be uttered by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if He would utter it, you would not understand, for it would be a divine, heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since it is difficult for you to understand, the Spirit gives no utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, there is a purpose in it all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit groans in your groaning in order that you may be fully molded and conformed to the image of God s firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When many saints encounter hardship they say, I just don t know why this happens to me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why does this happen to me?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that we have all said this or asked this many times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even you who have recently been saved perhaps have already spoken in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why do certain things happen to you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the groaning Spirit prayed for them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although you do not know the purpose, He knows, and He prays according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the pattern, and the Spirit prays that everything which happens to you will mold you into this pattern, into the image of the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only does the Holy Spirit groan within us in this way; we also may pray for others in this manner.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have experienced this a number of times in my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I recall the case of a dear brother who loved the Lord greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, he had a very peculiar disposition, and no one could tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we prayed for him saying, Lord, here is such a dear brother with fine potential.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is such good material.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord, he loves You.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But no one can bear his peculiar disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Lord, You take care of this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You know our brother s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we realized that praying in this way is quite serious we simply said, Lord, You take care of this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Lord, You know our brother s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After a period of time the brother became ill and began to lament, I don t know why this has happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Immediately he asked his wife to contact the elders and to request that they visit him for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We went.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first sentence out of his mouth was, Brothers, you know my situation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I don t know why this has happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Deep within we, like the Holy Spirit, knew why he was suffering; however, we did not dare to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We simply spoke in our brother s manner, O brother, why has this happened to you?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That was all we could say.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the brother asked us to pray with him, we did not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We simply said, O Lord Jesus, why has this happened to our brother?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although deep within we did know the reason, all we could say was, Lord, do Your best.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This did not offend him because he also expected the best, and he said, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He understood our prayer in one way, and we understood it in another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We were thinking, Lord, do Your best to deal with him, to subdue him, to burn him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although we did not dare say this, we had such a purpose within us, a purpose which we could not express at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nevertheless, God who searches the hearts answered that prayer, a prayer that was according to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The brother s difficulty continued and the illness lingered for another period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was very troubled and asked his wife to send for us again.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We went and asked along with him, O brother, why has this illness lasted for such a time?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once again we were inwardly clear, but did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When he asked us to pray, we simply prayed, O Lord, we still ask You to do the best.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Praise the Lord that after another period of time this brother s situation changed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Firstly he had some amount of deliverance from his disposition; then he was healed of his illness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Finally he could shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now I know.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now I know.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Why does the Spirit groan in us with words which cannot be uttered?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He groans that we may be molded, conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is much easier to speak about sanctification in life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, accompanying sanctification is the matter of conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We not only need to be sanctified, to be saturated with what God is, but also to be molded.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We may be separated from everything common and saturated with God s holy nature, but still lack this conformity.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Sanctification probably does not require any suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Conformation, on the contrary, needs suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In sanctification there is no pattern, only a change in disposition, in nature, but in conformation there is a mold by which we are conformed to the image of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Along with this mold is the pressure and the molding and the mixing with water and the burning with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If the dough, the fine white flour, could speak, it would say, What a suffering this is to me.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You mix me with other things, you press me, and you even put me in an oven to burn me.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The entire process of cooking is a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>That is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Without suffering we cannot be molded into the pattern.</S>
