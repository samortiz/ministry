   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN GOD S PREDESTINATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 5 says that God the Father predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the Father s life has not come into us, how can we be His sons?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sonship requires that we be saturated with the Father s life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are neither God s sons-in-law nor His adopted sons; we are sons in God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because we have been born of God and because God has been born into us, we have God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This implies that God the Father is working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The only way we can be God s sons is for Him to dispense Himself into us and then work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah, we are God s sons, born of Him!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>IN THE SEALING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As believers, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit v. 13 . The Spirit is the Triune God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God in the heavens is the Father, but God coming to us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit is the seal of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means that God has been dispensed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have pointed out that this seal is living and moving within us; the Spirit is constantly sealing us with God s essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be sealed in this way is to be saturated with all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the sealing of the Holy Spirit also indicates that God is being wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This subjective realization of the Spirit s sealing is neglected by Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Most Christians have objective teachings, but not the subjective experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through the sealing of the Spirit, God is working His essence into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN THE HOPE OF GOD S CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 18 speaks of the hope of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One aspect of our hope is that we shall be transfigured and glorified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This transfiguration and glorification is the result of our being saturated with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Unless God saturates our entire being, including our body, we cannot be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This also refers to the dispensing of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once again we see that God is dispensing and working Himself into His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the governing concept of chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>V. IN THE GLORY OF GOD S INHERITANCE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>IN THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians 1:18 also speaks of the riches of the glory of God s inheritance in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God is not wrought into the saints, how can they ever become His inheritance, His peculiar possession?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The saints become so precious to Him by being saturated with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only in this way can poor sinners become God s special treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this universe God is the only One who is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now this precious God of matchless worth is working Himself into us to make us His glorious inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the New Jerusalem comes, we shall see that it will be altogether a valuable inheritance, shining with God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, the fact that the saints are becoming God s glorious inheritance, a precious treasure to Him, indicates that He is working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>IN THE POWER THAT ENABLES US</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>TO PARTICIPATE IN CHRIST S ATTAINMENT</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Triune God is dispensed into us and wrought into our being in the transmission of the divine power to enable us to participate in Christ s attainment so that we may be His Body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ s attainment is the highest attainment in the universe, for He has accomplished creation; passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection; and ascended to the right hand of God in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All this attainment is to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have pointed out, the words to the church in verse 22 imply a transmission, which is an act of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever Christ has passed through, accomplished, obtained, and attained is now being transmitted into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christians today do not have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, they are filled with ethical teachings and preoccupied with them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason we need to emphasize the fact that the Triune God is seeking to saturate us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose red ink is injected into the center of a ball of cotton.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Little by little, the cotton soaks up the ink.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this way, the ink gradually saturates the ball of cotton.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are like the cotton ball.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One day the heavenly red ink was deposited into the center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>From that time onward, the ink, God Himself, has been saturating us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our responsibility now is not to imitate the ink or to copy it; on the contrary, it is to soak it up, that is, to be saturated with it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By being thoroughly saturated with the heavenly ink, we become the ink; for the ink is assimilated into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This basic concept of the New Testament has been missed in today s Christian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we grasp this basic concept, our Christian life will be revolutionized and our concepts will be radically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We participate in Christ s attainment that we may become His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Selection, predestination, sealing, hope, glory, power all are for the Body.</S>
