   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Region of Ping-Yang</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sister X:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The recent war clouds over Chekiang province are getting more tense.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While Wenchow and Ping-Yang are still quiet, it is hard to tell what changes the future will bring.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The brothers and sisters are living peacefully day by day through relying on the Lord's grace; they are not frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, some brothers are having difficulties with their living, because business and industry have stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Praise and thank the Lord that in this difficult time the gospel work has an open door in every place, even though all occupations have stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the last two weeks we few co-workers in the Bai-Sha region of Jiang-Nan held seven gospel meetings during the night .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes we borrowed someone's house, and sometimes we held the meetings in the open air.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The number of attendants was more than one hundred every time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes it exceeded three or four hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The degree of concentration and attention among the attendants was unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We deeply believe that we will soon see some children of God raised up in this audience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we will begin to have several weeks of continuous gospel work in the area around Hu-Shan and in the region of Chao-Yang-Shan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We made this decision in our prayer long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the beginning of this work, we really felt weak and did not know how to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can only look to God with fear and trembling for His timely grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please do not forget to pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Chai Chi is often physically weak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the grace and peace of the Father be with you always.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Greet Brother Watchman Nee, Brother Lan Tsi-yi, and all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Chen Ching-fa</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>November 30, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Two Letters from Brother Han Fu-sheng One</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Tsi-yi:</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We left Hankow on the sixteenth of last month and arrived at Lin-Tze-Kou after three days.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The boat of the T'ai Ku company could not proceed because the water was too shallow, so they hired a local boat to take us to Yuan-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yuan-Jiang usually has a small steamer that goes to Ch'ang-Teh, but it has not been selling tickets recently, and we heard of robberies along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We stayed in an inn for two days.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later, a Western missionary, a Chinese pastor, and a preacher of the Methodist Church warmly welcomed us and allowed us to move into their meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their attitude toward us was very open, and they invited us to preach a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There were many who had a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I came to Yi-Yang by car a few days ago and waited for two days in Yi-Yang for a bus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I received Brother Sun Bao-chai's letter and learned that this road was difficult and with bandits, so it was not the right time to go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I could not go by water either, because the water level was too low.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We decided to stay in Ch'ang-Teh temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Dr. Qu went to Yuan-Jiang yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is hard to say whether he will hire a local boat or take the steamer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Feng is doing his best to help us and has already found three places to stay one in Brother Chu Teh-hsin's home, one in Mr. Chao's home the responsible one in the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church , and one in Brother Feng's home.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The area around Ch'ang-Teh is still peaceful, and the cost of living is very low.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One measure of the best rice is six dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If Ch'ang-sha is not affected by the crisis, we can stay here for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the situation becomes tense, we are prepared to retreat to Chen-Jou.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Loh Yung-dien, who used to teach in Sui-Jou Secondary School in Jia-Shing, has escaped here to Ch'ang-Teh with seven poor, homeless students.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Lo married Miss Ma Ru-xun on the twenty-seventh of last month.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the seven students started out, there were a few who were not saved, but while they were fleeing, they all saw their sins and repented, believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They also received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Presently, we need a place to preach the gospel in Ch'ang-Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord open for us a door for the gospel here.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We ask you brothers to be our backup in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Peace and well-being in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your brother,</S>
