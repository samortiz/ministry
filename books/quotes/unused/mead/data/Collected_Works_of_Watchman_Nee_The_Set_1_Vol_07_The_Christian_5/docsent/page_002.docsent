   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STORIES Issue No. 5 THE WAY TO SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A man was deeply touched by the Holy Spirit, and he desired to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, he did not know the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He asked one of his friends, "What should I do to be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His friend was busy with his own work and answered him hastily, "Start with the first all' in Isaiah 53:6 and end with the last all,' and you will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Indeed, when this person received with faith the fact of these two "alls," he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Are you saved?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Please try the same method.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOD ANSWERING PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There was a child who was called Henry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was young, but he knew about God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He told his family that whenever one asks of God, God will answer him; He will never leave anything unanswered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The grown-ups in the family did not believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They thought that God sometimes answers and sometimes does not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once it was raining, and everyone told Henry, "If God hears your prayer, why don't you pray that it will not rain tomorrow?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Henry said, "Very good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I will pray."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The next day it was still raining heavily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The others asked Henry, "Did God answer your prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>See how heavy the rain is!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Henry answered, "God has indeed answered my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He answered by saying, No.'"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A spiritual missionary once told me an experience of hers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She said that she was once in a certain denomination, and she was sent to work as a teacher in a parochial school.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of her love for the Lord, she did much work among the students.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She brought the unbelievers to salvation and perfected the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord greatly blessed her work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of this, her co-workers became jealous of her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, a person from her denomination accused her of many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The annual board committee would not announce the name of the accuser, nor would they tell her what charge was brought against her.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They only sent a few persons to tell her that the denomination would no longer hire her and that she should pack up her belongings and go back to England.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She was expelled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When she heard this, it was like an unexpected thunder from the sky; she did not know where the storm came from.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She told the committee that she was willing to return home, but that they should tell her who was accusing her and what was the mistake she had made that forced her to return home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if she were a criminal, she could not be sentenced to the guillotine without a trial.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the committee was adamant in not telling her the name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, she committed the matter to God in her prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the blow was so great, she wept and cried before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She knew that she had not made any mistake that could cause her expulsion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She considered how her name and character would be slandered from that time on, and she decided that she would not give up unless the committee would tell her the truth and give her the chance to defend herself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more she considered her future, the more her pride would not let her give in.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, in her prayer, it seemed that she saw the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord taught her, "You belong to Me. Those who accused you also belong to Me. I am the Head, and both of you are My members.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consider My hands.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What difference does it make to My head if it is the thumb or the middle finger that is hurt?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To my head both cause pain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether you are hurt or the other is hurt, it is a fact that I have been hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why do you have to argue?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why do you have to justify yourself and put shame on others?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You may be able to save yourself from false accusations, but is not the hurt done to Me the same?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why justify yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My child, be at peace!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Your future is in My hands!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After this, she returned to her country, and she suffered much misunderstanding and despising.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Others thought that she had committed untold crimes!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today, she has been back at work in Fukien for over twenty years, but none of her former co-workers are left in China any longer!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Issue No. 9 ENVIRONMENT</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A Bible salesman went to the villages to preach the gospel and to sell Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He told others that the Holy Book is powerful to change men's behavior and to deliver them from judgment of sins and to keep them from sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One opposer stepped forward and asked, "How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Who can be without sin in a sin-infested world?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Can a man be free from the influence of his environment?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What can you show me that is not affected by its environment?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Bible salesman said, "The fish swims in the salty sea, but it does not turn into a salty fish!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is so threatening about the environment?"</S>
