   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE FORMS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are three major problems that needed to be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How could our sins be taken away?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How could Satan be destroyed?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How could God's life be ours?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first twelve chapters of John these problems are fully resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is portrayed in three different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These three pictures are of three different aspects of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 1:29 Christ is "the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ died first as the redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the cross He died for our sins and redeemed us by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His death has taken away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Brass Serpent</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 3:14 the Lord, referring to Himself, tells us that "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the eyes of God, when Christ was lifted up on the cross, He was in the form of a brass serpent, that is, in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why was He in this form?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was "that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil" Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the death of the cross He judged Satan and destroyed him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christians appreciate Christ's dying for us as the Lamb of God, but few have ever heard that He died also in the form of a brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The story of the brass serpent is recounted in Numbers 21:5-9.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Two kinds of serpents are described.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first kind was the fiery serpents that bit and poisoned the children of Israel as a punishment for their complaining.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The second kind was the serpent of brass which Moses made at the Lord's command and put upon a pole; anyone who was bitten and looked at this serpent was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ was like that serpent of brass.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was lifted up on the cross so that "every one who believes in Him may have eternal life" John 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the Devil was judged and destroyed by Christ's death, we may have eternal life by believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Grain of Wheat</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 12:24 the Lord likened Himself to a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ died in the form of a grain of wheat in order to release the divine life and impart it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Originally life is only in the single grain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But through death the life in this grain is released and imparted into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are those grains of wheat!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CHRIST AVAILABLE TO US</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you seen these three aspects of the death of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is because of all three that we are able to receive of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were sinners, under the dark power of Satan and without the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through His death as the Lamb, Christ bore away our sins; as the brass serpent, He destroyed Satan; as the grain of wheat, He imparted the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our sins are gone!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Devil is destroyed!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's life in Christ is available to us!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no longer any hindrance for us to receive all things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have boldness through the blood of Christ to enter the Holy of Holies to receive mercy and grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever you need of Christ you may receive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Right now if you need refreshing, you can turn to Him and declare, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My sins have been taken away, the Devil has been destroyed, and life has been imparted into me!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will be refreshed by Him!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you ask me what my need is, I will reply that my need right now is for utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While I am speaking, I am looking to the Lord for power, for impact, for utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I need a fresh, instant utterance to gain you for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As I speak, I am praying, "Lord, gain Scandinavia!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Gain Sweden!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Norway!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Denmark!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Finland!"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am hungry for this!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I need the Lord to satisfy my hunger!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You too can have your hunger and thirst satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To be hungry for Him indicates that you are pursuing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How is it that you can pursue Him?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is because on the cross He took away your sins and destroyed Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Devil is under your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sins and Satan are on the negative side; on the positive side, the divine life has been imparted into you, making you a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>GRAINS FOR A LOAF</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>John 1:12-13 reveals that we are God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How is it that we human beings can be children of God?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is because God's life has come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This came about because a grain of wheat fell into the ground and died.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The life in that grain has been released into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are those many grains, God's children possessing His life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What are the grains of wheat used for?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They are to make a loaf of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We who are many are one bread, one Body 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The many sons of God are the members of Christ for Him to have a living Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>REPAIRING THE DAMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What we have covered in this message is part of John's mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even in our time this matter of the many grains possessing the divine life that Christ may have a Body is almost entirely overlooked by the vast majority of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This item was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>John stepped in to repair the damage.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The other Gospels do not cover this.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is John who tells us that our Christ was God; that He became a man to bring us reality and grace; that for us to receive Him He died on the cross as the Lamb of God to take away our sins; as the brass serpent to destroy the Devil; and as the grain of wheat to release the divine life into many grains, children of God for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the first main point of John's mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Paul's ministry had completed the word of God a quarter of a century earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the years after that, many damaging teachings found their way into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Because of this damage, John wrote his Gospel, his Epistles, and the Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>These writings were to repair the torn fabric of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>How much we owe to his mending ministry!</S>
