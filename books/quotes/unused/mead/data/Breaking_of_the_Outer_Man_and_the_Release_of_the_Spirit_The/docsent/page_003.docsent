   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEATH AND THE BEARING OF FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Life is in the grain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, there is a shell outside of the grain, a very powerful shell.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as this shell does not break open, the grain cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is this death?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the action of the temperature and moisture of the earth upon the grain which results in the breaking of the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the shell breaks, the grain grows.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, it is not a matter of whether or not the grain has life, but whether the outer shell is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The very next verse says, "He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life" v. 25 . According to the Lord the outer shell is our own life, and the inner life is the eternal life that He dispenses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order for the inner life to be released, the outer life must suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If that which is outward is not broken, that which is inward cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among all the people in the world, some have the Lord's life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among those who have the Lord's life, we find two different kinds of conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With the first, the life is bound, surrounded, and locked up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the second, the Lord has opened up a way and the life can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The problem with us today is not how we can have life, but how we can allow this life to flow out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we say that the Lord has to break us, this is not a figure of speech or a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our very being has to be broken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord's life is well able to spread over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, it is locked up within us!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord is well able to bless the church, yet His life is imprisoned, contained, and blocked in us!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the outer man is not broken, we can never become a blessing to the church, nor can we expect the world to receive God's grace through us!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE NEED FOR THE BREAKING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>OF THE ALABASTER FLASK</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible speaks of ointment of pure nard John 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's Word purposely uses the adjective pure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is ointment of pure nard, something truly spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unless the alabaster flask is broken, however, the ointment of pure nard cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is strange that many people appreciate the alabaster flask.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They think that the flask is more precious than the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many people think that their outer man is more precious than their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the problem facing the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may treasure our own wisdom and think that we are quite superior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another person may treasure his emotions and also think that he is quite outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many people treasure themselves; they think that they are much better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They think their eloquence, their ability, their discernment, and their judgment are better.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we are not antique collectors; we are not admirers of alabaster flasks.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are those who are after the aroma of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the outer part is not broken, the inner part will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We will have no way to go on, and the church will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We no longer should be so protective of ourselves.</S>
