[1]  Lesson 41: The Believers Experience of the Dispensing of the Processed Triune God in Other Aspects 1
[2]  In their spirit in the gospel of God s Son.
[3]  We have seen in volume 4 of Level 3 that in the progressing stage of God s full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church, and by living in the Body of Christ.
[4]  We need to experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in other aspects, including serving and worshipping God, working and laboring for the Lord, not loving the world, overcoming Satan, fighting the good fight, running the course of the race, being profited by all things in our circumstances and environment, having the best attitude toward others, having the highest standard of morality and virtues, and watching and praying.
[5]  Furthermore, the fact that we are serving a living God proves that we are in God the Father v. 1 . If we were not in the Father, we would not be able to serve a living God.
[6]  When they come to serve and worship God, they need to have a pure conscience, a conscience purified from dead works or from any kind of offense.
[7]  To worship in dead religion, in our mind, or to serve any dead thing rather than God does not require our conscience to be purified.
[8]  Thus, our defiled conscience needs to be purified by the blood of Christ so that we may depart from dead works to serve and worship the living God in a living way.
[9]  In the eyes of God we were dead Eph 2:1; Col 2:13 ; thus, whatever we did, bad or good, was dead works in the sight of the living God Heb 9:14 .
[10]  He says that the genuine people of God must be in spirit and that true circumcision is in the spirit 2:29 , that we should serve God in newness of spirit 7:6 , and that we must be burning in spirit, serving the Lord 12:11 .
[11]  The believers serve God not only in their spirit; they serve Him also by the Spirit of God Phil 3:3 .
[12]  All the New Testament believers are priests to God 1 Pet 2:9; Rev 1:6 .
[13]  Whenever we get into our spirit, we also get into the Spirit of God.
[14]  Likewise, when we worship God by the Spirit of God, we also worship Him in our spirit.
[15]  Whereas the Judaizers serve by ordinances of the law related to the flesh, we as New Testament believers serve and worship God in our spirit by the Spirit of God.
[16]  Paul worked and labored for the Lord by His resurrection life and power, as indicated in verse 10: By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
[17]  After the Lord s resurrection, the apostles did not cease preaching the gospel of Jesus as the Christ Acts 5:42 .
[18]  They went throughout the land preaching God s word as the gospel, that is, proclaiming the Lord Himself as the gospel 8:4-5 .
[19]  As the believers work and labor for the Lord, they preach Christ as the gospel to sinners by preaching the word of God.
[20]  A minister of Christ does not mainly denote a minister who belongs to Christ, preaches Christ, teaches Christ, or tells others about Christ; instead, it denotes a person who ministers Christ to others, that is, serves others with Christ, ministering Christ as Savior, life, life supply, and every positive thing.
[21]  F. Shepherding the Saints as the Flock of God
[22]  Peter also said, Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God v. 2 . To shepherd according to God means to shepherd according to God s nature, desire, way, and glory, not according to man s preference, interest, and purpose.
[23]  in the Day of the Resurrection of the Righteous
[24]  The believers who work and labor for the Lord will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous Luke 14:14; John 5:29; Rev 20:4-6; 11:18; 1 Cor 4:5 .
[25]  IN OTHER ASPECTS 3 OUTLINE Not loving the world the evil satanic system: Keeping the love of God in them.
[26]  If we keep the love of God with which He has loved us, we will not love the world; that is, we will not love anything in place of God.
[27]  Because God is so great, we cannot contact all that He is.
[28]  Whenever we contact God, we contact only the portion emanating from Him, which we call the will of God.
[29]  Just as the world is against God the Father, so the things in the world, which are its lust, are against the will of God.
[30]  C. Because of Their Not Loving Their Soul-life Even unto Death
[31]  Third, those who overcome the devil do not love their soul-life even unto death.
[32]  As a result of Adam s fall, Satan joined himself to man s soul-life, man s self Matt 16:23-24 .
[33]  Hence, to overcome Satan we should not love our soul-life; rather, we should hate and deny it Luke 14:26; 9:23 .
[34]  Jude 3 says that we should contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.
[35]  In this verse, as in 1 Timothy 6:12 and 2 Timothy 4:7, the faith refers not to our subjective believing but to our objective belief, that is, to what we believe.
[36]  The prize that the believers win for running the race is an incorruptible crown 1 Cor 9:25 , which is a reward as an incentive.
[37]  This reward will be given to us according to our works at the Lord s coming back Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12; 1 Cor 4:5 .
[38]  Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens as the Son of God 1:5 and the Son of Man 2:6 , that is, in the person of God 1:8 and of man 2:6 , as the appointed Heir of all things 1:2 , the anointed One of God v. 9 , the Author of our salvation 2:10 , the Sanctifier v. 11 , the constant Succor v. 16 , the instant Helper 4:16 , the Apostle from God 3:1 , the High Priest 2:17; 4:14; 7:26 , the Minister of the true tabernacle 8:2 with a more excellent ministry v. 6 , the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant 7:22; 8:6; 12:24 , the Executor of the new testament 9:16-17 , the Forerunner 6:20 , the Author and Perfecter of faith 12:2 , and the great Shepherd of the sheep 13:20 . If we look unto Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He will transfuse and infuse us with all that He is by ministering heaven, life, and strength to us, to enable us to run the heavenly race and to live the heavenly life on earth.
[39]  To fight the good fight of the faith is to fight for the contents of the complete gospel according to God s New Testament economy and to fight against the different teachings of the dissenters, so as to accomplish God s economy according to the apostle s ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life for the glory of the blessed God.
[40]  IN OTHER ASPECTS 5 OUTLINE Being profited by all things in their circumstances and environments: All things working together for good to those who love God.
[41]  In the progressing stage of God s full salvation, the stage of transformation, by the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, that is, by the infusing and transfusing of the riches of the processed Triune God, the believers serve and worship God, work and labor for the Lord, do not love the world, overcome Satan the devil, fight the good fight, and run the course of the race.
[42]  God s purpose is His plan, and His plan is that we be conformed to the image of His Son so that He would be the Firstborn among many brothers v. 29 . God has put us into Christ, who is the prototype, the model, the mold, and the pattern, so that we may be molded into the image of God s firstborn Son.
[43]  Being Able to Separate Them from the Love of God
[44]  Once God loves us, He loves us forever with an eternal love.
[45]  Nothing can separate us from the love of God.
[46]  Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?...For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord vv.
[47]  Paul wrote in Christ Jesus our Lord because he knew that there would be a problem if the love of God was separated from Christ Jesus.
[48]  To suffer afflictions is our destiny because this is God s ordination.
[49]  If we are established in the faith, afflictions will do good for us according to God s purpose in His appointment.
[50]  According to God s design and arrangement, all these persons, matters, and things are used by God to work together for good to those who love Him, that is, to those who have been called by Him so that He may fulfill His purpose, which is to conform us to the image of His Son that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers.
[51]  By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, the believers can accept with joy the plundering of their possessions, knowing that they have a better possession and an abiding one Heb 10:34 .
[52]  U. Not Being Ashamed of Suffering as a Christian
[53]  This means that if we suffer from persecutors who contemptuously call us a Christian, we should not feel ashamed, but rather, we should glorify God in this name.
[54]  If we suffer for being such a person, we should not feel ashamed, because when we suffer in the name of Christ and as Christians, the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of glory, rests upon us.
[55]  By the experience of the divine dispensing, we will reign in the coming age with Christ through endurance in this age.
[56]  In 2 Timothy 2:12 Paul says, If we endure, we will also reign with Him.
[57]  IN OTHER ASPECTS 7 OUTLINE Having the best attitude toward others: Being subject to the government: Recognizing that the authorities are from God, appointed by God, as servants of God.
[58]  In being subject to the government, believers should pay taxes and customs to the authorities as God s officers vv.
[59]  On the one hand, we are in a good condition, enjoying a good country with a good government; on the other hand, we need to pay for this by paying taxes and customs to the authorities as God s officers.
[60]  Therefore, in order to love our enemies, we must be born of God to be a God-man, a person saturated with God and mingled with Him.
[61]  IN OTHER ASPECTS 8 OUTLINE Having the highest standard of morality and virtues: Having been created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that they would walk in them.
[62]  In God s eyes the church, the masterpiece of God s work, is the highest poetry Eph 2:10 , expressing God s infinite wisdom and divine design.
[63]  As God s masterpiece, we have been created for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them v. 10 . However, the good works for which God created us are not the good things according to our general natural concept but the definite good things that God preplanned and ordained for us to walk in. These good things include doing His will, living the church life, and bearing the testimony of Jesus.
[64]  In Titus 2:14 Paul says that Christ gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession, zealous of good works.
[65]  This means that Christ gave Himself not only that He might redeem us from all lawlessness 1 Cor 6:20; 1 Pet 1:18-19; 1 Tim 2:6 but also that He might purify to Himself a particular people Deut 7:6; 14:2; 26:18 as His unique possession and personal treasure 1 Pet 2:9; Exo 19:5 .
[66]  We, the believers in Christ, have been created in Christ for good works and redeemed by Christ to be His people, zealous of good works.
[67]  In Matthew 5:20 the Lord Jesus said, Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[68]  This righteousness refers not only to the redeeming Christ, who becomes our objective righteousness when we believe in Him and receive Him so that we were justified before God 1 Cor 1:30; Rom 3:26 , but much more to the indwelling Christ, who lives out of us as our subjective righteousness so that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future.
[69]  The old law regarding swearing was that we should not break an oath.
[70]  We are not to swear by heaven, by the earth, unto Jerusalem, or by our head, because heaven, the earth, Jerusalem, and our head are not under our control but under God s control.
[71]  Second Thessalonians 2:16 and 17 say, Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope in grace, comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.
[72]  From Level 2, volume 3 of Truth Lessons up to this lesson, we have gradually and carefully looked into the believers experience in the progressing stage of God s full salvation, the stage of transformation.
[73]  This stage includes five major items: 1 experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His Triune dispensing; 2 experiencing God s redemption continually; 3 enjoying the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation; 4 experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church, and by living in the Body of Christ; and 5 experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in other aspects.
[74]  In this stage of transformation we are saved from the power of sin, the law of sin and of death, our old man, our flesh with its lusts, our self, our soul natural life , our individualism, Satan, the world with its present age and its religious aspect, the law of letters with its ordinances, and the degradation of the church with all its mixtures.
[75]  LESSON FIFTY THE ISSUE OF THE BELIEVERS EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT
[76]  OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING OUTLINE Becoming, as the bride, one with the Spirit: The Spirit, as the consummation of the processed and dispensed Triune God, becoming one with the bride the aggregate of all the regenerated and transformed tripartite men.
[77]  Forming a universal couple the mingling of the processed Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man.
[78]  Calling the thirsty ones to come and drink the water of life the flow of the processed and dispensing Triune God: Participating in God s central goal.
[79]  According to the entire Bible, there is a divine romance between God the Creator, the Redeemer, who is the male, and His redeemed people, who are the female.
[80]  Anyone who answers the call to come and drink of the water of life will participate in the central goal of God s economy.
[81]  This means that he will share in the dispensing of the processed Triune God and be a part of the bride of the Lamb for the satisfaction and expression of the processed and dispensing Triune God.
[82]  In the progressing stage of God s full salvation, the believers experience and enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God will also issue in their looking to and waiting for the Lord Jesus coming back to usher them into their future.
[83]  According to 1 Thessalonians 1:9 and 10, we have turned to God from idols not only to serve a living and true God but also to await His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.
[84]  While experiencing the stage of transformation in God s full salvation by the dispensing of the processed Triune God and after reading various portions of the Scriptures regarding the Lord s coming, we should, like John, express the desire from our deepest part as a prayer to hasten the Lord s coming.
