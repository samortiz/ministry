   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE SIN OFFERING CHRIST FOR THE SIN OF GOD'S PEOPLE 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 4:1-7, 13-18, 22-25, 27-30, 32-34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will cover a number of matters related to the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIN OFFERING A. For the Sin of Ignorance</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A number of times Leviticus 4 speaks of the sin of ignorance vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1-2, 13, 22, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A sin of ignorance refers to a mistake, error, or oversight; that is, it denotes sinning unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we may not have the intention to sin, we nevertheless sin unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sin of ignorance in Leviticus 4 signifies the sin in our fallen nature, the indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sin which we inherited from Adam dwells in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times we sin unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These sins come from the indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sin came in through Adam's fall and entered into the human race Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, with all human beings there is something called sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Romans 7 sin is personified, because it can dwell in us v. 17 , kill us v. 11 , and do many things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, sin is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot find a verse which says that sin is Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the Bible indicates that sin is the nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since sin is the nature of Satan, sin is actually Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sin entered the human race at the time of Adam's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that Adam's fall opened the gate for sin, which is the nature of Satan and even Satan himself, to come into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 7 tells us clearly that sin dwells in our flesh vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>17, 20, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have often wanted to do good, for example to honor our parents or regard our brother, yet the outcome was just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We sinned unintentionally, doing something that we had no intention of doing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because Paul had this kind of experience, he could say, "It is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me" Rom 7:20b .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Romans 7 we can see two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One person does not want to sin, and the other person, who is within the first person, sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that Paul was living a life of two persons a life of himself, Saul of Tarsus, and a life of something that is called sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These two persons lived together, but not willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes they were good friends, and sometimes they fought with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 7 is a picture of our experience not only before we were saved but even today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Have you not discovered that there is a war going on within you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, we may say, "I love the church."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, something within us says, "I do not like the church."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes we may say, "I love all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of them are dear and lovable."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, there may be a certain elder whom we cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a fighting within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We aspire to be holy, but the outcome is not holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All day long we commit sins of ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may have been Christians for years, but there is still a war going on within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may want to be perfect, but we do many things that are sins of ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, since sin dwells within us and we commit sins of ignorance, we are not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anything that is done out of our flesh is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the eyes of God, even our love that is out of the flesh is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only the bad things are sin, but even the good things that are out of the flesh are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the source, not the outcome or issue, that counts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the reason Galatians 5:24 says, "They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the human view, the flesh may seem to be good as well as bad.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But whether we are good, bad, or in the middle, as long as we are flesh we are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The flesh is altogether one with sin Rom 8:3 , and sin is altogether one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually, sin is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, Satan is one with the world, and the world is one with the prince of the world John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These five things are one matter: the flesh, sin, Satan, the world, and the prince the authority or power of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today's world is related to the flesh, sin, Satan, and the prince of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The word prince here implies authority or power.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The world is actually the struggle for power.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every person and every nation are struggling for power.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everywhere there is competition, rivalry, for power.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the universities both the professors and the students are struggling for power.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, a professor may say that he is trying to help society or that he wants to invent something to benefit society.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Actually he, along with everyone else, is struggling for power.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This struggle for power is the result, the issue, of the flesh, sin, Satan, the world, and the prince of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Galatians 5:16-26 speaks of the struggle between the flesh and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 26, the concluding verse of this section, says, "Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this verse is the struggle for vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This indicates that even in the church life there may be the struggle for vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is proved by the fact that Paul's word here was written to churches, to the churches of Galatia Gal 1:2 , which was a province of the ancient Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all seek vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If this were not our situation, Paul would not have needed to say this word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may think that the things mentioned in 5:16-26 existed among the churches of Galatia but are not among us today.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, we should not read these verses as applying to them alone; we should include ourselves when we read such verses.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Just as we apply John 3:16 to ourselves, so we should also apply Galatians 5:16-26.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The sin offering has a broad denotation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It deals not only with sin itself but also with our flesh, with Satan, the evil one in our flesh, with the world, and with the struggle for power.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>According to the Bible, sin is involved with these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Satan is the prince of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Satan may even be proud of being such a prince.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Isaiah 14 reveals that although he was close to God, he was not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He wanted to be above God or at least to be in rivalry with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, when the Bible condemns sin, it condemns Satan and also the flesh, the world, and the struggle for power.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Everything that is happening on earth is related to the struggle for power.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All the good speeches, lectures, and explanations given by men are just cloaks to cover the struggle for power.</S>
