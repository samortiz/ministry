<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT BEING<br>THE AGGREGATE OF THE ALL-EMBRACING BLESSING<br>OF THE FULL GOSPEL OF GOD IN CHRIST<br>FOR THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br>ACCORDING TO THE DIVINE ECONOMY</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit, whom the all-inclusive Christ (as the threefold seed in humanity) has become, is the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ (Gal. 3:14) for the divine dispensing according to the divine economy. This all-embracing blessing comprises many items. To know these items is to have a "master key" to open every book of the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Processed and Resurrected Christ<br>Coming Back to His Disciples and Breathing<br>Himself as Such a Life-giving Spirit<br>into His Disciples</H2><P>On the day of His resurrection, the processed and resurrected Christ, who has become the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God, came back to His disciples and breathed Himself as such a life-giving Spirit into His disciples for them to receive as the Holy Spirit to be their life, their person, and their everything (John 20:22). Some who hold a tritheistic concept of the Trinity have opposed us for saying that Christ is the Spirit. However, there is a clear word in the Bible that says that the very Christ who is our Redeemer and Savior is now the Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit," and 2 Corinthians 3:17a says, "And the Lord is the Spirit," which Spirit is "the Lord Spirit" who transforms us (v. 18). Brother Nee received this light concerning the Spirit almost fifty years ago, and the light we have received in recent years is even stronger and more profound. Today we have the boldness to say that the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</P><P>To repeat, on the day of His resurrection, the processed and resurrected Christ, who has become the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God, came back to His disciples and breathed Himself as such a life-giving Spirit into them. John 20:22 says, "And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit." In the Old Testament the title the Holy Spirit was not used; this title was not used until the beginning of the New Testament, when God was incarnated (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35). The title the Holy Spirit definitely denotes a person. The use of this title in John 20:22 makes the breathing in that verse different from the breathing in Genesis 2:7. The breathing in Genesis 2:7 was the breathing of a breath, not of a person. But the breathing in John 20:22 is called the Holy Spirit. Surely this denotes not merely a breath but a person, the breather Himself. The Holy Spirit whom we are to receive is the Triune God reaching us. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow and also the reaching of the Triune God. The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God; thus, when we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive the totality of the Triune God.</P>
