   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Organizational but Organic</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the saints in a group meeting sit silently, we should learn to be patient and not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even if it is difficult to endure the silence, we should never start anything; we should simply be in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1937 I was invited to speak concerning the book of Hebrews at a training for preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time, they also invited me to join their meetings in various places.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One time I asked, When does your morning meeting begin?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They said, We ask the saints to meet in the morning, but we do not say what time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All of our believers tend to trickle in one by one from nearby villages.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We wait until they all arrive, and then we sound a bell and begin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Afterward I went to join one of their morning meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was one-thirty in the afternoon by the time everyone sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I asked, Why do these Western missionaries not teach people to keep the time?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I learned that these Western missionaries did not want to touch the matter of meeting on time because this would inhibit the believers from wanting to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this matter I learned a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are being trained to be on time, but when we go out to serve, we should always remember that the brothers and sisters have not been trained.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be in a hurry and want to begin a meeting on time, but they are used to arriving late.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a test to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we fail the test, the group meeting will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may ask how can there be a meeting if everyone is late.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps after six months, we can encourage the saints not to be late.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should wait until we are able to render this type of help.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the saints know us, they will appreciate the help.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we must not do anything in the way of organization; we must be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>RECEIVING A FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We thank the Lord and rejoice to see that the majority of the full-time trainees are under thirty-five years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we must learn earnestly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This one or two years of training is a foundation for the trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It will be a great help when they serve the Lord in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praying Daily for Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1932 I had been saved for seven years, and I was used by the Lord to establish a small church in my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later the Lord compelled me to give up my job and serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, the Lord brought me to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time I learned from Solomon to pray, Lord, give me wisdom, that I may know how to go out and come in before Your people cf.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 Chron 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I prayed in this way for several years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As I look back, I feel that the Lord has heard my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The trainees should also pray, Lord, I am still young and only beginning to learn to serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Give me wisdom so that I may know how to go out and come in before Your people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Studying Seriously the Three T Books</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul says, If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How to conduct oneself in the house of God means how to behave and act in God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The three books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus clearly state how a serving one should conduct himself and how he should cultivate his character.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The trainees need to study these books diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are several terms in these books that are worthy of attention: turning away 1 Tim 6:20 , avoid 2 Tim 2:16; Titus 3:9 , and flee 1 Tim 6:11; 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should study what things to turn away from, what things to avoid, and what things to flee from.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In addition, we should depart from unrighteousness v. 19 , refuse a factious man Titus 3:10 , and refuse profane and old-womanish myths 1 Tim 4:7 . We should find and study such terms in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we will know which things to turn away from, which things to avoid, which things to depart from, and which things to refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we flee, we must do it quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we avoid something, we must stay a good distance from it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we turn away, we must behave as if we were facing an oncoming car.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do not turn away, we will be in a car accident.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All of us should have the thoughts of fleeing, avoiding, and turning away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These books also speak of the conscience: a pure conscience 3:9; 2 Tim 1:3 and a good conscience 1 Tim 1:5, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They speak of holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience 3:9 , which mystery is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We see from the Scriptures that the mystery of God is Christ Col 2:2 , and the mystery of Christ is the church Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to have a pure conscience to hold the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our conscience is an indication of whether we are holding the mystery of the faith; hence, we need to conduct ourselves in order to have a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some people thrust their faith and conscience away and become shipwrecked regarding the faith 1 Tim 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All these are related to cultivating our character.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must study these books diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, we should not merely learn the truth and grow in life; we must also learn how to serve and how to be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Such matters cannot be learned in one or two days.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it requires one or two years to learn how to play basketball, it is even more necessary to practice in the matter of serving the Lord.</S>
