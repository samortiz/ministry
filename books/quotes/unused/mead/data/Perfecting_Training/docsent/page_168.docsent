   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GENUINE AND PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must be those all the time living our life in one way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether we are at home, in the church matters, or in the meeting, we live our life one way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most of the brothers don t apply Romans 8 to the way they talk to their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I don t mean that the husbands are mean or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They may be very gentle and very nice, but their gentleness is not according to their application of Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you don t apply Romans 8 when you talk to your wife, the Perfecting Training has been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It has been mainly helping you to be more religious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 8 is altogether a chapter on the genuine and proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is an extraordinary chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Its style, its composition, and the way of its presentation is altogether extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more you get into it the more you would appreciate it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 8 is not a chapter full of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is just a mentioning of a life, or of a living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It shows the genuine living of a collective people who have the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to be such an all-inclusive, life-dispensing Spirit, dispensing Himself all the day long into their tripartite being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to saturate their spirit, their soul, and their body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to transform them and to build them all together into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This chapter describes such a people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As such a people, they just live.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>LIVING AS SONS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the human beings are genuine descendants of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether we are American, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Indonesian, French, or English, we are genuine descendants of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are born of him, and spontaneously we all live a life of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when you come to Romans 8, after the first thirteen verses, it says, As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words they are descendants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No human beings have to perform to live a life of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their politeness and other things are a performance, but their genuine daily living is not a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That is a living of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have a new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have a new life and a new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even we have been made a new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So on the one hand we are descendants of Adam, the sons of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The problem is here: Do we live as the sons of God or as the descendants of Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 8 is not a kind of teaching or exhortation or charge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is just a depiction of the living of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These sons of God are still a tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They have a spirit, they have a mind representing the soul, and they have a body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Also in this depiction, it shows us how God has been processed, and after this process, He as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is now the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit to saturate our entire being with what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is indwelling us to infuse us with all of His being so that we may become His sons to live as He lives, to have a living, not as the descendants of Adam, but as the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As such we are led all the day by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a living not just in the meeting and not just in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not a living just in the time of pray-reading or in the time of studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a living all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We just live this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE LAW OF LIFE BEING A PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to consider once again the eleven positive items in Romans 8:1-14.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first item is the law v. 2 . This law is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have pointed out in other messages that the law of the Spirit of life is just the Triune God working, operating, moving, and anointing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So the first item of the positive things is a Person working within us as a law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most Christians have never realized that the law of the Spirit of life is the Triune God, a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Too many times when Christians talk about the Spirit, they don t consider a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This Person who is the Spirit is not only the Spirit, but He is also the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The second item is the Spirit, and the third is life v. 2 . This Person who is working within us as the law is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is also the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is the law, the Spirit, and He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the three are one Person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit denotes mainly the Person, the life, this Person s life, and the law, the function of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Animal life is a law; plant life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The peach life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No one teaches the peach tree to bring forth peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The peach life is a law regulating the peach tree to produce peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every animal has a life, and that life is its law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even our human life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>So actually, the law, the Spirit, and the life all refer to the same Person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This same Person is the law, He is the Spirit, and He also is the life.</S>
