<h1 class="title">An Epistle to River Crossers</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 14:13; Exo. 3:18; 9:1, 13;<br />
Heb. 1:1-2a; 11:8-16; 6:19; 13:13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Epistle to the Hebrews is an epistle to river crossers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The root of the word <em>Hebrew</em> means &ldquo;to pass over&rdquo;&mdash;Gen. 14:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Specifically, it can mean &ldquo;to pass over a river,&rdquo; that is, to pass over from one side of the river to another.</li>
		<li>A Hebrew is one who crosses a river, a person from the other side of the river.</li>
		<li>River crossers are a people separated from the world.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Abraham was the first Hebrew, the first river crosser&mdash;Gen. 14:13; Heb. 11:8-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Abraham left Chaldea, crossed the flood, and came into Canaan, the good land of blessing&mdash;Josh. 24:2-3.</li>
		<li>Abraham&rsquo;s crossing the river and entering into the new land signified his entering into an uplifted, new mankind, which would be used by God to be His expression.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our God is the God of the Hebrews&mdash;Exo. 3:18; 9:1, 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He is the God of the river crossers, the God of the separated people.</li>
		<li>The God of the Hebrews is the God of the people who have crossed the river for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The God of the Hebrews has written the book of Hebrews to us&mdash;Heb. 1:1-2a; 12:25a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The basic concept of the book of Hebrews is that of crossing the river, of passing over from one side to another.</li>
		<li>The Epistle to the Hebrews is only for river crossers.</li>
		<li>If we have crossed the river, we can understand this wonderful book&mdash;Heb. 5:12; 6:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The purpose of God&rsquo;s speaking in the Epistle to the Hebrews is that all who contact God by faith would be river crossers&mdash;Heb. 11:1, 6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In suffering death, the Lord Jesus crossed the river and entered into the region of God&rsquo;s expression, the region of God&rsquo;s glory&mdash;Heb. 2:9; 6:19-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The death through which the Lord Jesus passed was a baptism&mdash;Mark 10:38; Luke 12:50.</li>
		<li>As the real Joshua, the Lord Jesus took the lead to cross the Jordan River and enter into glory&mdash;the reality of the expression of the Divine Being&mdash;Luke 24:26; 1 Pet. 1:11.</li>
		<li>As the Captain of our salvation, Christ has gone ahead of us that He might help us pass through the waters of suffering and enter into glory&mdash;Heb. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Baptism has made us river crossers, and now we are true, genuine Hebrews, following the Pioneer, &ldquo;the Forerunner, Jesus,&rdquo; into glory&mdash; Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27; Matt. 28:19; Heb. 6:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To cross the river is to wash ourselves from anything old, anything ruined, and anything that does not match God&rsquo;s glory&mdash;Rev. 15:2-3.</li>
		<li>Every time we desire to enter into the temple we need to cross a standing river&mdash; the laver&mdash;Exo. 30:18; 40:30-32; 1 Kings 7:23, 38.</li>
		<li>The crossing of all the rivers brings us into glory, which is God Himself expressed.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would enter into the New Jerusalem as the full expression of the glorious God (Heb. 11:10, 16; 12:22; Rev. 21:2, 10-11), we need to cross over many rivers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to leave the law and cross over to grace&mdash;Heb. 4:16; 7:18-19; 12:28; 13:9.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the old covenant and cross over to the new covenant&mdash;Heb. 8:6-7, 13.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the ritualistic service of the Old Testament and cross over to the spiritual reality of the New Testament&mdash; Heb. 8:5; 9:9-14.</li>
		<li>We need to leave Judaism and cross over to the church&mdash;Heb. 13:13; 10:25.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the earthly things and cross over to the heavenly things&mdash;Heb. 12:18-24.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the outer court and cross over to the Holiest of all&mdash;Heb. 13:9-10; 10:19-20.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the soul and cross over to the spirit&mdash;Heb. 4:12.</li>
		<li>We need to leave the beginning of truth and life and cross over to the maturity of life in the truth&mdash;Heb. 5:11&mdash;6:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As today&rsquo;s Hebrews, river crossers, we need to see God&rsquo;s economy (1 Tim. 1:4) and experience the dispensational transfer revealed in the book of Acts&mdash;Acts 1:4-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The matter of the change of dispensation&mdash;the divine arrangement in God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash; is a strong point in Acts:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To speak of a dispensational change in Acts means that in Acts we see the need of a great transfer, a great turn.</li>
		<li>This change, this transfer, is from the old dispensation to the new.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to be transferred economically from the Old Testament to the New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Although we are New Testament people, we may still have an Old Testament concept.</li>
		<li>We need a transfer out of the law and into Christ, a transfer from being law-keepers to being Jesus-witnesses.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;In the book of Hebrews Paul presents a clear picture showing us that the Old Testament things are over. What remains now in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is Jesus Christ, the all-inclusive One. Having seen such a view, Paul could not tolerate a mixture of such an all-inclusive Christ with the inferior things of the out-of-date, Old Testament economy&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Acts,</em> p. 518).</li>
