<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. In His Resurrection and Ascension, Becoming<br>both the Lord of All and the Christ of God</H2><P>In His resurrection and ascension, Christ became both the Lord of all and the Christ of God (Acts 2:36; Rev. 11:15). He became the Lord of us, and He became the Christ of God to carry out God's economy. He is the Christ of God, the anointed One of God to carry out God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Being the Firstborn of All Creation<br>and the Firstborn of the Resurrection<br>from among the Dead</H2><P>Christ is the Firstborn of all creation and the Firstborn of the resurrection from the dead (Col. 1:15, 18). God has two creations, the old creation and the new creation. The old creation came into being by God's creating work. Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of the old creation. The second creation, God's new creation, came into being by and in resurrection. According to Colossians 1:18, Christ is the Firstborn of the resurrection from among the dead. Thus, Christ is the Firstborn of both creations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Being the One Who Is Worthy<br>to Open the Seven Seals of God<br>concerning God's Administration in the<br>Whole Universe according to God's Economy</H2><P>Christ is the One who is worthy to open the seven seals of God concerning God's administration in the whole universe according to God's economy (Rev. 5:2-5). He is the only One who is worthy to open the sealed secret of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Being the Head of the Body<br>and Also Being the Body of the Corporate Christ</H2><P>Christ is the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18), and He is also the Body of the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12). This means that He is both the Head and the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Being All the Members of the New Man</H2><P>Thus, Christ is all the members of the new man (Col. 3:10-11). The new man is Christ. Christ is all-inclusive.</P>
