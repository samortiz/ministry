[1]  Life-Study of 1 & 2 Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians
[2]  The two Epistles of Paul to the Thessalonians may be considered the earliest of Paul's writings.
[3]  This Epistle and the second were both addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, composed of all the believers in Christ in that city.
[4]  This indicates that such a local church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is united with the Lord Jesus Christ organically in all He is and has done.
[5]  He does not say, as in Romans 1:1, that he is "a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God"; neither does he say, as in Ephesians 1:1, that he is an "apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God."
[6]  It is very significant that in 1:1 Paul inserts the title Father after God and the title Lord before Jesus Christ.
[7]  Rather, we need to say that God is our Father and that Jesus Christ is our Lord.
[8]  If Jesus Christ is not our Lord, then we have nothing to do with Him in a practical way.
[9]  But when Jesus Christ becomes our Lord, this means that we are in Him, organically united to Him.
[10]  We need to understand the difference between work and labor.
[11]  In this message we have covered two basic points: first, that the church is composed of human beings in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ, those who have the life of God and who are in the organic union with Christ; second, that the church life is the Christian life constructed of the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope in the coming Lord.
[12]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE TWO CHARACTERISTICS OF A HOLY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:4-10
[13]  The more we read the book of 1 Thessalonians, the more we realize that it truly was written to young believers.
[14]  PREACHING IN POWER, IN THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND IN MUCH ASSURANCE
[15]  In verse 5 Paul continues, "Because our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake."
[16]  Their ministering of the gospel was not only by word, but also by a life which displays the power of God, a life in the Holy Spirit and in the assurance of their faith.
[17]  Thus, we need to help new believers by presenting them the word of God in power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, matched by our manner of life.
[18]  In verses 9 and 10 we have the details of such a life: "For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God, and to wait for His Son from the heavens, Whom He raised from among the dead Jesus, Who delivers us from the wrath which is coming."
[19]  In these verses we have three details as the contents of a holy life for the church life: turning to God from idols, serving a living and true God, and waiting for His Son from the heavens.
[20]  In my youth I had the impression that Americans did not have any idols.
[21]  There were many idols in China, but my concept was that the United States was a land free of idols.
[22]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE THREE THE LIVING GOD AND THE WORK OF FAITH Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1-10
[23]  For the most part, Christians understand and interpret the Bible in a natural way.
[24]  In 1:3 Paul says, "Remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labor of love, and endurance of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father."
[25]  In 2:13 Paul says, "But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth."
[26]  Let us now go on to consider what faith is and also what the work of faith is.
[27]  In 3:2 Paul says, "And we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow-worker in the gospel of Christ, to establish and encourage you for the sake of your faith."
[28]  In 3:5 Paul goes on to say, "Because of this, when I also could bear it no longer, I sent to know your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would be in vain."
[29]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE FOUR SOME BASIC MATTERS Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1-10
[30]  In reading or studying any part of the Bible, it is always necessary to find out what was in the spirit of the writer.
[31]  In order to learn what was the burden in Paul's spirit in 1 Thessalonians 1, we need to consider some basic matters in this chapter as indicated by the words Paul uses and by the way this chapter is constructed.
[32]  The Jews certainly did not believe that God has a Son; neither did they believe that both the Son of God and the Spirit of God are on the same rank as God.
[33]  If we read 1 Thessalonians 1 carefully, we shall see that even in such a short chapter there are indications of what the Father has done, of what the Son is doing, and of what the Spirit has done and continues to do.
[34]  In verse 4 Paul speaks concerning selection: "Knowing, brothers beloved by God, your selection."
[35]  When the Thessalonians accepted the word preached by Paul, they accepted the Triune God.
[36]  On the positive side, it was being born of God and also believing into the Son of God.
[37]  If we were not in the Father, we would not be serving a living God, and if we were not in Jesus Christ our Lord, we would not be waiting for Him.
[38]  THE WORD OF THE LORD AND FAITH TOWARD GOD
[39]  I would call your attention to verse 8: "For from you the word of the Lord has sounded out, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we have no need to speak anything."
[40]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE FIVE THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED IN THE WORD TO PRODUCE A HOLY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1-10
[41]  It is accurate and correct to say that the books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians are on the church life.
[42]  Although the expression "the church life" cannot be found in these Epistles, the church is mentioned emphatically at the beginning of each book.
[43]  We have pointed out that the books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians are concerned with the church life.
[44]  Recently, as I was studying 1:1, I realized that to speak of the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ is to utter something very weighty and deep.
[45]  In the foregoing message we saw that the Triune God is revealed in chapter one of 1 Thessalonians.
[46]  In verses 1 and 3 Paul speaks of God the Father; in verse 10, of the Son; and in verses 5 and 6, of the Holy Spirit.
[47]  Now we need to study the content of the word, the gospel, preached by Paul.
[48]  Now that we have considered verse 1 in a rather full way, let us go on to verse 3.
[49]  According to verse 3, the labor of love comes after the work of faith.
[50]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE SEVEN THE CHURCH IN THE TRIUNE GOD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1; 2 Thes 1:1; Matt 28:19; Acts 19:5; Rom 6:3; Gal 3:27; Rev 1:11-12
[51]  Suppose Paul had written in a brief way and had simply said "the church in God and Christ."
[52]  For example, in His prayer to the Father recorded in John 17, the Lord Jesus said, "I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world" v. 6 . The Lord also said to the Father, "And I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known" John 17:26 . It is a matter of great significance to know the Father.
[53]  Both Epistles tell us that the church is composed of human beings, in this case, of Thessalonians.
[54]  Nevertheless, some who were once immoral were saved and regenerated and composed the church in their locality in the Triune God.
[55]  Now we need to consider carefully the difference between God and the Triune God.
[56]  To speak only of God is to regard Him as if He had not been processed.
[57]  Then the Lord Jesus said to them, "But you, who do you say that I am?" v. 15 . As we know, Peter, receiving the revelation from the Father, answered and said to the Lord Jesus, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . Thus, in the New Testament we first have the revelation of the name of the Father and then the revelation of the Son of God.
[58]  We have seen that 1:1 indicates that the church is in the Triune God.
[59]  Paul speaks of the Triune God in 2 Corinthians 13:14: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
[60]  Here we have the threefold blessing of the Triune God, the blessing of love, grace, and fellowship.
[61]  We have seen a little of what it means for the church to be in the Father.
[62]  Now let us go on to consider what it means for the church to be in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[63]  There is an important reason why Paul opened the Epistle of 1 Thessalonians the way he did.
[64]  This holy life, this separated life, is for the church life, because the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[65]  Whatever our status is in regard to earthly citizenship, we all need to realize that our real position is that we are in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[66]  If we see the revelation that the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall spontaneously realize that we should not hold to certain concepts or do certain things, for they are worldly, profane, unholy, not separated unto God.
[67]  However, although we have emphasized the Father, the Lord, and Jesus, we have not explained fully what it means for the church to be in Christ.
[68]  The Christ in whom many of today's Christians believe is a Christ far away in the third heaven.
[69]  But our Christ is not only the resurrected and ascended Christ in heaven; He is also the One who has descended and entered into our spirit.
[70]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that to be in Christ is to be in His death, the death which terminates all negative things: sin, the world, the old creation, the old man, the flesh, the self, and Satan.
[71]  When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He terminated all these negative things.
[72]  But because He is the Lord Jesus Christ, we can be in Him and we are in Him right now.
[73]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that for the church to be in Christ is to be in resurrection life.
[74]  I have also been accused of teaching heresy for saying, according to the Bible, that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.
[75]  We should not regard the life-giving Spirit as a Person separate from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[76]  If we truly are the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall not function in the meeting according to our emotion, but we shall function according to the Spirit.
[77]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE ELEVEN THE CHURCH BECOMING THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1; 2:12; 3:12; 4:7; 5:23-24; 2 Thes 1:3, 5, 10; 2:13-14, 16; Col 3:10-11; Rev 1:11-12 CALLED INTO GOD'S KINGDOM AND GLORY
[78]  First Thessalonians 2:12 says, "That you should walk worthily of God, Who calls you into His own kingdom and glory."
[79]  In the foregoing message we considered what it means to walk worthily of God.
[80]  Let us go on to see what it means in a practical way to be called by God into His kingdom and glory.
[81]  In 3:12 Paul says, "And the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we also to you."
[82]  Even though you are still young, you need to realize that as those who belong to the Lord Jesus, you are part of the church, and the church is in the Triune God.
[83]  FURTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHURCH IN THE TRIUNE GOD
[84]  In 2 Thessalonians 1:3 Paul says, "We ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers, even as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all to one another is increasing."
[85]  In this verse Paul speaks of two matters: faith growing and love increasing.
[86]  As we consider the lampstand, therefore, we see the element signifying God the Father, we see the form signifying God the Son, and we see the seven lamps signifying the Spirit of God as the expression.
[87]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE TWELVE THE CARE OF A NURSING MOTHER AND AN EXHORTING FATHER Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:1-12
[88]  In the book of 1 Thessalonians Paul does not speak of miracles.
[89]  Furthermore, with respect to Christian living, he stresses three matters: turning to God from idols, serving the living God, and waiting for the coming back of the Lord Jesus.
[90]  Verse 1 says, "For you yourselves know, brothers, our entrance to you, that it has not been in vain."
[91]  Verse 2 continues, "But having suffered before and having been outrageously treated, even as you know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggle."
[92]  Verse 5 says, "For neither at any time were we found with a word of flattery, even as you know, nor with a pretext for covetousness God is witness."
[93]  In verse 7 Paul says, "But we were gentle in your midst, as a nurse would cherish her own children."
[94]  Now, through the salvation in Christ, they are called and have believed into the kingdom of God, which is the sphere for them to worship and enjoy God under the divine ruling with a view of entering into God's glory.
[95]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE REWARD OF FOSTERING Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:13-20
[96]  Some Christian teachers say that a believer should not give a testimony concerning himself.
[97]  In 2:13 Paul says, "And therefore we also give thanks to God unceasingly that, having received the word of the report from us of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but even as it truly is, the word of God, which also operates in you who believe."
[98]  In verse 14 Paul continues, "For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they also of the Jews."
[99]  In verse 18 Paul says, "Wherefore we wanted to come to you, indeed, I Paul, both once and again, and Satan hindered us."
[100]  Because the apostles were carrying out the will of God, Satan frustrated them.
[101]  This verse tells us clearly that the Christian life has a goal and that this goal is the kingdom of God.
[102]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE FOURTEEN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR FAITH, LOVE, AND HOPE Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 3:1-13 ESTABLISHING AND ENCOURAGING
[103]  In chapter one of 1 Thessalonians we have the structure and origin of a holy life for the church life, and in chapter two we have the fostering of this life.
[104]  We need to consider carefully the meaning of faith in 1 Thessalonians 3.
[105]  In verse 2 faith is not only subjective, referring to the saints' believing, as in verses 5, 6, and 10, but also objective, referring to what they believe in, as in 1 Timothy 3:9; 4:1; and 2 Timothy 4:7.
[106]  When Paul says that Timothy was sent to establish and encourage the believers for the sake of their faith, did he mean objective faith or subjective faith?
[107]  Timothy returned to Paul with good news, telling him that their labor among the Thessalonians was not in vain.
[108]  Paul refers to this report in verse 6: "But Timothy, having just come to us from you, and bringing good news to us of your faith and love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also you."
[109]  Verses 9 and 10 say, "For what thanks can we return to God concerning you, for all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God, night and day beseeching exceedingly that we may see your face and perfect what is lacking in your faith?"
[110]  Beginning in verse 11 he emphasizes love: "Now our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you; and the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we also to you."
[111]  If our faith is perfected and our love grows, increases, and abounds, the result will be a hope of having our hearts established blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of the Lord Jesus with all His saints.
[112]  His way is to show the new believers that they have been regenerated of God the Father and brought into an organic union with the Lord Jesus Christ and thereby have the structure of a holy life.
[113]  The Epistle of 1 Thessalonians was written to new believers, to those who had been in the Lord less than a year.
[114]  According to history, the problem of fornication has come up over and over again in one church after another.
[115]  The facts prove that Christian workers in particular are often snared by fornication because they have so much contact with others.
[116]  God's will is that His redeemed people, the believers in Christ, should live a life of holiness according to His holy nature, a life wholly separated unto Him from anything other than Him.
[117]  In 4:1 Paul says, "For the rest therefore, brothers, we ask and entreat you in the Lord Jesus, that even as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, even as indeed you do walk, that you abound more."
[118]  Fornication always involves overstepping the regulation of the marriage relationship.
[119]  The relationship between male and female was ordained by God.
[120]  Marriage is a holy matter that was ordained by God and is under His strict regulation.
[121]  In 4:11 and 12 Paul speaks concerning a becoming walk: "And to be ambitious to be quiet, and to attend to your own affairs, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you; that you may walk becomingly toward those outside, and you may have need of nothing."
[122]  In verse 11 Paul gives us a good word: "Be ambitious to be quiet."
[123]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE HOPE OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 4:13-18
[124]  In 4:13-18 Paul gives an elementary word concerning the Lord's coming and the rapture of the believers.
[125]  Paul's intention is to give the new believers a basic concept of the hope of our Christian life.
[126]  In verse 13 Paul says, "But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are sleeping, that you may not sorrow even as also the rest who have no hope."
[127]  In verse 14 Paul continues, "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose, so also those who are asleep will God, through Jesus, bring together with Him."
[128]  Verses 15 and 16 will help you to understand what I mean: "For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have slept; because the Lord Himself, with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with a trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first."
[129]  Some among us may still hold the concept that saints who have died have gone to heaven and are now there with the Lord Jesus.
[130]  If Paul had not gone beyond what he says in verse 14, there might be ground for this concept.
[131]  But in verse 16 Paul says that when the Lord Jesus comes, the dead saints will rise up.
[132]  We have pointed out that the Greek word for "coming" in verse 15 is parousia, the same word as used in Matthew 24:3.
[133]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN WATCHFULNESS AND SOBERNESS Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:1-11
[134]  Immediately after Paul presents the hope of a holy life for the church life, he covers the matter of the watchfulness and soberness of this life.
[135]  We have a wonderful hope, a hope that the Lord Jesus will come back and that we shall be raptured to Him.
[136]  In verses 4 through 11 we see the safeguard of faith, love, and hope.
[137]  In verse 4 Paul reminds us that we are not in darkness that the day should overtake us as a thief, and in verse 5 he points out that we are sons of light and of the day, and thus are not of the night nor of darkness.
[138]  Now we come to the crucial matter of understanding what it means to be watchful and sober.
[139]  In verses 9 and 10 Paul says, "Because God did not appoint us to wrath, but to the gaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, Who died for us that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him."
[140]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN COOPERATION WITH THE DIVINE OPERATION 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:12-28
[141]  In verse 13 Paul gives this exhortation: "Be at peace among yourselves."
[142]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE NINETEEN COOPERATION WITH THE DIVINE OPERATION 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:12-28
[143]  When Paul wrote verses 12 through 22 of chapter five, he had much on his heart that he still wanted to say to the new believers in Thessalonica.
[144]  However, because he did not have the time to write further, he listed many different items together in these verses: honoring the leading ones, being at peace, admonishing the disorderly, consoling the fainthearted, upholding the weak, being longsuffering toward all, not rendering evil for evil, always rejoicing, praying unceasingly, giving thanks in everything, not quenching the Spirit, not despising prophecies, proving all things, holding fast what is good, abstaining from every form of evil.
[145]  The command "be preserved" may be regarded as an active-passive verb.
[146]  In verses 25 through 28 we have the conclusion of this Epistle.
[147]  Here Paul says, "But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me."
[148]  Grace in this verse is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection.
[149]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE TWENTY OUR HEART TO BE ESTABLISHED BLAMELESS IN HOLINESS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 3:6a, 10, 12-13; Prov 4:23; Jer 17:9; Psa 73:1; 78:8; Ezek.
[150]  In this message we shall consider what it means to have our heart established blameless in holiness.
[151]  If we have a bird's-eye view of 1 Thessalonians, we shall see that the first three chapters make up one section, and the last two chapters make up another.
[152]  We have seen that this Epistle has a basic structure containing three elements: the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope.
[153]  With this structure as a basis, Paul says in 1:9 and 10 that the believers turned from idols to serve a living and true God and to wait for His Son from the heavens.
[154]  Instead of having an established heart, most Christians have a changeable, movable heart.
[155]  36:26; Matt 5:8; 15:8, 18-19; 12:34-35; 22:37; Acts 28:27; 2 Cor 3:15-16; Rom 10:10; Heb 4:12; 1 Tim 1:5; 2 Tim 2:22
[156]  The Bible tells us that, as human beings, we have inward parts in addition to the outward members of our physical body.
[157]  The soul is the person himself, but the heart is the person in action.
[158]  The second characteristic of a renewed heart is that it seeks purity.
[159]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO OUR HEART TO BE ESTABLISHED BLAMELESS IN HOLINESS AND OUR BODY TO BE PRESERVED CLEAN IN SANCTIFICATION Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 3:13; 4:3-8; Heb 12:14; Rom 12:1-2; Eph 3:17-19; Mark 12:30; Phil 2:5
[160]  In reading the Scriptures we need to touch the burden in the spirit of the writer.
[161]  Paul concludes chapter three of 1 Thessalonians with a word of blessing: "That He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints" v. 13 . Paul's desire was that the readers of this Epistle would be established in their hearts blameless in holiness.
[162]  In chapter four Paul goes on to charge the saints to abstain from the defiling sin of fornication: "For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you abstain from fornication."
[163]  In verse 3 he says that the will of God is our sanctification; in verse 4, that we should know how to possess our vessel, our body, in sanctification and honor; and in verse 7, that God has called us in sanctification.
[164]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that our heart is our acting representative.
[165]  In Romans 12:2 Paul speaks of the renewing of the mind.
[166]  According to Romans 12:1, our body needs to be presented to God as a sacrifice, and our mind needs to be renewed.
[167]  As Paul was writing chapter three of 1 Thessalonians, he must have had the intention to go from the inner being, the heart, to the outer being, the body.
[168]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE TO BE SANCTIFIED WHOLLY WITH OUR SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY PRESERVED COMPLETE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 4:9, 13; 5:8, 16-24; 2 Cor 7:1; 1 John 1:6; 1 Tim 1:5; Rom 6:6, 19; 7:24; 8:10-11; 12:1; 1 Cor 6:13b, 15a, 19-20 A BRIEF SURVEY
[169]  In order to understand this verse, we need to have a brief review of the entire book of 1 Thessalonians.
[170]  Chapter one indicates that the holy life for the church life is constructed of faith, love, and hope.
[171]  He wants to preserve us in the three parts of our being to preserve our spirit, our soul, and our body.
[172]  God not only sanctifies us wholly, but also preserves our spirit, soul, and body complete.
[173]  Such a preservation by God and His thorough sanctification sustain us to live a holy life unto maturity that we may meet the Lord in His parousia.
[174]  Certain verses in chapter five of 1 Thessalonians help us to see that the first way to preserve our spirit is to keep it living through proper exercise.
[175]  Verses 16 through 19 say, "Always rejoice; unceasingly pray; in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
[176]  In 1 Thessalonians 5:23 Paul says, "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[177]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the way to preserve our spirit is first to exercise it to have fellowship with God.
[178]  If we go to the Lord concerning our will, He will expose it in a thorough and detailed way.
[179]  In particular, we shall realize that we are very rebellious, that we do not know what it means to be submissive to the Lord.
[180]  In addition to knowing how to preserve our spirit and our soul, we must also know how to preserve our body.
[181]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND THESSALONIANS MESSAGE ONE A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT Scripture Reading: 2 Thes 1:1-12
[182]  The opening of 2 Thessalonians is very much like that of 1 Thessalonians.
[183]  In 1:1 and 2 Paul says, "Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[184]  On the one hand, it is of human beings, in this case the Thessalonians; on the other hand, it is in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[185]  We have emphasized the fact that the basic structure of the genuine Christian life is constituted of faith, love, and hope.
[186]  Such a life does not originate from the ability of the believers' natural being; it originates from the infusion of what God is into the believers.
[187]  In verse 4 Paul continues, "So that we ourselves boast in you in the churches of God for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which you are bearing."
[188]  In verse 5 Paul goes on to say, "A plain indication of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you are suffering."
[189]  In verse 6 Paul says, "Since it is just with God to repay with affliction those afflicting you."
[190]  This verse indicates that God is judging and that He will judge in the future.
[191]  Verse 9 continues, "Who shall pay the penalty of eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His strength."
[192]  Those who do not know God and those who do not obey the gospel will pay the penalty of eternal destruction.
[193]  In verse 10 Paul speaks of Christ coming to be glorified in His saints: "Whenever He comes to be glorified in His saints, and to be marveled at in all those who have believed because our testimony to you was believed in that day."
[194]  The grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord Himself within us as our life and life supply that we may live a life that will glorify the Lord and be glorified in Him.
[195]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND THESSALONIANS MESSAGE TWO A WORD OF CORRECTION OF THE MISCONCEPTION CONCERNING THE DAY OF THE LORD'S COMING 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Thes 2:1-12
[196]  In verse 1 Paul says, "Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him."
[197]  In verse 4 Paul gives a further description of Antichrist: "Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, so that he seats himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself that he is God."
[198]  In verse 9 Paul says, "The coming of whom is according to the operation of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of a lie."
[199]  In the foregoing message we considered the three main schools of teaching concerning the coming of the Lord Jesus, His parousia, and our gathering together, our rapture, to Him.
[200]  In 2:1 Paul speaks of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him.
[201]  Daniel 9:25 says, "Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times."
[202]  These parables indicate that after the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, God gave up the children of Israel and focused His attention on the church.
[203]  In this message we come to 2:13 3:5, a portion of 2 Thessalonians that contains a further word of encouragement.
[204]  God loved us v. 16 , chose us from the beginning, and called us through the gospel v. 14 . He chose us unto His salvation, which is by sanctification of the Spirit, and He called us to the obtaining of the Lord's glory.
[205]  In verse 13 Paul also speaks of belief of the truth.
[206]  In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, "To which also He called you through our gospel unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[207]  In eternity God chose us unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, and then in time He called us unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord.
[208]  Verse 16 says, "Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and good hope in grace."
[209]  According to this verse, what we have is not temporary and transitory comfort and strengthening, but eternal encouragement.
[210]  In verse 17 Paul says, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father, "Encourage your hearts and establish you in every good work and word."
[211]  If we want God to encourage us, we need to encourage ourselves.
[212]  The love of God in this verse is our love toward God that issues from the love of God 1 John 4:19 that has been poured out into our hearts.
[213]  The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians contain a total of eight chapters.
[214]  But where does Paul speak of hope in 2 Thessalonians?
[215]  Paul's first reference to the believers' hope is in 1:4, where Paul says that he boasts of their endurance and faith in all their persecutions and afflictions.
[216]  THE DEGREE OF OUR SALVATION AND THE EXTENT OF OUR SANCTIFICATION
[217]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND THESSALONIANS MESSAGE SIX CHOSEN BY GOD UNTO SALVATION IN SANCTIFICATION OF THE SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Thes 1:3-5, 10-11; 2:13-14, 16
[218]  The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians were written in an elementary way because they are letters to young saints, to new believers.
[219]  I would like to say a word especially to the young people.
[220]  Because you were selected by God in eternity past, there is no point in trying to run away from Him.
[221]  Every day, even every minute, we are being sanctified.
[222]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND THESSALONIANS MESSAGE SEVEN A CONCLUDING WORD Scripture Reading: 2 Thes 3:6-18
[223]  In 3:6-15 we have Paul's word of correction of the disorderly walk, and in 3:16-18, we have Paul's conclusion.
[224]  In 3:6 he says, "Now we charge you, brothers, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the tradition which you received from us."
[225]  In verses 7 through 9 Paul reminds the Thessalonians that, in the matter of orderly living, the apostles were a pattern to them: "For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not disorderly among you; nor did we eat bread as a gift from anyone, but in labor and hardship we worked night and day that we might not be burdensome to any of you; not that we do not have the right, but that we might give ourselves to you as a pattern to imitate us."
[226]  Verse 16 says, "Now the Lord of peace Himself give you peace continually in every way.
[227]  Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians are concerned with such a holy life, a life that is separated unto God and sanctified wholly by God and for God.
