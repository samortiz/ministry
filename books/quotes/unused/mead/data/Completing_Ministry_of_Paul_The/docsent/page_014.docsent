   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. THE WARRIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the exhortations in Ephesians 6:11-18 we can see that the church is also a warrior, needing the whole armor of God to stand against the stratagems of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this universe a war is raging.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church must be a fighter, battling for God s kingdom and against God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is not only a man, a bride, God s family, and His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is also a warrior, equipped by God to do battle against Satan and the powers of darkness under him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The troubles that happen on this earth come mainly from these evil, spiritual powers in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the church which must stand against these evil powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This warfare is waged not in the church s own strength but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He Himself is the armor provided by God for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is up to us, however, to take up and put on the armor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the girdle for our loins, the shield to quench Satan s flaming darts, the helmet of salvation, and the sword to slay the foe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We put on Christ, wearing Him like a garment and hiding in Him, to fight the battle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ten descriptions of the church that we have already considered the mystery of Christ, His Body, His fullness, the new man, His bride, God s masterpiece, God s family, the kingdom of God, God s dwelling place, and the warrior are all found in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the last two descriptions we turn now to Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Galatians 6:10 the church is called the household of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Paul s completing ministry here is yet another revelation of what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The household of the faith is a specific term; it means the family of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Galatians Paul sets the law and faith in contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Judaizers are people of the law, while the believers are the family of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One belongs to the Old Testament, the other to the New.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This term, the faith, indicates God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a comprehensive way of saying that what God is doing now is nothing less than dispensing Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may say that faith is a bundle, wrapping up God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This faith comes into us by our knowing and appreciating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we hear of Him, we begin to know Him and, correspondingly, to appreciate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Out of this appreciation, faith is produced within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We thus receive Christ and have the Triune God dispensed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All of this thought is included in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We belong to this faith, not to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The law cannot give life; thus, it has no family.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The people of the law are without life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The faith, in contrast, imparts life, even God Himself, into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, faith has a family.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We believers are the household of the begetting faith!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are the members of a family that is spread throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This family has a name: the household of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are members of this great family of the faith the church!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE ISRAEL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament God had a people to be His testimony, expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the New Testament the real Israel of God is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Israel of God is the term Paul uses in Galatians 6:16.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is today the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is Israel in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not the real Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The real Israel of God today is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus there are two Israels: the one in the flesh, located in what was called Palestine, and the one in the Spirit, to which we belong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul tells us that as many as walk according to the rule of the new creation are the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Have you ever considered that you are a real Jew?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you do not realize this, you are not familiar enough with the completing ministry of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because of Galatians 6:16 I dare to say that I am a real Jew!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Jews in the land of Israel are not the real Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you visit there, you will find that they do not express God at all; the situation is worldly and even sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That was my impression when I stayed there for some days a few years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nonetheless, they are still the Israel of God, but in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are the Israel of God in Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the blessings promised by God in the Bible are our portion because we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This wonderful church is revealed to us in Paul s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He has surely completed the Word of God Col 1:25 .</S>
