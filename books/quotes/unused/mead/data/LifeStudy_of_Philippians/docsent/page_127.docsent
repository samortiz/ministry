   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-THREE CHRIST, SALVATION, GOD,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE WORD OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:5-16 we have Christ, salvation, God, and the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are the four basic elements of the structure of these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 5 Paul presents Christ as our pattern: Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then Paul goes on to describe this Christ, saying that He was obedient unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 12 Paul speaks of working out our own salvation, and in verse 13 he goes on to say that God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we have Christ as the pattern of our salvation and we must work out our own salvation according to God s operation in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The issue of God s operation within us is that we hold forth the word of life v. 16 . Hence, the four basic elements in 2:5-16 are Christ, salvation, God, and the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we shall consider how these four elements are related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CHRIST AS THE PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we would experience Christ and live Him, we must know Him as our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 2:5-11 Paul presents Christ as our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to be deeply impressed with this pattern and even have it infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is wonderful; He truly is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the book of Colossians we have seen that Christ is both all-inclusive and universally extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This all-inclusive Christ is nothing less than God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But even though He is equal with God, He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men v. 7 . He did not regard His equality with God as a thing to grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, He laid aside this equality and emptied Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This does not mean, however, that Christ was no longer God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It simply means that He put aside His outward expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although He subsisted in the form of God, He took on the form of a slave and became in the likeness of men and in the fashion of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, He had the appearance of a man instead of the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, having the form of God, Christ emptied Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the Savior, Christ has both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He both emptied Himself and humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, according to verses 6 through 8, we may speak of the self-emptying and self-humbling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Philippians 2:9 says, Wherefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This verse indicates that God came in to exalt Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For Christ to be exalted means not only that He was uplifted to the third heaven from the lower parts of the earth; it also means that in a glorious way He was brought back with His human nature to the form of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before His incarnation, Christ did not have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But through incarnation He took on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then He brought this human nature to the cross, shedding His blood for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After His resurrection, He was uplifted to the heavens and with His human nature was brought back to the form of God in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now He is our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The pattern of the Christian life is the God-man Savior who emptied Himself and humbled Himself and who was exalted and glorified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>REPRINTING THE PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The very pattern revealed in 2:5-11 must now become our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is indicated by the words so then at the beginning of verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After giving us a clear view of Christ as our wonderful pattern, Paul says, So then, my beloved... work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As our pattern, Christ is both inclusive and exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The pattern is exclusive because it excludes everything worldly, fleshly, or sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no way for negative things to have any part in Him or access to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But, on the positive side, He is all-inclusive, for He is the God-man Savior who emptied and humbled Himself and who has been exalted and glorified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With such a pattern available to us, we now must work out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To work out our salvation is to work out this pattern and to become in our experience a reprint of the pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ as the pattern can be compared to a page of type used in printing a book, and our subjective experience of the pattern becoming our salvation can be compared to the printing of the pages of a book.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In making a book, each page of type is reprinted again and again until there are many copies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our experience, the God-man Savior should be reprinted and become our subjective salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The very salvation we are to work out is Christ as our pattern.</S>
