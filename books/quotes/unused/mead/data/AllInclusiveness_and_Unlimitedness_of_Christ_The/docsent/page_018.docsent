   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT RELIGION BUT THE LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because no one speaks about this, most of today's Christians consider the Bible the divine revelation as a religious classic.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They look on the Christian truths as a religion which teaches people according to a set of beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of some knowledge of God and reverence for God, they worship Him, and since they worship God, they teach people according to this One whom they worship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They may say, "As a wife who fears God, you must behave properly by submitting to your husband that you may glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a husband who worships God, you also must love your wife with all gentleness that you may glorify God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot say that this kind of teaching is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we must realize that this kind of moral and ethical teaching is religion, in which people are taught according to whom they worship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Strictly speaking, this violates God's spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is God's spiritual principle?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul said in Galatians 2:20, "I am crucified with Christ," that is, only when I am finished can Christ propagate Himself into me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Remember that Paul spoke this word to a group of Christians who had been under Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This group of religionists who were fervent for Judaism, on the one hand, received the Lord Jesus, and on the other hand, brought the practice of law-keeping into the midst of the Christians, so that they became a people with two religions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were a people who were, on the one hand, Christians, and on the other hand, Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul was originally a Judaizer, but when the Lord met him on the way to Damascus, he turned fully from the Jewish religion to Christ, not to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was why he declared boldly that he had died to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How did he die?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not die by committing suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, he was brought to the cross by Christ to die with Him in His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who is this Jesus who lives in us?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the Spirit who was breathed into the disciples in John 20.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This Spirit is the Christ who lived in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not Christianity but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not religion but the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not to teach according to a set of beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, this is to pass through the death of the cross and allow Christ to multiply and increase in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because to us to live is Christ, our love is far more transcendent than the love of a husband who loves his wife by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because to us to live is Christ, our submission is much more spontaneous than the submission of a wife who submits to her husband by clenching her teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since our submission is not merely a human submission but a submission that is lived out by the Holy Spirit and Christ in us, it is transcendent and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hallelujah, this is the multiplication and increase of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If as a wife you abide by religious doctrines, trying cautiously and fearfully to be a good wife every day by submitting to your husband, or if as a husband you restrain yourself with fear and trembling to be a good husband, this is not Christ's multiplication or His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At most, Christ has gained you as a disciple or an apprentice whom He can teach to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has not entered into you to make you His multiplication and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even though you love your wife to the uttermost, you cannot say, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, you can boast by saying, "It is I who live."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You cannot say, "It is no longer I"; rather, you can say, "Much more it is I."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if you say, "Much more it is I," this is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In God's economy, He does not care for you or me to be this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He only cares for Christ's multiplication and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters, if the truth which we preach is different from what is preached in Christianity, the difference lies in the multiplication and increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What a pity that today in many church buildings you cannot hear such teachings concerning the multiplication and increase of Christ, and you cannot find such textbooks in the Bible seminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, we harbor a hope that the truths which we have seen in these years will be spread among Christians in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At this point, we have labored for eleven years to have two trainings every year, one in the summer and one in the winter, to specifically study the twenty-seven books in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have already finished twenty-six books.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Recently, we published a set of nine volumes of life-studies on the exposition of Paul's fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We hope that these truths can be spread to every part of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have already started to do this in America.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In America, there are several dozen churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We encourage each church to contact their local libraries, especially the libraries of the Bible seminaries, and donate a set to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now at least a few dozen sets have been given away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those libraries generally welcome receiving this set of life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do this in the hope that these truths will spread everywhere and reach everywhere that all may be blessed in the same way.</S>
