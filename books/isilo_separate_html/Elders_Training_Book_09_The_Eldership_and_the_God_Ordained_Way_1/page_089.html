As we have said, we Christians should be "crazy" all the time. We should be "crazy" with the Lord, filled up with His Spirit and His word. Then we will attend any meeting in a "crazy" way. We should not go to a meeting like a "flat tire," without being filled with the Spirit and the word. This is why we need to have a new revival every morning so that we can be revived persons. Then we need to continue to exercise our spirit to be overcoming and victorious every day. We need to attend every meeting as revived persons.</P><P>The meeting should actually start before we leave our home. We should go to the group gathering singing and praying. While we are on the way to meet with the saints, we may sing, "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! I have passed the riven veil, Here the glories never fail" (Hymns, #551). When we arrive at the meeting place, what shall we do? According to our old way, we would sit there in silence and wait for the meeting to begin. But the "crazy way" is not like that. We should start the meeting in our home, singing and praying in the car on the way. When we come into the meeting place, we should continue to pray. When others come, they can join our prayer.</P><P>After the prayer, someone may share that a certain brother lost his job today. This is fellowship. Then there can be some prayer for this brother. The fellowship brings in the interceding, the interceding brings in the mutual care, and the mutual care brings in the practical shepherding. After praying for the brother who lost his job, someone may ask what his profession is. Then another brother may say that his company needs such a person. This is an example of mutual care and shepherding. We have to practice this. This will make everyone living. Everyone feels free and has the boldness to share something.</P><P>Following this fellowship and interceding, questions will be asked. No one should be assigned to answer these questions. Everyone should answer them. Someone may ask what the cross is, and a young brother who was saved just three weeks ago can answer this question. He may say, "Formerly I did not know what the cross was. But just recently a brother told me that it was a means used by the Roman government to put to death the worst criminals." His answer is a short teaching. Another brother may continue by saying, "The cross was where the Lord Jesus was crucified. He was crucified there on behalf of us to take away our sins." Then he may read one verse referring to this. Another brother may say, "When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was crucified not only for our sins but also for us." He would also give a verse to support what he has shared. Another brother can add something more by saying, "Today we have to experience the cross of the Lord Jesus. We can experience the cross by applying the death of Christ on the cross to our situation. When we are about to lose our temper, we need to call on the Lord. This brings us into the death of Christ in the Spirit." This brother may then continue to share something further concerning the experience of the cross of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_088.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_090.html">Next</a> </body></html>
