Paul said that he wanted to know Christ and the power of His resurrection. This power will conform us to Christ's death (Phil. 3:10b; 2 Cor. 4:10, 16).</P><P>The more we die, the more Spirit we have. The more we die, the more we are in resurrection. The more we die, the more the divine attributes, such as peace, joy, light, life, and love, will be with us to be the content of our human virtues. This is the Christian life, and this is the great mystery of godliness (1 Tim. 3:16). Godliness is the living out of the Triune God, the very manifestation of the divine Being in our flesh.</P><P>We need to be people who are occupied with the Triune God, with the consummated Spirit, and with the resurrection. We need to be "crazy" Christians who are filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly. We should be fully in resurrection. What is resurrection? Resurrection is the processed, consummated Triune God as the compound Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> </body></html>
