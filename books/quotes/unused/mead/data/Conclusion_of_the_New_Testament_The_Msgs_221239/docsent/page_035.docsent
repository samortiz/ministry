   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>J. To Reign with Christ and to Be Priests of God and Christ in the Millennium</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 20:4b says, "They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 6b tells us, "They shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, in 2 Timothy 2:12a Paul says, "If we endure, we shall also reign with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These verses indicate that in the coming manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ as His co-kings and that they will be priests of God and of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some today teach that all the believers will be kings and priests in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This teaching is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the millennium only the overcoming Christians, not all the believers, will be kings and priests.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who will reign with Christ in the millennial kingdom are those who live in the reality of the kingdom today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then, in the coming age, they will be in the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To Be Crowned</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These crowns include the crown of righteousness, the unfading crown of glory, the crown of life, and an incorruptible crown. a. With the Crown of Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2 Timothy 4:8 Paul says, "There is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved His appearing."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord's salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race 1 Cor 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This prize is neither of grace nor by faith as salvation is Eph 2:5, 8-9 ; rather, this prize is of righteousness through works Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12; 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a reward will be awarded to the believers not according to the grace of the Lord, but according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, it is a crown of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The One who awards it is the Lord as the righteous Judge, not as the merciful God or the gracious Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved, laid up, for him and would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord's second appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul says that such an award will be given to all who love the Lord's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord's appearing, His coming back, is a warning, an encouragement, and an incentive to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should love it and look forward to it with earnest expectation and joy. b.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the Unfading Crown of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Peter 5:4 says, "When the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At Peter's time, crowns were given to victors in athletic games and warfare 1 Cor 9:25; 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those were corruptible crowns, whose glory faded.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The crown given by the Lord to the overcomers will be a reward to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The glory of this crown will never fade.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers' enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ 2 Pet 1:11 .</S>
