   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A LIFE WITHIN THE VEIL 6:4-13 A. The Beloved's Praise 6:4-9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the maiden arrives at this stage, we see the Lord's satisfaction in her.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This book speaks of a progressive union; the purpose of the union is fellowship, while the meaning of fellowship is identification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the maiden sees in the King what she has experienced in the King.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The King sees the manifestation of His life in the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The King's praise is a proclamation of the riches the believers have received through their union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 4 says, "Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord is viewing the believers from heaven, from within the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, this is something which happens within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord has mentioned her beauty and comeliness previously.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the beauty and comeliness in this verse are more restricted than before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, "Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tirzah is where the palace is 1 Kings 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jerusalem is the city of the great King.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tirzah signifies the heavenly sanctuary, the dwelling of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jerusalem signifies the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is examining our heavenly nature and life within the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In that Jerusalem everything is comely, and in that Tirzah everything is beautiful, because both are God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today believers are already displaying the beauty and comeliness of the coming sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Weapons are the most important thing to an army in battle, whereas the banner is the most important thing in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the battle is lost, the banner is put away in shame.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An unfurled banner signifies the glory of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse indicates that the maiden is beautiful and comely before the Lord, as solid as the heavenly city and as serene as the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the same time, she displays the glory of her victory before the enemy and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A life within the veil is not just a life before the Lord, but a life before the enemy, because the heaven in which the saints dwell is the very heaven which the enemy assails.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has no intention for His believers to possess only the heavenly beauty without possessing a warring nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The heavenly warfare is never abated before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Believers ought to be lovable and terrible at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Believers today have lost their loveliness before the Lord, and they have lost their terribleness before the enemy and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are men terrified by us?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible often mentions the terribleness of the Lord; He is terrible because He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we maintain our holiness and victory, we will see the enemy retreating and the world standing back.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But believers today have sacrificed their terribleness, and neither men nor demons are afraid of them any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 5a says, "Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first phrase in verse 5 is a poetic expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The power of love is expressed by the affection in the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord is not rejecting the believers' love; rather, there is the element of encouragement and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as He turned down the Syrophoenician woman Mark 7:25-29 , delayed two days before going up to Judea John 11:5-7 , told Moses, "Let me alone" Exo 32:10 , and allowed Jacob to hold on to Him Gen 32:26 , He is inviting the maiden's expression of love with a word of seeming rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Turning away is the opposite of fixing one's eyes upon an object.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This speaks not only of love, but of the firmness of love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seems that He has become weak before her love; this weakness in Him has been displayed often in the face of love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He seems to give a hint of His total helplessness, apparent failure, and lack of defense before love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only those who have experienced the Lord's apparent rejection, delay, denial, and helplessness know the way of the Lord.</S>
