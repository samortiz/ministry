   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOSPEL SERVICE 2 Scripture Reading: Mark 6:1-44</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We come in this message to 6:1-44.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this section of the Gospel of Mark we have four matters: the Slave-Savior being despised by the Nazarenes vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1-6 , the sending forth of the twelve to preach vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>7-13 , the martyrdom of the forerunner of the gospel 6:14-29 , and the feeding of the five thousand vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>30-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we read 6:1-44, it may appear that this section is not impressive concerning the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It may seem to us that the four incidents recorded here are merely stories.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we believe that this record is part of the holy Scriptures breathed out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, this chapter was written by Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, it is an inspired portion of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we need to look to the Lord for insight in order that we may get into the depths of such a record.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A PICTURE OF REJECTION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, in 6:1-6 the Lord was despised and rejected by the Nazarenes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, this rejection did not disturb Him or disappoint Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though He left them because of their rejection of Him, this does not mean that He was disappointed or that He gave them up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Slave-Savior wanted to do something for the Nazarenes, but they would not open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mark 6:5 says, And He could not do any work of power there, except to lay His hands upon a few sick people and heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The unbelief of the Nazarenes kept the Lord from doing many works of power among them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead of being discouraged and disappointed by the rejection of the Nazarenes, the Lord was encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is proved by the fact that in 6:7-13 He sent out the twelve to do the same thing He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In particular, He gave them authority over the unclean spirits v. 7 . The Lord appointed the twelve to do what He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 6:14-29 we have the martyrdom of the forerunner of the gospel, John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Humanly speaking, this must have been very disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, the Lord Jesus was not disappointed even by the martyrdom of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Following John s martyrdom, we have the case of the Lord s feeding and satisfying the five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The rejection of the Jews in His country did not disappoint Him; rather, that rejection encouraged Him to send out His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, the martyrdom of His forerunner did not disappoint Him; instead, it encouraged Him to feed more people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 4:35 5:43 we saw how the kingdom of God meets the need of the human condition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we pointed out, the situation of human society is portrayed in this section of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Human society, and every individual human being as well, is full of storms of rebellion, demons, unclean industry hog raising , death-sickness, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the actual situation of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the Slave-Savior has brought the kingdom to us, and the kingdom is the answer to the condition of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The kingdom subdues rebellion, the kingdom casts out demons, the kingdom clears up the unclean industry, the kingdom heals the sick, and the kingdom raises the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 4:35 5:43 we see a demonstration of the kingdom of God meeting the needs of human society.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a wonderful picture this is!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 6:1-44 Mark presents a different picture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this picture we see rejection, hatred, and martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how much blessing is brought in by the kingdom and the preaching of the gospel, the world still hates and rejects the Slave-Savior and those who work together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 6:1-44, therefore, we see the attitude of the worldly people toward the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What shall we do in the face of such an attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What should we do when we are despised, rejected, and hated, and when some are even killed?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Should we be disappointed?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Should we stop preaching the glad tidings and cease from our work for the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead of being disappointed, we should be encouraged by the negative attitude shown by the worldly people toward the gospel.</S>
