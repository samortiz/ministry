   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S SUFFICIENCY IN MEETING MAN S NEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen the condition and need of man in these nine cases.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we must see how the Lord is able to come into man s fallen condition and meet his every need.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In every case, the Lord presents Himself as the One who could fulfill the deficiencies of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These nine cases fully prove the Lord s sufficiency to meet man s every need.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first case shows that the Lord can afford us regeneration, which even a superior person such as Nicodemus needed that he might have the life of God for the entrance into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The case of the Samaritan woman, a sinful and unsatisfied woman, reveals how much the Lord can satisfy such a person with His living water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the case of the dying man, the Lord is the healing power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The case of the weak man who had been sick for thirty-eight years demonstrates the enlivening power of the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the case of the hungry multitude which needed something to feed on, the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the case of the thirsty people, the Lord assures them that He can quench their thirst by the flowing river of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the case of the woman living in sin, we see that the Lord is able to deliver such a one from her sinful situation and release her from the bondage of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the case of the blind man, the Lord opens his eyes and gives him sight.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Finally, in the case of Lazarus, who had died, had been buried, and was even decaying in the grave, the power of the Lord s resurrection life is fully exhibited.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In all of these cases the Lord s sufficiency in meeting man s need is adequately proved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is not one of man s conditions that He cannot solve.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is not a need that He cannot meet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is able!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is sufficient!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He can deal with all our problems and supply all our needs!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praise His name!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>REGENERATION PREREQUISITE TO FULL SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All aspects of the Lord s work as shown and signified in these nine cases are the different aspects of the Lord s full salvation, which are 1 regeneration, 2 the satisfaction with the living water, 3 the healing power of life, 4 the enlivening with the power of life, 5 the feeding with the bread of life, 6 the quenching of thirst with the rivers of living water, 7 the deliverance from sin, 8 the opening of the blind eyes, and 9 resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of these items are included in the Lord s salvation, the first of which is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regeneration is the start of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All spiritual experiences begin with regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have regeneration, we are then qualified to participate in all the other items of the Lord s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regeneration is a prerequisite to the experience of all the other items of the Lord s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason that the case of regeneration is recorded as the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the experiences of the other items depend upon the experience of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before we can be satisfied with the living water, we must first be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The living water issues from the initial experience of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without regeneration, the Lord s living water can never be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The principle is the same with all the other experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A dying person needs to be regenerated that he may be healed and live eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A weak person must first be regenerated; then he can be enlivened with the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person must first be regenerated before he can feed upon the Lord as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To enjoy the nourishment of life depends very much upon regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To have the flow of living water is also dependent upon regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are not regenerated, you could never have your thirst quenched by the Lord s living water.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be delivered from sin and to have our blind eyes opened both require that we first be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without regeneration, it is impossible for anyone to partake of the deliverance from sin or to receive spiritual sight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, no one can participate in resurrection life before experiencing regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord s salvation begins with regeneration and ends with resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we need to examine very carefully the first case, the case of Nicodemus, which reveals man s need for regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I. THE LORD S COMMITMENT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before we consider the case of Nicodemus, we need to realize that the Lord s commitment to man is not in miracles, but in life 2:23 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word But in 3:1 indicates that the case of Nicodemus differs from the cases in the foregoing verses, 2:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the cases there are cases of people believing in the Lord because of seeing the miracles He did.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord could not commit Himself to such people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the case of Nicodemus, a case of life in regeneration, reveals that the Gospel of John is not for miraculous things, but only for life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why even the miracles done by the Lord are called signs in this book, signifying that the Lord came for life, not for miracles.</S>
