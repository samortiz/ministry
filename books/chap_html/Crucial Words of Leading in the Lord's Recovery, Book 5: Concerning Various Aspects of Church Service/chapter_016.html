<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE SUPPLY OF THE WORD<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You. We need the cleansing of Your blood. We confess that even today we have unconsciously been contaminated in many ways. Cleanse our conscience, cleanse our feeling, and cleanse our condition. We confess that we are truly weak and ignorant and that we are not useful. Lord, please lead us. We look to You. You are the source, and You are what the Body needs. We open, and we give ourselves to You unreservedly. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning more than three thousand saints listen to Your word; we do not want to take this matter lightly. Lord, how will You lead us? Reveal Your heart&rsquo;s desire again to us. Lord, only You know what we should do concerning the supply of the word in the small groups and after the table meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We present ourselves before You. Cause each of us to feel a sense of responsibility and to not be spectators but rather be involved in bearing the Ark. Lord, we cry out to You again. Have mercy on us and do not cast us into darkness. Lead us. Amen.</p>
<p>With regard to the supply of the word in the big meetings on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning and in the small groups, I am still not at rest. I hope that those who bear the responsibility to minister the word will regard this matter seriously. They should not take it lightly. We must regard the supply of the word very seriously.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING<br />
ON THE SUPPLY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>It is difficult for a local church that does not receive the supply of the rich, fresh, and living word to be strong. The strength of a church depends on the supply of the word. We can compare this to a family. Whether or not the members of the family are healthy depends on the person who distributes the food. If poison is supplied, one meal can kill the entire family. If only pea pods are supplied, everyone in the family will become very thin. If nutritious food is supplied, every member will be healthy. Hence, all the brothers who bear the responsibility to supply the word must regard this matter seriously. They should not consider it a light matter.</p>
<p>According to our present situation, it would be excellent if the message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning could be coordinated with the message being read in the small groups. However, we are not sure that we are able to use the Life-study messages one way in the small group meetings and use them in a totally new way for the Lord&rsquo;s Day message. If we use the messages in the same way, the saints may lose their appetite and stop coming to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting. God&rsquo;s word is rich. The same message can be touched in one way in the small group meetings and in a completely different way on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Hence, the brothers responsible for the word in each meeting hall must have thorough fellowship concerning this matter and consider every aspect of our situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Keeping the Central Line</h2>
<p><em>Question: Every week we read a Life-study message in our morning time, we fellowship concerning the same message in the small group meeting, and on Lord&rsquo;s Day we fellowship again concerning the same message. We do not want to merely repeat the same content in the message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, but we are afraid to use our own utterance. As a result, we feel apprehensive, because we are not sure whether we are on the central point.</em></p>
<p>Answer: Let us take Message 1 of the <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> as an example. The opening section says that the book of Galatians is related to Christ; it is a book on Christ. It says that Galatians speaks of Christ and of how this Christ becomes our experience. It is not a problem for us to develop this point. Another section of the first message is concerning the background and subject of Galatians. The background of this book is that Judaism with its laws was replacing Christ. This is a general statement and does not seem to apply to us. Since we are neither Jews nor in the atmosphere of Judaism, how does this statement relate to us? When the brothers release the message, they need to apply this point to themselves. This is the way to develop the central subject so that others get the benefit.</p>
<p>I have given messages for over fifty years, and I know that nothing is more serious than being an outlet of the word. Even today I confess that I still do not know how to give a message. When I was in school, economics was a broad subject that involved political science, geography, social science, and finances. A person who wants to be an expert in economics has to be well versed in these relevant fields. However, I have realized that a person who speaks for the Lord needs an almost unlimited amount of knowledge. We must possess not only general knowledge concerning many things; we must also have cursory knowledge of the biographies of spiritual men. Then when we speak, even when we give examples, we can apply our knowledge.</p>
<p>However, our speaking should not cover too many subjects. The primary matter is to keep the central line. Whatever we say must follow the central line. I can boast to you, and the saints who have listened to my messages for over thirty years can testify, that my messages have never changed. This is because I saw a vision in 1935, and this vision has captured me such that I always center on it no matter what I say. We have developed many new terms, because as more and more riches are unearthed, new utterances are required. Nevertheless, we have continually stayed on the central line of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
