<div class='line'><b>1</b> My old person has been nullified;</div>
<div class='line'>With my Lord upon the cross he died;</div>
<div class='line'>Now in nothing shall he be applied;</div>
<div class='line'>He's dead to me.</div>
<div class='line'>My new Person in my spirit dwells;</div>
<div class='line'>Springing in me as a bubbling well;</div>
<div class='line'>Flowing out until each part He fills</div>
<div class='line'>With abundant life.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>Christ, my Person, in my spirit lives;</div>
<div class='line'>And my heart to Him I'd daily give;</div>
<div class='line'>That my inner man could have a home</div>
<div class='line'>And a place to settle down, yes,</div>
<div class='line'>A place to call His own, and -</div>
<div class='line'>There be my complete reality,</div>
<div class='line'>There expressing all He is to me,</div>
<div class='line'>Living in my heart abundantly</div>
<div class='line'>As my Person real.</div>

<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> By this Person being formed in me,</div>
<div class='line'>I'll a member of His Body be,</div>
<div class='line'>No more acting individually,</div>
<div class='line'>But with the saints.</div>
<div class='line'>More and more our Person He must be;</div>
<div class='line'>That our natural personality</div>
<div class='line'>Be eliminated thoroughly</div>
<div class='line'>Till Christ is all.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>Only Christ, our Person, must remain;</div>
<div class='line'>From our aims, our goals we must refrain,</div>
<div class='line'>Till the church be only Christ Himself</div>
<div class='line'>Built up as the one new man,</div>
<div class='line'>Thus fulfilling God's great plan of -</div>
<div class='line'>Mingling fully with the human race</div>
<div class='line'>To obtain a proper dwelling place,</div>
<div class='line'>'Stablishing His kingdom's rule and grace;</div>
<div class='line'>Over all the earth.</div>
<div class='line'>Not Himself just individually,</div>
<div class='line'>But the church together corporately,</div>
<div class='line'>Taking Christ as all in all, to be</div>
<div class='line'>The full-grown, perfect man.</div>
