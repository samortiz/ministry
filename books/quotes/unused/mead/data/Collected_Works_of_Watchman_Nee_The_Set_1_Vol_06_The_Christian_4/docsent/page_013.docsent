   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many people cannot understand how someone can be saved merely by believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Their difficulty lies in being unable to feel that they have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I often hear people saying, "I have truly believed in the Lord Jesus as my Savior, but in my heart I still cannot feel that I am saved."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us read Exodus 12:13, "And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who saw the blood?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God saw it, not the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The blood was applied to the upper doorpost and side posts; the firstborn could not see it, and even if they could, it would have been of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God said that He would see the blood, and when He saw the blood, He would not smite us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not realize how much value there is in the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot understand how God profoundly values the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But God said that when He saw the blood, He would pass over.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He will save all those who have the precious blood of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our duty is to believe in the Lord Jesus' substitutional death and His shedding of the blood on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God sees the blood, He will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether we feel it or not matters little.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Scripture does not say that we are saved when we feel that we are saved, and that if we do not feel so, then we will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What the Scripture says is that God will pass over when He sees the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, dear friends, do not rely on your volatile feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's words are reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He sees us believing in the Lord Jesus, He will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What more do we have to fear?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if we feel nothing, God has already seen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Could the Israelites, who remained indoors, see the blood on their upper doorpost?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, there is nothing strange if we do not feel anything!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some brothers always worry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They think that they are not yet saved, even though they have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior, because they repeatedly fall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more they look at themselves, the more they think they are unworthy to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They honestly believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They know the grace of the Lord is great; however, when they look at their own failures, they are unable to believe that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But these thoughts are in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us again read God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"When I see the blood, I will pass over you" Exo 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the basis for God's salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does God see?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible says that God sees the blood and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God saves us because of the precious blood of the Lord Jesus and only because of the precious blood of His Son, not because of a change in ourselves or in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Scripture does not say, "When I see your good conduct, I will pass over you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nor does it say, "When I see your perfect life, I will pass over you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It says, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The blood!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must pay attention to the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God sees the blood, not us, or even less, our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Salvation and damnation are according to the presence or absence of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if you were the best man in the world, if you do not believe in the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, you are still a man of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you were the worst man in the world, and by faith applied the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, you would immediately be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The precious blood can save sinners!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The precious blood is especially for saving sinners!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast" Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are saved entirely by the grace of God; it has absolutely nothing to do with our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we look at ourselves, the more we will feel that we are not worthy to be saved and have less peace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we should look to the Lord Jesus and rely on Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Look to Him, and we will have peace and joy in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we are not trustworthy, He is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more we look to Him, the more we will be purified and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Israelites were saved because they relied on the blood of the lamb, not because of their own merits.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Egyptians perished because they did not have the precious blood of the lamb, not because of their evil deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Salvation or perdition depends on whether we rely on the precious blood of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we have the precious blood, then we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Otherwise, our situation is dangerous!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let us now leave the Israelites and come to the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose we entered into an Egyptian house and found them enjoying their family life, and I asked, "Why are you so happy?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God said that He will kill your son by midnight tonight!"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They might answer, "Sir, my son is different from other people's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He has never committed murder or arson.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is just and honest.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He has done everything according to his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Will God punish such a man?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I would say, "If you do not have the blood of the lamb on your upper doorpost, God will not pass over him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He will destroy him."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They might respond, "Others may need the blood of the lamb, but good people have no need of the blood of the lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When midnight came, their son would perish!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Let me tell you, the consequence for all those who rely on their own righteousness, rather than the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, is eternal perdition!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although you are better than your neighbor, and in the eyes of the world you are an honest man, can your small merit save you from the wrath of the most righteous God?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All our righteousness is not up to God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He still sees us as sinners; without the blood of the Lamb for our ransom, we will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although the Israelites were evil as we see from their experience in the wilderness , they had the blood of the lamb to redeem them from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although the Egyptians may have been good, they did not have the blood of the lamb to redeem them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, they perished.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Salvation or perdition is not according to ourselves or our behavior; it is according to whether we accept the redeeming Savior who has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the book of Revelation the ones in heaven are there because of the precious blood of the Lamb, not because of their own conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Saved ones can go to heaven because they "have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" Rev 7:9-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As the Passover approached and the hours ticked away, the time came!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The hour of judgment came!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>"At midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt" Exo 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is the destiny of those who do not believe in the gospel of the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I advise you to no longer rely on your own conduct because of the imminent coming of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Do not excuse yourself or delay any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Believe quickly in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>While today is still today, come quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>"Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation" 2 Cor 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>"There was not a house where there was not one dead" Exo 12:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In every Egyptian house, someone died.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even the Israelite homes were not without their dead!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Both the Egyptian and Israelites had a death in each house!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The only difference was that in the houses of the Israelites, the dead one was a lamb, while in the Egyptian houses it was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In every house there was death, either of a person or of a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>How frightful!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>How solemn!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Either a man or a lamb died.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Dear readers, I do not know who you would rather see die.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Would you rather bear all your sins and die, or would you believe in and rely on Jesus, the Lamb of God, and let Him die for you?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Either you die or He dies for you; it is either one or the other!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If the Lord Jesus does not die for you, then you must die.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Who will die?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Thank and praise God because "while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" Rom 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>You do not have to die; you do not have to perish for your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>From this point on, you will not perish because you are a sinner, but because you have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Therefore, do not let the Lord Jesus say to you, "You are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" John 5:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>"Let him who wills take the water of life freely" Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>How I desire that you would just come to God with a believing heart, praying, "O God, I am a sinner who deserves perdition, but I believe that your Son has died for me.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Forgive all my previous sins so that from now on I will be saved."</S>
