Actually, freedom from the denominations only frees us from man's authority. We are still under the Lord's authority. In our daily lives and work, God has appointed many representative authorities for us to learn submission. If a man says that he cannot find any authority to submit to, something must be wrong with such a person. When a family gathers together we surely find all kinds of authorities. The parents are the authority to children, grandparents are the authority to parents, and older brothers and sisters are the authority to younger brothers and sisters. When we are at home, we have to submit to authority. When we are away from home, the policemen on the streets are our authority, and we have to submit to them. We cannot overturn their authority just because we do not feel like submitting to them.</p><p>If a responsible brother of an assembly wants to know if he should be a responsible one, the best way is for him to ask others whether they feel he should be a responsible one. The other brothers need not be political. If a responsible brother is doing a good job, he can go on. Otherwise, he should resign.</p><h2 class="head2">Prayer of Authority</h2><p>When something arises in an assembly that is beyond human control, the church should exercise its authority to pray and ask the Lord to intervene. If a work in a locality is carried out according to the Lord's will, His throne will support and be behind such a work. This is like the British embassy in China. It is here to represent England, and the ambassador executes the move of the British throne. If anyone kills an ambassador, it is an insult to the whole of England. In the same way, if an assembly in a locality is a representative and testimony of the Lord, His authority will be behind this assembly. If necessary, the responsible ones should exercise the Lord's authority to stop all the frustrating elements.</p><p>We have to help people to know that the church is where God's authority lies today. It is the place where the Lord's throne is established. Anyone who comes to the church should know the authority of the church. The workers are the representatives of the Lord, and they have the authority of the Lord with them. First Thessalonians 5:12 and Hebrews 13:7 and 17 indicate that the workers should receive double honor and that others should submit to them. We must read these passages to the brothers again and again. We should let them know that there is authority in the church, and that we should obey and honor such authority.</p><h2 class="head2">Other Points</h2><p>A brother, who was a stone mason, once stood up in a meeting and asked everyone to read John 17. He did this because he liked John 17. As soon as he said this, George Muller stood up and said, "I can read this for everybody." When he said this, everyone stopped. Although everyone can speak in a meeting, not everyone who speaks can edify others.</p><p>The principle of prophesying is to speak that which touches one's inner being. Moreover, the words spoken must be for the building up of others. The principle of tongue-speaking is speaking when one is touched, yet not edifying others with such speaking. If a man is touched in his own heart, he is acting in the principle of speaking in tongues if his word does not touch others. The word in 1 Corinthians 14:2-19 is very important. It says that if a man is touched by anything, what he is touched by must also touch others. Only then can he speak in the meeting because only then will his word build up the church. If something does not build up others, one should not speak. This is the basic principle of speaking in the meetings.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
