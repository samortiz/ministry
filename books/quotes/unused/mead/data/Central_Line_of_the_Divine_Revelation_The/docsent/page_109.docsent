   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>that We May Become a New Lump</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We enjoy Christ also by partaking of Christ as the Lamb of the Passover and the unleavened bread that we may become a new lump 1 Cor 5:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Passover lamb was for redemption and initial feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Israelites took the lamb, slew it, shed its blood, and cut the meat of the lamb into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blood of the lamb was for the redemption of the Israelites, and the meat of the lamb was their food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the Passover, they had to immediately walk out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to walk out of Egypt they needed strength, and their eating of the lamb supplied them with the needed strength.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Passover lamb was eaten with unleavened bread Exo 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to their constitution, the children of Israel were completely leavened; that is, they were constituted sinners Rom 5:19a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after their eating of the Passover lamb with the unleavened bread, they were cleansed and began to have an unleavened constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This change in constitution came about because of the change in their diet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the time of our regeneration we began to have a new constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ as the unleavened bread became our unleavened food to reconstitute us, so that we may become a new lump.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before regeneration, we were the old lump, full of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But now we have become a new lump, because we are becoming unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This new lump is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Leviticus 23 two loaves of bread baked with leaven were presented to the Lord on the day of Pentecost vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two loaves signify the church in two sections, one section being of the Jews, represented by the Jews at Pentecost Acts 2:1-4 , and the other section being of the Gentiles, represented by the house of Cornelius 10:24, 44 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The two loaves included leaven because both the Jewish and Gentile believers still have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By eating Christ as the unleavened bread, we become unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must eat Christ as the Lamb and as the unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the Lamb He is for our strengthening and support.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the unleavened bread He causes us to be unleavened constitutionally, making us a new lump.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By Being Joined to the Lord as One Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We enjoy Christ also by being joined to the Lord as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First Corinthians 6:17 is one of the highest verses in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we as fallen human beings can become one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although this may seem difficult to believe, it is nevertheless a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because Paul wrote such a word in his Epistle, we must believe that we are one spirit with the Lord, who is the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound, indwelling, processed, and consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because we are one spirit with Him, we experience His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the way to enjoy Christ.</S>
