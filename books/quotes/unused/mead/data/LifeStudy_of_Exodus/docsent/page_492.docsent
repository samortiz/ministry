   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE URGENT NEED OF MATURITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As God s chosen people, we all have been redeemed, no matter what our age may be, spiritually speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we need to ask ourselves what our spiritual age is according to our maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps your spiritual age is only a few weeks or a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The total number of the children of Israel at the time of Exodus 30 was at least two million.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But less than a third, 603,550 to be exact, were qualified to be in God s army.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>More than two-thirds of God s people, all the females and the males under the age of twenty, could not be numbered in this military census.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The spiritual significance of this is that if we would be in the army to fight for God s move, we need to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to grow until we come to the spiritual age of twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The intercession offered at the incense altar is for this growth and maturity so that the army can be formed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more intercession there is at the incense altar, the greater will be the urgency for God s people to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>More and more we shall realize that the need for maturity is desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is the urgent need for more of us to grow, reach maturity, and thereby become qualified to be formed into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only when such an army has been formed will God be able to move on earth for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apart from an army formed of mature ones, there is no way for God to move.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oh, God s chosen people need to grow!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The intercessory prayer offered to God at the incense altar is for this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sisters should not be disappointed to hear that only the males among the Israelites could be formed into God s army.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In spiritual experience a male signifies someone who is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today, spiritually speaking, some sisters may be males, whereas some brothers may be females spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether we are spiritually a male or a female does not depend on whether we are brothers or sisters; it depends on whether we are strong in spirit or weak in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are strong in spirit, you are a male.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if you are weak in spirit, you are a female.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Too many among us are females.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, there is the need of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>FIGHTING BY THE PRECIOUS CHRIST IN ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us suppose that you are mature enough to be in God s army.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because your spiritual age is at least twenty years, you are qualified to be numbered among those who are able to go to war.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But does this mean that you should enter directly into the fight?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It certainly does not mean this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you try to fight directly, you will suffer a plague.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Exodus 30:12 says, When you take the sum of the sons of Israel according to those that are numbered of them, then every man shall give a ransom for his soul to Jehovah when you number them, that there be no plague among them when you number them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to avoid any plague, we should never go to war in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should say, In myself I shall never go to fight in God s army.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only in Christ and by Christ shall I go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have Christ as my half-shekel, as my ransom silver.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is precious and valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we would fight in God s army, we must fight only by this precious Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Christ typified by the ransom silver is not the crucified Christ, the Christ who died on the cross as the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, the propitiation silver is a heave offering, and the heave offering signifies the resurrected and ascended Christ, the Christ in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the type of the propitiation silver, the Christ by whom we fight is not the crucified One He is the ascended One.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps you have never considered this matter before, but this is the picture presented by the type.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, from experience we know that whenever we go to war by ourselves and not by Christ as the ransom silver, we suffer a plague.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that in spiritual fighting we have a disaster.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, at least some among us have had the experience of fighting the spiritual warfare not by themselves but by Christ as the ransom silver.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They fight by Christ as the heave offering, as the resurrected and ascended One.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All those who have engaged in spiritual warfare know that this warfare is not fought on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The battles of spiritual warfare are waged in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to fight this kind of battle, we need to be in the heavenlies with the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to be in the heavens with Christ as our heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Elsewhere we have pointed out that the wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ and that the heave offering signifies the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, the heave offering is an advancement beyond the wave offering; that is, the ascended Christ is an advancement over the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In ascension Christ defeats His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the record in Exodus and Numbers, only through a military census can God s army be formed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God has such an army, He is able to move on earth for His interests.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, as we fight in this army for God s move, we must fight by the resurrected and ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should never fight by ourselves.</S>
