   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THYATIRA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following Pergamos, which indicates an illegal marriage of the church to the world, comes Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thyatira signifies the Roman Catholic Church, which is full of all kinds of corrupting leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The idols, the fornication, the evil teachings, and the practices of Jezebel are the leaven within the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the evil woman in Matthew 13 who hid the leaven in three measures of meal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord also issued a call to the overcomers within Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He called them to overcome the fornication, the evil teachings, and all the evil practices.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The lighting of the candles, the burning of the incense, and the worshipping of all the idols in the Roman Catholic Church are a real blasphemy to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some might say that they received help from the Roman Catholic Church and that there have been many dear believers within the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No doubt the Roman Catholic Church is gilded and covered with many precious persons and precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, this is for cheating people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a false front.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The outside of the cup is covered with gold, pearls, and precious stones, but the inside of the cup is full of abominations Rev 17:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all must overcome the abominations the idols, the spiritual fornication, and all kinds of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must hold to what the Lord has shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, the overcomers will rule over the nations during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not All Believers Being Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must see that being a believer is not equal to being an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some Christian teachers have taught that all the real believers in the Lord Jesus will reign as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning this point, I prefer not to answer doctrinally, but experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would like to ask them concerning their own situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do they have the appearance of kings?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is their daily life the living of kings?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have they been disciplined and trained, or are they loose and sloppy?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are they ready to be kings to reign with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I'm afraid when the Lord Jesus comes, they will say, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not ready!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would reign with the Lord Jesus as kings, we need to be trained and strictly disciplined by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The young man who will be the next King of England is daily and constantly under strict training and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This training is so that he will be qualified to be the king.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is learning to look like a king, to talk like a king, and to behave like a king.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How about yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today you gossip, murmur, and are so loose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Are you ready to rule as a king?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are you qualified to be a king?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By this we can see that just to be a believer is not sufficient to be an overcomer and to rule and reign with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must be trained and disciplined by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Otherwise, how can we rule over five cities or ten cities?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Luke 19:17, 19 .</S>
