   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE RECREATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:23; 6:12; 10:31 I. THE PREREQUISITE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The matter of recreation is never a problem to a consecrated person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anyone who is not absolute in his consecration has a problem with recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among God s children, the matter of recreation does not exist to those who are consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to settle the matter of recreation, one must first settle the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as our consecration is not settled, the matter of recreation cannot be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A man who has not settled the matter of consecration may approve what God disapproves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why we must first deal with our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE PURPOSE OF RECREATION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the matter of consecration is settled, we can speak about the purpose of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. For Taking Care of the Family</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We speak about recreation not because of our personal need, but because of the children in our family, that is, our next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Recreation is not a problem at all to those who are consecrated, but there are other people in our family.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have children, and we also have brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they, too, are consecrated, then we will not have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But often they are not consecrated, and our attitude is very much related to them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kind of recreation we allow or do not allow makes a great difference to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We speak of the matter of recreation because we want to lead our family in the proper direction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. For Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes we ourselves also need diversion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To what extent should this diversion be considered proper?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How far can a Christian go?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to see some basic principles before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What kind of recreation should parents permit for their children?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What recreation is considered proper as far as Christians are concerned?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As God s children, we should all be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have a breach in this matter, the world will come into our family.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It will be difficult to drive the world away from our children once it enters our family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to preserve our family for the Lord, we have to pay attention to the matter of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND RECREATION A. Man s Need</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Recreation is scriptural and is compatible with the Lord s will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First of all, we have to acknowledge man s need for recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Christian should not go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man has a need for recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many people are very busy with their schedules.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they do not have some kind of diversion, it is easy for them to become sick; their health can quickly deteriorate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The basic principle of recreation is that it should offer some diversion in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is especially necessary for the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not expect them to study from morning until night.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They must have some kind of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not expect them to do the same thing all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They must have diversions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must be clear first about this underlying principle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord spoke of children playing flutes and dancing in the streets Luke 7:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This dancing is different from the dancing in a ballroom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This dancing and flute-playing are the result of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is nothing wrong with such merry-making.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In fact, there is the need for such things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The basic principle of recreation is diversion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A person has been working for five, six, or eight hours.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has been doing the same thing over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This easily can tire him out.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Doing the same thing over and over again easily strains one s nerves and tires one s body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is the need to have a change, a diversion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This diversion will relieve one s tiredness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A change in work recovers a person from his fatigue.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After a child studies for eight hours in school, he needs to come home to play.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This kind of playing affords him a break from his regular schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, jumping and playing around for eight hours is not a break.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must acknowledge the need for a break and diversion in our lives, but we cannot make recreation our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A man can turn away from his work to something else when he is tired, but he cannot pursue recreation all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some people like to go for a swim in the summer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not see anything wrong with this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is all right to swim for half an hour or an hour when one is tired, but if a person stays in the water all day long like a duck, it is not recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I would like to point out to you that when a man has a problem with recreation, the recreation in itself is not his problem; rather, his problem is with his living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some people charge that Christians have no recreation, but they really do not know what they are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Can something be recreation when one indulges in it all day and all night?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These activities are bondages to a person; they are not recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Strictly speaking, very few people have problems with recreation itself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Most problems come from man s indulgence in recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some people indulge in activities three days and three nights in a row.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Their recreation has become their life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only such people will say that it is difficult being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everyone who has a problem with recreation is an extreme person.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They have made recreation their whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must be clear that man has a need for diversion, but he does not have a need for indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He has a need for respite, but he does not have a need for his whole life to revolve around respite.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All things are lawful, but not all things are expedient.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All things are lawful for us, but we will not be brought under the power of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we indulge in something day and night, it means that we are enslaved by that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is a great mistake to indulge in something this way.</S>
