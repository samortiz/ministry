   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. A Mystical and Spiritual Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Body of Christ is also a mystical and spiritual Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Built Up by Its Particularly Gifted Members</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This mystical and spiritual Body is built up by its particularly gifted members as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, the joints of the rich supply Eph 4:11-12, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are builders of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who are the particularly gifted members of the Body should not regard themselves as different from all the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, in our physical body the nose and the eyes are particularly gifted members, but they are still members of the body, not something else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The principle is the same with the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The particularly gifted members are still nothing more than members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, many of today's ministers and pastors do not regard themselves as members but as "lords."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By the Lord's grace I can testify that no matter how much I speak for God, I always consider myself a brother in the Lord and a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not want others to give me any kind of title, for I am just a member and a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Built Up by Its Each One Part</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mystical and spiritual Body is built up also by its each one part operating according to its measure v. 16 . Instead of being a particularly gifted member of the Body, you may be a common, general member.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is wonderful to be such a member.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The common members are also the builders of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a common member of the Body, you should function according to your measure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By these two kinds of members, the particularly gifted members as the joints of the rich supply and the common members with their measure, the Body is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>D. The Organism of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Body of Christ is also the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An illustration of this organism is found in John 15 the vine with all its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The vine is developed and enlarged through its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This organism grows with the riches of the Triune God and expresses the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a picture of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Consummated by the Growing in the Divine Life of All the Members into the Head</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ is consummated by the growing in the divine life of all the members of the Body into Christ, the Head Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul speaks of growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To grow in this way is to have Christ increase in us in all things until we attain to a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word Head in verse 15 indicates that our growth in life by the increase of Christ should be the growth of the members of the Body under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all need to grow into the Head, Christ, so that the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God may be consummated.</S>
