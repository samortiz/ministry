<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: August 24, 1948<br />Place: Kuling</h1><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A SINNER<br />TO TURN HIS HEART TO THE LORD</h2><h2 class="head2">Paying Attention to What Sinners Should Do</h2><p>The subject of our discussion this time is how the gospel is accomplished in the sinner, rather than how God accomplishes His work through the gospel. Once we are clear how the gospel is accomplished in the sinner, we will know how to preach the gospel. If a sinner has a subjective grasp of how he is saved at the time he receives the gospel, he will know how to convey the same gospel to others. Many times when we preach the gospel, we do not know what sinners need. This is the reason we waste so much time.</p><p>There are two basic truths with regard to preaching the gospel. The first is the work of God which He has accomplished in Christ. God's work in Christ consists of His sending the Lord Jesus to the cross. By shedding His blood and dying on the cross, Christ redeemed us from our sins. God raised up the Lord Jesus because He satisfied God's righteousness. This is a basic truth in the gospel of God. Of course, this is a very important truth, but as far as the sinner is concerned, this truth is a past act. A sinner must do something else before he can be saved. Hence, there is a second step: God must send His Spirit to man. God transmits the past work of Christ to us by sending the Holy Spirit. This also is a basic truth of the gospel. If the Spirit does not come, we cannot be saved even though the Lord Jesus has accomplished redemption and God is ready to receive us. Without the Holy Spirit, the work of the Lord Jesus is objective; it cannot be subjective to us. It is outside of us; it cannot be ours inwardly. It belongs to God alone and cannot be ours as well. The coming of the Holy Spirit applies Christ's accomplished work to us. The question now is: What should the sinner do? The Lord Jesus has finished His work, and the Holy Spirit is waiting to operate in the sinner. How then can the sinner be saved? Among gospel preachers, some emphasize repentance, while others emphasize faith. Still others emphasize confession. What should a sinner do before he can be saved? This is what we have to find out today.</p><p>Gospel preachers today are subconsciously affected by their own theology in their preaching. They lay up in store three things for the sinners. The first is a collection of gospel truths. The second is a mixture of exhortations on the vanity of the world and the evil of sins, etc. The third is some demand for actions, such as repentance, confession, prayer, believing, or baptism. Most gospel preachers today are well equipped in these few categories of things. This is their basic arsenal. They first try to help people to understand a collection of gospel truths. Then they lead them to take some action, thinking that a man will be saved by taking these actions. But is this practice biblical at all? What does the Bible teach concerning the preaching of the gospel? We have to point out a few examples from the Bible. In the New Testament, we find many people believing in the Lord and being saved; we find this in the Gospels and in Acts. But how did the Lord Jesus and the apostles lead these ones to salvation? From their pattern, we can learn how we should preach the gospel to sinners, and how wrong our ways are today.</p>
