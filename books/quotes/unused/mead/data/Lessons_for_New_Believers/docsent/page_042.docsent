   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the activities in the meeting, there is also speaking in addition to selecting hymns and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speaking includes testifying, exhorting, and releasing the light we have received from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In principle, the points that apply to selecting hymns and praying also apply to speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matching the Nature of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we speak in a meeting, we should follow the nature of the meeting; otherwise, our speaking can interrupt the atmosphere and even kill the spirit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matching the Progression of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our speaking in a meeting must match the progression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our speaking we must take care of this point.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Being according to the Sense in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although our speaking must also follow the nature and take care of the progression of a meeting, we must speak according to the sense in our spirit, not merely according to dead knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Bible Reading Being Brief and Fitting</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is a need to read a portion from the Bible, only the verses that are appropriate should be read.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Reading an entire chapter or a few chapters can be as unbearable as long prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By reading only succinct portions, we can save time and not consume people s energy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our Bible reading needs to be brief.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being Brief, Succinct, and Focused</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When speaking in a meeting, we need to be brief, succinct, and focused.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When some brothers stand up to speak, they speak about everything from atomic bombs to missiles, changing subjects without any inward restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Speaking in an unfocused way disturbs the meeting and must be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not Being Afraid</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not be too bold and arrogant, nor should we be afraid when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be calm, not nervous, anxious, timid, or frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being frightened and nervous can weaken the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Using a Clear Voice</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should also pay attention to our voice when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our voice must be clear and audible so that it can easily be heard and understood by everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A soft and muffled voice is not only difficult to understand, but it can also cause the atmosphere of the meeting to sink.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Using an Exercised and Released Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The most important point related to speaking is to exercise our spirit so that it can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not be like a robot, speaking only from our throat and mind but not from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our spirit is released when our whole being is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once the spirit comes out, we will have a feeling when we open our mouth to speak, and when people hear us, they will be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This requires much practice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Considering the Feeling and Response of Others</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must also consider the feeling and response of others when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we continue speaking, even though some saints have fallen asleep during our speaking, we disregard the response of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the saints fall asleep when we are speaking, we can either stop speaking and immediately sit down, or we can change our manner of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This requires our attention and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Taking Care of the Time</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must also take care of the time when we speak in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not speak for half an hour or an hour as it pleases us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must take care of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Avoiding Two Things Pretense</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There should not be pretense in the activities in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, it is pretentious to cry when we have no feeling to cry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To pretend in a meeting is very ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the activities in a meeting must be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Imitation</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not imitate the behavior of other people in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>More than a decade ago, a group of young sisters in Tsingtao tried to imitate an elderly sister who often coughed when speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These young sisters imitated her coughing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This imitation made people very uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Imitation, however, may not be intentional.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is unavoidable to be influenced by other people after being with them for a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, the brothers and sisters who meet with us pray in a tone that is completely different from believers in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is an understandable influence, not an imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to be careful not to imitate others intentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All our activity in a meeting must be genuine.</S>
