   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 63 Date:September 22, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER G. R.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was young I became sick and sought for healing from the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After I became well, I was given to one idol to be its adopted son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later I learned the trade of dressmaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I became tired of life and considered becoming a monk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I saw many nominal Christians whose walk did not deserve their name, and I despised Christianity, refusing to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our entire family worshipped idols.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When my first two sons became ill, I prayed to the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But both of them died.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I became angry with the idols and gave them up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I burned all the images and things related to the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once I went to a gospel meeting and heard that there is God and that man has a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I accepted the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Japanese invaded China, I moved inland.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once, I received the promise of Psalm 91.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Spiritual Understanding Not Yet Opened</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You should ask why your spirit is so weak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have experienced many things but have learned few lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You are still very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must not only find the reason for your weakness but the way of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you remain self-assured, self-justifying, and hard, your experience will not result in God's breaking, and you will not receive any good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps you are unable to have much spiritual knowledge and understanding and are unable to take advantage of your environment because of the lack of supply from the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In all your experiences in your environment, you only found yourself related to the things themselves, not to the God who ordered the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason all of your experiences have flown away one by one in a meaningless fashion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those whose spiritual understanding is opened will reap spiritual result in everything they encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lack of Supply</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>from the Ministry of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our brother's experiences are merely outward events to him; they have not become spiritual lessons to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a man's spiritual understanding is enlightened, he may not know what an event means at the time it happens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After a while, however, he will know that God's hand is behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The problem with our brother is that he is short of the supply of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has encountered many things, but he remains weak and has not learned many spiritual lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can see that the ministry of the word is very much related to the way a man runs the race.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man has spiritual understanding, he can turn worldly things into spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to understand the discipline of the Holy Spirit, a man first must have spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only then can he be brought into the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that from now on our brother will see God's mighty hand in everything great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that he will not oppose the Lord but submit to Him instead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once he submits, his spiritual understanding will be enlightened, and his spirit will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our brother must also learn to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As soon as our spiritual understanding is enlightened, our experiences will turn into spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, we will waste our experiences and live our life in vain.</S>
