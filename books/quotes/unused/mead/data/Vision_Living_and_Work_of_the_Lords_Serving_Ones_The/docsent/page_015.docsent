   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SHEPHERDING NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning shepherding new believers to live the Christian life, in chapter 1 we spoke about praying, reading the Bible, meeting, preaching the gospel, fellowshipping with the Lord, consecration, walking according to the spirit, and knowing the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition to these items we should lead the new ones to experience Christ as life, that is, to know that Christ is their life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is to lead them to have a practical Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the most important and central matter in our shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The center of the Christian life is in the experience of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Knowing That We Are Regenerated</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to experience Christ as life, we need to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person who is not regenerated cannot experience Christ, because he does not have Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we are regenerated, the Spirit of God brings Christ into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, as soon as we are regenerated, the Holy Spirit enters into us and imparts the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This life is the life of God, that is, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, Colossians 3:4 says, Christ our life, and Galatians 2:20 says, It is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These two verses are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we shepherd new believers, we must open the Bible and ask them to read these two verses, showing them that Christ lives in us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can even take them a step further and tell them that John 3:36 says, He who believes into the Son has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This eternal life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son in this verse is the Lord Jesus, and to believe into Him means to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we believe into the Son, we receive the Lord into us and thereby have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Theory or philosophy cannot give us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only the Lord Jesus in His salvation can be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Knowing That Christ as the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is in Us to Be Our Life</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must help the new believers see that Christ is not only on the throne, but He is also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the heavenly Christ on the throne of God, and He is also the pneumatic Christ in our spirit to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we must point out that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ resurrected from the dead, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He died on the cross, He was the Savior, Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now He is the life-giving Spirit so that when we believe into Him, He can enter into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must help the new believers to see that Christ is the life-giving Spirit to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, it will be difficult to lead them to live Christ, to live in the life of Christ, and to experience Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the greatest shortage among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thousands of believers love the Lord but do not know that the Lord is in them as the Spirit to be their life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, their love for the Lord and their pursuit of the Lord are rather religious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, we should stress the fact of the Lord s being the life-giving Spirit to be our life, and on the other hand, our experience of this must increase and become richer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Knowing That We Have a Regenerated Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>and That We Should Walk according to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we shepherd new believers to experience Christ as life, we also need to tell them that every believer has a regenerated spirit, a spirit that has been enlivened with the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have given many messages concerning this matter, including messages in the Life-studies of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should read these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In particular, we should read the Life-study messages on Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we will be equipped to lead new believers to know, in a brief and concise way, their regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to tell them that man is precious because he has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man has a body without and a spirit within, and in between is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is by the spirit that we contact the Lord Jesus, who is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we want to experience God and take Him as our life, we must be in our spirit and not in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can explain further with an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you argue with someone, you are either in your emotion or in your mind but never in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more you are in your mind, the easier it is for you to become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, anger will erupt from your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, when you want to have an argument or are about to get angry, you should not act according to your mind or your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, you should act according to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Romans 8:4 Paul says that we should walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we are about to become angry, we should immediately turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we are in our spirit, we are not in our mind or in our emotion; we are in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since the Lord is the life-giving Spirit, when we are in our spirit, we experience Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At such a time it is likely that the Spirit will lead us to stop arguing and to go to our room to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The sisters should have this kind of experience when they go shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They must follow the Spirit and walk according to the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is to take the Lord Jesus as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They should always fellowship with the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In particular, they should pray-read the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Pray-reading the Word will help them to turn away from so many people, things, and matters that are outside the Lord and to turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way their thoughts, behavior, and chores will be done from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is to take the Lord as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is also to experience Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to stress this point again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In his Epistles Paul speaks thoroughly concerning this point.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Galatians 2:20 he says that Christ lives in us, and in verse 19 of chapter 4 he says that Christ is being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Philippians 3:9 Paul tells us to live so that we may be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul also says that Christ should be magnified in us so that we can say, To me, to live is Christ 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To experience Christ in this way is to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not have to focus on doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As long as we live Christ, we are doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Furthermore, we will be sanctified, overcoming, spiritual, and one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thus, we will remain in the church, participate in the church life, and live in the Body, coordinating and serving in harmony with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Experiencing Christ as life is the foundation not only of our spiritual life but also of our coordination and service in the church.</S>
