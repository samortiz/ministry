<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei and Hong Kong on October 15 through 17, 1979. These messages were originally published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> in 1980.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PICTURE VERSUS REALITY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:9; 6:4; 7:6; 8:2, 4; 12:11; John 5:39-40</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE OLD TESTAMENT BEING A PICTURE</h2>
<p>The Old Testament is full of types and figures, pictures given to man from God. In the New Testament God spoke to man in plain words. The Jews, however, did not understand that the Old Testament was merely a picture needing the plain words of the New Testament to bring in the reality of the picture. The Jews have the picture and want only the Old Testament; they do not have the plain words, nor do they want the New Testament. This desire for the Old Testament became a problem to the Jews because they have an empty picture lacking reality, a picture that gradually became ordinances. The many items in the Old Testament picture portray the facts in the New Testament, but each item has become an ordinance because it lacks plain words to bring in reality.</p>
<p>Each ordinance in the Bible is a brush stroke in the picture. When man has the reality that comes with plain words, the brush strokes are not ordinances. Without the reality that comes with plain words, every brush stroke in the picture is an ordinance that man sees and keeps. A picture of an ear is not a real ear, a picture of a nose is not a real nose, and pictures of two eyes and two arms are not real eyes or real arms. Every brush stroke is empty and dead if the picture lacks reality and life. Therefore, without the reality brought forth by the New Testament, the entire Old Testament is empty and dead, because without reality, life, and the Spirit it is a picture of ordinances.</p>
<p>John 5:39 and 40 show this principle. In verse 39 the Lord said to the Jews, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life.&rdquo; The Jews thought, or believed, that the Scriptures contained eternal life. Although such a thought is right, it is also wrong. The Scriptures contain pictures of life but not the reality of life. Hence, the Lord Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;It is these that testify concerning Me.&rdquo; The word <em>testify</em> can be understood as &ldquo;portray.&rdquo; Hence, the Lord seemed to say, &ldquo;It is these that portray Me.&rdquo; In verse 40 the Lord continued, &ldquo;Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.&rdquo; The Jews searched the Scriptures, thinking that the Scriptures contained eternal life; however, the Scriptures were but a portrayal of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord wanted the Jews to come to Him for life. <em>Scriptures</em> in verse 39 refers to the Old Testament, and <em>come to Me</em> in verse 40 refers to the New Testament. The New Testament is Christ. People search the Scriptures, believing that the Scriptures contain eternal life. There is eternal life in the Scriptures, because the Scriptures portray, describe, and testify concerning the Lord. However, if we search the Scriptures but do not come to the Lord, we will obtain only the picture; we will not obtain the reality of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POSSIBILITY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
ALSO BEING A PICTURE</h2>
<p>We must see a principle: the Old Testament is a portrayal, a picture, of Christ, and the New Testament can also become a portrayal, a picture, of Christ without the reality of life. It is possible for us to make the mistake of the Jews by searching the Scriptures but not being willing to come to the Lord in order to have life. To search the Scriptures is to open the Scriptures, to read them with our eyes, to apprehend them with our mind, and to admire them with our heart. This is right, good, and proper. However, if we stop with mere understanding and do not come to the Lord to have life, we will be one step short.</p>
<p>Since 1966 the Lord has been impressing us with the need to pray-read the Word. If we only read, think, understand, and apprehend when coming to the Word, then we will obtain only the picture. We need to pray-read so that in addition to reading with our eyes and apprehending with our mind, we also come to the Lord with our spirit and touch Him with our spirit.</p>
<p>A person may study and understand electricity, but unless he connects an electrical appliance to a power source and switches on the appliance, he will not have electricity. He may research books on electricity, but unless he is willing to receive electricity, he will not have electricity. Although the Bible speaks of life and explains life, we must come to Christ in order to have life.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus spoke this word to the Jewish religionists. It should have been easy for the Jews to come to the Lord. They should have said, &ldquo;Lord, now we understand. The Old Testament is but a picture; You are the reality of the Old Testament. We do not want to know only the picture; we want to worship You. You are the Lord, and You are God. We want to be like Peter, John, and Andrew to contact You, follow You, and walk with You.&rdquo; Actually, Peter and John followed the Lord for three and a half years, but they did not have life during that time, because the Lord had not yet entered into them. Peter and John followed the Lord for three and a half years, but even what they had was only a picture, a portrait. Their walk with the Lord was an outward imitation. When the Lord went up to the mountain, they also went up. Nonetheless, no matter what they did with the Lord Jesus, He had not entered into them. The Lord was the Lord, and they were they. The Lord had not yet become their life.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING REALITY BY RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Even though the disciples followed the Lord for three and a half years, they still had only a picture. One day the Lord said to them, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality;...but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you...Because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (John 14:16-17, 19-20). The Lord was going to accomplish something that would benefit the disciples. He was going to die, resurrect, and come in another form so that He would not be merely in the midst of the disciples; He would be able to enter into them. In that day the disciples would know that the Lord was in them and they were in the Lord, that the Lord lived and hence they lived, and that the Lord lived in them and they lived in the Lord. Then they would no longer have a picture; they would have reality.</p>
<p>On the night of His resurrection the Lord Jesus came into the midst of the disciples. This was a unique appearing. On the one hand, the disciples could see and even touch the Lord (20:20). On the other hand, His coming was the coming of the Spirit. The disciples were in a room with shut doors; nevertheless, the Lord was able to enter (v. 19). Previously, if the doors of the room had been shut, no one but the invisible Spirit could have entered, but the Lord was not limited by the doors, even though He could be seen and touched by the disciples. Science cannot explain this. The doors were shut, but the Lord could enter freely with a physical body for His disciples to see His hands and His side. This is wonderful.</p>
<p>After His resurrection the Lord came as the life-giving Spirit, breathed into the disciples, and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). This word is much greater than Genesis 1:1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; The Jews regard this opening word of the Scriptures as the greatest word in the universe. However, to the believers, the greatest word is John 20:22: &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This word is great because the Lord of creation entered into the man whom He had created. The creation of man is a great thing, but God&rsquo;s breathing Himself into man is even greater.</p>
<p>In creation God formed man from the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). Had God not breathed the breath of life into that lump of dust, the lump of dust would not have had much meaning. Therefore, the important thing in God&rsquo;s creation of man was His breathing into man&rsquo;s nostrils the breath of life in order to bring man to life. However, the creation of man is just a picture. The reality of this picture is with the Lord Jesus on the night of His resurrection when He entered into the disciples, the many lumps of dust. All the disciples were dust, but the Lord Jesus breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This word is great because it concerns reality.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the ultimate manifestation of the Triune God. The Triune God has passed through incarnation, earthly living for thirty-three and a half years, death, resurrection, ascension, and descension to be ultimately manifested as the Spirit. This ultimate manifestation is for God to enter into man. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you&rdquo; (John 16:7). Now that the Spirit has come, the Lord can enter into man. The coming of the Spirit is God mingling with man&mdash;the picture becoming reality. Thus, the coming of the Spirit enables man to have everything required by the Ten Commandments: love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The reality portrayed in every item in the Old Testament is in this Spirit.</p>
<p>The Triune God has passed through many processes. He created, He was incarnated as the man Jesus Christ, and He went through thirty-three and a half years of human living. He ministered for three and a half years and then went to the cross in order to enter into death. He stayed in death for three days to taste death, subdue death, and overcome death. Then He came out of death in resurrection. Every experience was a process that the Triune God has gone through to become the Spirit. For example, a watermelon in the kitchen passes through the processes of being cut, juiced, and poured into cups as delicious watermelon juice. The watermelon juice is the processed watermelon. Without being processed, a watermelon cannot be available or easily received. The Triune God has passed through many processes to become the Spirit. Therefore, on the night of His resurrection the Lord came to breathe into His disciples, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In this step God and man were joined as one.</p><h2 class="head1">METHODS AND TEACHINGS BEING REGULATIONS WITHOUT THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Without the Spirit&rsquo;s entering into us, any method or teaching is an empty and dead regulation. Thirty years ago in Chefoo some sisters who loved the Lord read <em>Sweet Smelling Myrrh,</em> an autobiography of Madame Guyon, and wanted to be like her. Some of them learned to do things slowly, such as walking, sitting down, and talking. Some brothers also followed them. Their laborious and poor imitation was only a picture.</p>
<p>Some people say that the book <em>The Imitation of Christ</em> by Thomas &#224; Kempis is helpful. However, an imitation of Christ is an imitation; seventy percent of this book consists of human effort. The Lord said, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures...Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life&rdquo; (John 5:39-40). If man only imitates and does not contact Christ, the writings of Madame Guyon and Thomas &#224; Kempis or even the Bible will not help.</p>
<p>For many years I wondered why the words of the Bible often seem ineffective. The prophecies of the Bible were effective and fulfilled in history, but most of the words concerning sanctification and overcoming sin seem to be ineffective. For example, the Bible says, &ldquo;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:17). However, in our experience there are not too many days in which the old creation has passed away and everything has become new. The seeming ineffectiveness of the Bible was puzzling to me. This &ldquo;ineffectiveness,&rdquo; however, was not related to the Bible itself but to my receiving of the Bible as regulations.</p>
<p>From a young age I have loved to read the Bible and spiritual publications. I did my best to buy and read every good spiritual publication, such as publications on how to pray and how to be holy. Even though I thought that these publications were quite good, what I learned was ineffective after several days. The Bible says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). About three months after I was saved, I read a spiritual publication on our co-crucifixion with Christ, but I could not die. Therefore, I read more publications until I read an article by Brother Nee. At that time, Brother Nee and other believers said that we must &ldquo;reckon&rdquo; ourselves to be dead (Rom. 6:11). Brother Nee even translated into Chinese a hymn by A. B. Simpson: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little word that the Lord has giv&rsquo;n... / Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin... / Let us reckon... / Let us reckon, rather than feel; / Let us be true to the reck&rsquo;ning, / And He will make it real&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #692). According to this article, I reckoned for a long time without any result. This shows that methods do not work. Methods can be compared to pictures. Even the reckoning taught by A. B. Simpson is a picture.</p>
<p>The content of the Bible is just a picture, but the Triune God has passed through many processes to become the Spirit. When the Spirit comes, there is reality. Without the Spirit everything is a picture with no reality. In some trainings in 1953 and 1954 I spoke on many topics concerning the spiritual life. Afterward, we published two books, <em>The Knowledge of Life</em> and <em>The Experience of Life.</em> Many saints treasure these two books; however, if we live according to these two books without contacting the Spirit, we will still have only a picture. Understanding the Bible is not life. Imitating Madame Guyon is not life. Closely following the book <em>The Experience of Life</em> is not life. Life is the Spirit; hence, we must touch, contact, the Spirit. Theory, doctrines, and pictures cannot replace the Spirit.</p>
<p>We cannot boast of seniority in spiritual matters. I cannot say that because I have seventy-five years of breathing experience, I can therefore take a break from breathing. No one can take a break from breathing. In regard to breathing, a seventy-five-year-old man is like a newborn babe; if he does not breathe, he will expire. An elderly, experienced man and a newborn babe must breathe, that is, contact fresh air with their breathing organ; otherwise, they will not have life. This also applies to exercising our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVERS SELDOM LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We had a problem in the United States that affected some people. Later the Lord showed me the cause of the problem. The Lord told me, &ldquo;You have the Word, but you do not have Me. You have light, but you do not have the Spirit. You have revelation, but you do not have life.&rdquo; We may defend ourselves and say that we are living. However, we may merely have a way of being living to which we are accustomed. In the church we have a set way of having the church life, but this way is not the living out of life. In the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not go to movie theaters, yet we do not live in the spirit and contact the Lord every moment to be one spirit with the Lord. </p>
<p>We may say that the Lord is our life, but we are probably far away from life for twenty-two hours every day. There are twenty-four hours in a day. If we subtract eight hours for sleep, we have sixteen hours. We would be top Christians if we would live in the Lord and be one with Him for one and a half hours out of the sixteen hours. The saints in the churches love the Lord and have a pure heart to pursue Him. But we must ask ourselves, How often are we joined to the Lord as one spirit in our eating, grooming, speaking, interacting with others, and handling of our affairs? Based on my calculation, we should bow our heads and say, &ldquo;Lord, our church life is but a routine; it is a picture without reality.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">WITHOUT THE SPIRIT,<br />
THE CHURCH LIFE ALSO BEING A WAY</h2>
<p>We have been meeting in the church for many years. After so many years our meetings have unexpectedly molded us into our current condition. Because we love the Lord and the church, we do not touch anything that would displease the Lord. However, our not touching things that would displease the Lord is just a way; it is not life. A picture does not have life.</p>
<p>A Chinese Christian once told me that American women always wear lipstick. The Lord has gained many Americans who love Him with a pure heart. The sisters who entered into the church life were touched by the Lord and do not wear lipstick or makeup. Although this is pleasing to the Lord, it is not the Lord Himself. It is one thing to love the Lord and another to live the Lord out. The Lord is pleased when a person loves Him and therefore does not go to movie theaters, does not wear lipstick, and does not care for fashion; however, these are not the Lord. In principle, this can be compared to Judaism. Those in Judaism fear God; therefore, they do not do certain things. We also do not do certain things because we fear God. Those in Judaism fear God, but they do not have God in their living. It is possible that this is also our condition.</p>
<p>Being scriptural in every aspect of our living does not mean that we are full of God. Being scriptural in our living is but a picture. God is Spirit; hence, our living should not be merely a way. We do not want a picture; we want the reality. We do not want a way; we want the reality. The reality is the Triune God, who has gone through various processes to become the life-giving Spirit so that we may be joined to Him as one spirit, contacting Him every moment and not being separated from Him. The Lord is our life. This speaks of our being inseparable from Him. Our relationship with the Lord is a relationship of life. We cannot be separated from our life; the moment that we are separated, we will die. The Lord is our life, and we are His living. Whenever we do not contact Him, everything becomes religion and rituals.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SELF-CONTROL NOT BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Chinese highly regard self-control. Elderly people experience many hardships and have developed self-control so that they do not lose their temper often. Because we have been meeting in the church for a while, we too have developed self-control. However, self-control is not Christ. The church is the best furnace for refining people, but no matter how much we are refined, refining is not Christ. I am afraid that the lessons of the cross that we have learned were lessons of self-control. Forty years ago I did not have that much self-control, but I now have much self-control. After learning lessons of the cross for many years, my sharp &ldquo;edges&rdquo; have been &ldquo;smoothed out&rdquo;; that is, my habits of losing my temper and of being anxious have been dealt with significantly. However, this may only be asceticism, not Christ. Christ is the Spirit; hence, I do not need self-control if I have Christ, if I am joined to Him as one spirit, and if I live in the Spirit. The word <em>self-control</em> is not in our spiritual dictionary. In other words, we should not have self-cultivation.</p>
<p>Paul wrote the Epistle to the Colossians because the Jewish religion and Greek culture converged in Colossae and had entered into the church life to replace Christ. Therefore, the Epistle to the Colossians deals with culture, because culture is a replacement of Christ. Even the way we have our church life is a culture. We are very cultured people, but culture is not Christ. Culture is an enemy of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR WALK NEEDING TO BE ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christ is the Spirit (John 14:17-18). The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The Lord Spirit is with our spirit (v. 18; 2 Tim. 4:22). We have been crucified, buried, and raised together with Him so that we might walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:4). This is our living. Concerning our service, Romans 7:6 says that we &ldquo;serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&rdquo; Anything without the spirit is letter. The spirit is of the new man, but the letter is of the old man. The letter imitates and follows the old, but the spirit is new every day. Our living should be in newness of life, and our service should be in newness of spirit. The Bible does not ask us to walk according to teachings rather than the flesh but to walk according to the spirit (8:4). To be according to the spirit is to be in spirit and to be one spirit with the Lord in our speaking, handling of affairs, and interaction with others. In other words, when our union with the Lord as the Spirit of life is uninterrupted, we will be able to live out the life of the Lord. Then our living will not be a way but a living out of the life within us. Such should be our living and our service.</p>
<p>God does not want us to do things, nor does He want us to serve in a particular way. God wants to be lived out of us. A real tiger lives out the tiger life. The Bible is not for us to imitate but for us to see whether we are living the life of God. Whatever we do according to the picture is not real. A real Christian lives out Christ. It is one thing to be scriptural and another to live out Christ. Being scriptural is different from living out Christ.</p>
<p>The saints in the church life have been &ldquo;drawing pictures&rdquo; for a long time; therefore, our pictures resemble the real thing. The young brothers give strong messages, but these messages are pictures, because the brothers do not live out Christ most of the time. The messages are pictures of Christ that resemble Christ, but a picture that resembles Christ is still not Christ. The brothers need to live out Christ. To live out Christ is not doctrine, nor is it messages. To live out Christ is to be one spirit with the Lord. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Our walk needs to be according to the spirit. The Lord is the all-inclusive Spirit who is with our spirit. Hence, we need to live out the Spirit. If we have the spiritual key and know how to set our mind on the spirit, turn our whole being back to the spirit, and speak and walk in the spirit, Christ will come forth from within us in every situation. There is another realm in the spirit. Only what is lived out from our spirit is Christ. If the brothers would live in the spirit, their messages would no longer be pictures of Christ but would rather supply Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD WANTING CHRIST TO BE LIVED OUT OF US</h2>
<p>God does not want ways; He wants to be lived out of us. He is not concerned about whether we lose our temper, nor is He concerned about whether the sisters wear lipstick. He wants nothing but Christ lived out of us. Then what we do will be because Christ lives in us, not because of regulations; thus, for us to live will be Christ. A real tiger will always look like a tiger. Similarly, what Christ lives out of us will always match the picture portrayed by the Bible, for the Bible is the right picture.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find a person who has a living that matches the picture in the Bible, because our transformation is not complete. We may not do certain things, but we often still live by our natural man. We love or hate, we are proud or humble, and we are angry or meek in our natural man. Some saints, who have been broken by the cross, are still very natural; their living is not necessarily Christ.</p>
<p>Many criminals were crucified during the Roman Empire, but Christ was crucified so that the effectiveness of the cross could be applied in our spirit in order for us to live Christ by the divine life. Only that which is lived out of our spirit is Christ. We certainly need to be broken in order for Christ to be lived out of us, but the breaking of the cross is one thing and the living out of Christ is another. It is possible for a person to be broken by the cross but to not live out Christ. Living out Christ is a matter of resurrection and of the spirit; it is not a matter of only the cross.</p>
<p>We should not focus on methods, because only that which comes out of the spirit is Christ. We need the Lord&rsquo;s grace in order to see that without contacting Christ, even reading the whole Bible will not benefit us. For this reason the Lord said that some searched the Scriptures, but they were not willing to come to Him to have life. This means that searching the Scriptures cannot replace our coming to the Lord. I encourage all the saints to search the Scriptures, but we must learn to come to the Lord.</p>
<p>Unlike Peter and John in the four Gospels, we cannot see the Lord face to face. Today we come to the Lord in spirit. We are joined to the Lord as one spirit, one life. He is the vine, and we are the branches (John 15:5). He and we have the same life. Christ is our life, and He abides in us and lets us abide in Him. Now we are one life, one spirit, with Christ.</p>
<p>From our experience we know that only one thing counts before the Lord: to be joined to the Lord as one spirit, to live in the spirit, and to walk according to the spirit. This does not mean that we should not do anything when we live in the spirit, for that would be to be &ldquo;dead&rdquo; in spirit. We still need to live, to move, and to serve, but everything must be in spirit. This requires our practice. It is not enough to shout about releasing the spirit in the meetings. We must live in the spirit and do all things, whether great or small, in the spirit in our daily life. We must abide in the Lord and let Him abide in us. He is our life, and we are His living. To live out Christ is a matter of the spirit and of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">DRAWING A PICTURE VERSUS<br />
LIVING A REALITY</h1>
<p>Christian knowledge concerning the Holy Spirit has advanced gradually through the ages to what the Lord has shown us in these years. In the nineteenth century the Brethren saw some light concerning the Spirit, but the light that they saw cannot compare to what we have seen. The light that we have seen is very clear.</p>
<p>The Lord has shown us that He wants to gain the church as His expression. God created man in His image and according to His likeness so that man could express Him. God wants to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that He and man may be joined as one in life. Then God will be the life and content of a group of people, and they will be His expression. We know this truth, and we can speak it. If we liken this truth to a tiger, then every one of us is able to draw a realistic picture of a tiger.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PICTURE IN THE BIBLE NEEDING<br />
THE SPIRIT FOR REALITY</h2>
<p>We should not despise pictures, because the Old Testament is a picture. However, the reality of the Old Testament pictures is with the Spirit. With the Spirit the pictures in the Bible have reality and life, but without the Spirit the pictures are empty and dead letter. We are clear that the Spirit is God. To have the Bible without the Spirit is to have the picture without life. Hence, even though we speak the truths in the Bible and have seen much light, without the Spirit we have mere doctrine, a picture, and in principle we are no different from the Old Testament. Since the time of the apostles, countless spiritual men have touched the Spirit and have written about what they touched for later generations to read and experience. Without the Spirit, these spiritual men would have merely &ldquo;drawn pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the past we made the grave mistake of regarding the Old Testament and the New Testament as merely pictures. We must admit that we also regarded the truth and spiritual literature as pictures. Ninety-five percent of our reading of the Old Testament, the New Testament, and various spiritual publications has been a picture because we may have touched the Spirit in only five percent of our reading. Regrettably, instead of touching the Spirit, we received doctrines, testimonies, knowledge, methods, and practices. Hence, all these have become pictures.</p>
<p>We probably pay more attention to the Spirit than other Christian groups do. However, we have the Spirit five percent of the time, and the remaining ninety-five percent of the time we mainly have doctrines from the Bible, from the truths we have received from the Lord, and from spiritual practices. The Lord said, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life&rdquo; (John 5:39-40). This word clearly shows that it is one thing to search the Scriptures and another to come to the Lord and receive life. If our reading of the Bible can be unrelated to life, then our reading of other spiritual publications can be as well.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TURNING FROM DOCTRINE TO REALITY</h2>
<p>We are skillful in our &ldquo;drawings.&rdquo; The trainings in Taiwan began in 1952, and we held numerous trainings in 1953 and 1954. These trainings brought in considerable blessings. However, we spent ninety-five percent of our time &ldquo;drawing pictures.&rdquo; It would be marvelous if ninety-five percent of our living, our work, and the testimony of the church were in the Spirit. However, perhaps less than five percent of our living, work, and testimony were of the Spirit. Everything we did was mainly related to &ldquo;drawing a picture&rdquo; because it was without the Spirit.</p>
<p>In 1958 we began to speak of eating the Lord, drinking the Lord, and enjoying the Lord, because we felt the futility of doctrine, knowledge, and philosophy. The Lord is the Spirit; hence, we must touch the Spirit. In 1960 we spent the whole year learning to exercise our spirit and to blend in the spirit. The <em>Supplement of Eighty-five Hymns</em> was written in early 1961 in Chinese. Christ, the Spirit, and the church are the three important items in these eighty-five hymns. One of these hymns is &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #499). Everyone liked to sing these hymns, but they merely appreciated the hymns without touching the Spirit. We sang many hymns concerning the Spirit, but I am concerned that we did not touch the Spirit.</p>
<p>After October 1961 I went from Taipei to Manila and then to the United States. I remained in the United States for about a year. In October 1962 the brothers in Taipei wrote to me and asked me to return to Taipei for a conference. However, I was clear within that I should accept the burden to remain in the United States and not return to Taipei. So I cabled the brothers and told them that I could not return to Taipei. Hence, we began the work in the United States at the end of 1962.</p>
<p>The work in the United States began in the Spirit. Therefore, after a short period of time there were obvious results related to exercising the spirit. What we were unable to do in Taiwan in 1960 and 1961, we achieved in the United States. In the United States we emphasized the Spirit more than the truth. Hence, there was the supply of life that brought in the blessing. In 1970 we spontaneously began to migrate. That year there was an international conference in Los Angeles with an attendance of twelve hundred. At that time there were about fifteen hundred people in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States. After the migrations began, we increased to over six thousand in two years, that is, by the end of 1972.</p><h2 class="head1">GIVING THE ENEMY THE GROUND<br />
BY NEGLECTING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>While we strengthened the migration in 1973 and focused on the propagation of the work, we unconsciously neglected and lost the Spirit. Hence, the migrations became a form. Most of what we did in our first ten years in the United States was in the Spirit, but what we did in the four years after 1972 became a form. We had less Spirit and more &ldquo;picture.&rdquo; Because we cared for the propagation of the work, we did not hold to the ground in the Spirit; we wanted to find good places and campuses to propagate the work by gaining people for the Lord. This, however, opened a door to Satan and let some ambitious ones in sheep&rsquo;s clothing sneak in. Although we knew their true condition, we tolerated them for four years because we had unconsciously turned from the Spirit to the propagation of the work; we cared too much for the propagation.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1978, less than three months after returning to the United States from a conference in Taipei, I discovered that someone was rebelling. Initially, I discussed the matter only with my wife and said nothing to others, not even to the co-workers or the elders. The two of us prayed earnestly because the rebellious one had deceived everyone. During our prayer I realized my mistake of not standing firm in the Spirit and not holding firm to life. By turning to the work and to propagation, I had opened a back door for the enemy. I therefore resolved to do nothing but pray. Because some in sheep&rsquo;s clothing had sneaked in while we were neglecting the Spirit and life, we could not use human efforts to cause them to leave; rather, we had to stand in life. Therefore, I began to live in the spirit and in life.</p>
<p>In March, during a conference in Anaheim, I spoke concerning three keys in Matthew 16. From that point, the Lord began to take His recovery back from the hand of those who were plotting a rebellion. I received an invitation to hold a conference on the East Coast during the spring, and I went as planned. I did not know that some rebellious ones were there when I accepted the invitation. By the time I went, the situation was clear. However, while I was there, I gave messages only on life. I did not care for the outward things; I only cared for the matters of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RESTORED TO THE SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>After I returned to Anaheim, there was a conference in the summer that was followed by a training on Ephesians. That training was a great help. The messages on life restored the sense and the sentiment of the saints, turning us from work and propagation back to the Spirit and life. The saints were also clear that certain ones were taking the lead to rebel. Because I had emphasized the Spirit, not outward matters, with the saints, they also exercised to live in the spirit. This is how the rebellious ones were set aside.</p>
<p>After the training on Ephesians, the saints lost interest in the rebellious ones. When the rebellious ones saw that they could do nothing, they no longer wanted to stay.</p>
<p>On August 6 of that year the rebellious ones disrupted the bread-breaking meeting in the church in Anaheim. The next morning three responsible brothers came to see me concerning a rebellious one and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we can no longer tolerate him. He cannot remain in the eldership. We want to have an open talk with him.&rdquo; Because they were firm, I said, &ldquo;Brothers, since you have come to fellowship with me, allow me to say something. I feel that it is best for us not to do anything at present. You are the elders; I am not, so perhaps my feeling does not match yours. But according to my observation, we should not do anything. We should rather let him be.&rdquo; The brothers eventually agreed and also felt it was best not to do anything. Shortly afterward this rebellious one withdrew.</p>
<p>The messages given during the training on Ephesians had such an effect because they were on life. The work of the rebellious ones on the East Coast also reached its peak, and the saints were waiting to hear what I would say. But I did not care about outward matters; I only gave messages on life and focused on the Spirit. As a result, the saints were helped and strengthened. Those messages opened our eyes and made us clear. As a result, the rebellious ones were set aside and could do nothing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE BIBLE BEING<br />
TWO SPIRITS BECOMING ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must understand that without the Spirit, everything we do is just a picture. Some may have problems that need to be solved, but the only solution is the Spirit. The highest point of the Bible is two spirits becoming one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). The Triune God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and has descended as the Spirit. Our former understanding of the Spirit was insufficient. Now we are clear why the Epistles, especially Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, stress the Spirit. The term <em>the Spirit</em> is first used in John 7:39: &ldquo;This [Jesus] said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; The Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, that is, the Triune God.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; This life-giving Spirit is the Spirit. The Spirit possesses both divinity and humanity. The Spirit is the Triune God, who has passed through incarnation to put on humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection in order to bring humanity into divinity in order to become the all-inclusive Spirit. He is our Redeemer, our Savior, and our life. As the Spirit, He has entered into us to be joined with our spirit. Hence, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the apostle John said, &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; (1:10). At the end of the Bible there is a man in his spirit. The Bible produces such a person in the spirit. The New Testament does not tell us to walk according to the commandments, but it does say, &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit&rdquo; (Gal. 5:16). Such a walk includes our living and activities.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN&rsquo;S SECRET BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Because only prayer can keep us in the spirit, the New Testament tells us to unceasingly pray (1 Thes. 5:17). When we do not pray, we are not in the spirit, and when we are not in the spirit, our practice and living are but a picture. Our practice may be &ldquo;realistic,&rdquo; resembling reality, but it is merely a human practice without the spirit. Only that which is lived out of the spirit is real. We should speak to our spouse in the spirit and also buy things in the spirit. The Spirit is all-inclusive. The genuine Christian life and the genuine church life are in the Spirit. The secret to being a Christian is with the spirit.</p>
<p>This generation of young people is more blessed than previous generations, because the light that we now have is clearer. If we are not in the spirit when we speak of being dealt with, obeying our seniors, and having an absolute consecration, then we are merely drawing a picture. The spirit is the reality. Without the spirit, everything is a picture. I was not so clear when I spoke this several years ago, but during the recent turmoil I learned the lesson of doing nothing. The saints in the United States were amazed that I did nothing and said nothing concerning the dissenting ones. But I was clear that by neglecting the Spirit and life, we had opened the door to Satan for the pretenders to cause trouble. I realized that methods are futile and that we had to return to the Spirit and live in life. Thus, we received more light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO LIVE CHRIST</h2>
<p>One day after the training on Ephesians, the Lord rebuked me while I was praying. He asked me how much I lived Christ during the day. I could only confess that I spent too little time living Him. Then I saw that my living was according to the letter of the Bible and according to knowledge and doctrine. I could not say that Christ was my not going to the movie theater and my not loving the world. Buddhist monks are separated from human society and love the world less than we do, but is that Christ? Chinese peasants are not fashionable, but is that Christ? The Lord told me that it is one thing to love Him and another to live Him. We must not only love Christ but also live Him. It is not sufficient to say that we do not watch movies because we love Christ. We still need to live Christ. I should not go to the movies because He is not going to the movies. This light shined brightly in me.</p>
<p>Whether in co-workers&rsquo; meetings, young people&rsquo;s meetings, elders&rsquo; meetings, service meetings, or other meetings, I have only one burden&mdash;to live Christ. This is the only &ldquo;dish&rdquo; that I will serve for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I have no other burden. I only want the saints to live Christ and live in the spirit.</p>
<p>Our way and our ground are right. We are taking the way of the recovery, and we are standing on the proper ground because the Lord wants this way and this ground. If we do not take this way and stand on this ground, the Lord will have no way to go on. However, if we take the right way and stand on the proper ground but do not have the reality of living Christ, we are empty, and the Lord still has no way to go on.</p>
<p>We have experienced many turmoils, but where are the dissenting ones today? What is their condition? They are still Christians, and some may even be working for the Lord, but we must admit that they are scattered and have lost the blessing. They declared that they saw a vision, but they have each gone their own way and are finished. Several have left us, and they ended up with nothing. This proves that our way is right and that our ground also is right.</p>
<p>In the past few decades the Lord has made His intention known to us and has given us more light. It is difficult to find other publications with spiritual weight or of spiritual value. Between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century many weighty, spiritual books were published, but since then almost no publications of spiritual value have been published. The Lord&rsquo;s mercy put us on a way that corresponds to His heart. However, if we merely take the right way and stand on the right ground without the reality of living Christ, we are empty, and the Lord cannot go on.</p>
<p>If we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery do not live Christ, where will the Lord gain a group of people who live Christ? Because the Lord has had mercy on us, we should care for nothing but the spirit. We should drop every problem and take care of the spirit. It is not a matter of right or wrong but of whether we are in the spirit. This is the only standard. We may do everything right and be free of problems, but it will be empty and of no value if we are not in the spirit. At best, our doing and living will be a picture for others to look at.</p><h2 class="head1">DRAWING A PICTURE VERSUS LIVING THE REALITY</h2>
<p>For example, there are two ways for the younger saints to be subject to the older saints. One involves a picture of subjection, and the other way is living the reality of subjection. If I live Christ, how can I not be subject to the older saints? How can I live loosely or indulge the flesh if I am living Christ? However, if I do not indulge in the flesh but also do not live Christ, I am only practicing asceticism, like that of Hinduism. I may have a high morality, but if I do not live Christ, my living is no different from the practices taught by Chinese neo-Confucianists, like Wang Yang-Ming. The Lord wants Christ to be lived out of our spirit. If we would live in our spirit, our problems would be resolved.</p>
<p>There are also two ways for us to keep the ground of oneness. One way is to have a picture based on the doctrinal knowledge of keeping the local ground and not being divided. The other way is by living Christ, for genuine oneness is in Christ. Christ is not divided; if we live Christ, we will not be divided from the saints. Recently, I gave ten messages in Anaheim on the ground of oneness (see the book <em>The Genuine Ground of Oneness</em>). My approach to these ten messages was completely different from the past, but the truth was not different. My former approach was to draw a picture, but this time I asked whether we live Christ. To live Christ is to be one and to be in the oneness. The oneness spoken of in John 17 does not depend on methods but on the oneness in the Triune God. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.&rdquo; If we live in our spirit and live in the Triune God, what we live out will spontaneously be oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must ask whether we are walking according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4). We must be persons who walk according to the spirit. &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; is the solution to everything (Rev. 1:10). For example, if we follow the spirit, we will know whether we should go to Taichung or to Hualien. Our only desire is to be in spirit, because the spirit is the solution to every problem.</p>
<p>If the Lord cannot gain a group of people on the earth who live in the mingled spirit, He will have no way. He does not need a large number of people, but He must gain a people on the earth who not only stand on the recovered ground of the oneness of the church but also live Christ in the human spirit. Otherwise, the Lord has no way. Whether we are taking care of the churches or going out for the propagation, everything that we do in ourselves is merely a work. This work may be on the proper ground, but it is a picture that only looks like reality. Without living Christ, there is no reality in our living.</p>
<p>Some of the local churches are so desolate that they do not even have the picture. But this does not mean that having the picture is equal to having a living. In the past we have paid too much attention to pictures. The Lord wants us to live the reality, but in order to live the reality, we must be in our spirit. Whenever we are not in our spirit, we are only drawing pictures.</p>
<p>We are on the proper ground, but we have been hindered by substitutes. We have the most noble and superior substitutes&mdash;our truth is superior, our doctrines are superior, our light is superior, and even our spiritual cultivation is superior. However, regardless of how superior these things may be, they are not Christ. Nevertheless, we should not say that we do not want a certain positive thing because it is not Christ. Culture is an example. Although culture is not Christ, without culture, including being subject to laws, we would become barbarians. This is not acceptable either.</p>
<p>Some brothers deal with the flesh in fear and trembling and accept the breaking of the cross but do not live Christ. Although this is better than letting the flesh erupt, this &ldquo;better&rdquo; thing will become a substitute for Christ. A person whose flesh erupts can repent and receive the Lord, but a person whose flesh does not erupt often holds on to substitutes. In China it was easy for some of the bandits and robbers and those who led a dissolute life to be saved upon hearing the gospel, but it was not as easy for the well-mannered followers of Confucius and Mencius to be saved upon hearing the gospel. The teachings of Confucius and Mencius are good, and culture is needed in human society, but Christ does not have a way with those who are deeply rooted in culture.</p>
<p>This word is not to encourage us to be barbaric or to be foolish; that would ruin our future. More than fifty years of testing prove that our way and our ground are unshakable. On the one hand, the truth is always victorious. On the other hand, we must live out Christ while taking the way of the truth and standing on this ground of the truth. The Lord does not want godliness or breaking; He wants the release of the Spirit. The exercise of godliness and the breaking of the flesh are helpful, but they are not Christ, nor are they the reality of the Spirit. The younger saints need to see and practice living in the spirit while they are young. The church is built up in our spirit. The younger saints can be subject to the older saints in this spirit. The breaking is also in this spirit. Instead of using our own methods to break ourselves, we should live in the spirit. Then what needs to be broken will be broken.</p>
<p>Hence, we must pray unceasingly. To pray unceasingly is to live in the spirit. In other words, only by praying unceasingly can we live in the spirit, because praying unceasingly is the only way to live in the spirit. If we do not pray, we are not in the spirit, but as soon as we pray, we are in the spirit. Revelation 1:10 says, &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; Hence, whenever we are in our spirit, it is the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Every day should be the Lord&rsquo;s Day, because we should be in our spirit every day. This is to live Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EARNESTLY PRACTICING TO LIVE<br />
IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE FALL<br />
BEING MAN&rsquo;S BASIC PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Man has a problem that originated in the fall. The cause of the fall is that man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil enabled man to act without needing God, apart from God, and separate from God. Man&rsquo;s fall is fully related to this matter. The issue of the fall is that man was enabled to do things by himself, independent from God and without needing God. This issue has become part of our human nature; it is part of our fallen constitution.</p>
<p>God created man as a vessel to receive Him and contain Him. God did not intend for man to do anything by himself or to do anything for God. He did not intend for man to do anything independently, apart from Him, or in isolation from Him. God is the Potter, and we are the clay. God made us as vessels of clay to contain Him. Because God is honorable and glorious, we as His vessels are also honorable and glorious. God had no intention for us to do anything for Him. He created us as vessels so that we would contain Him.</p>
<p>The fall changed man&rsquo;s position from receiving God to doing things for God. God created man as a vessel and placed man in front of the tree of life so that man would receive Him as life and be joined to the life of God. But Satan came and tempted man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. By thus receiving the element of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man became fallen and natural. When this element entered into man, he became independent from God, having no reliance on God, living by himself, and even wanting to do things for God by himself. This is the basic problem of fallen man.</p>
<p>Beginning with the second generation of mankind, after Adam&rsquo;s fall, the natural man has had the problem of being independent from God, of not needing God, and of thinking that he could serve God by himself. Hence, it is difficult for us to see the pure revelation of God when we read the Bible. The central revelation in the Bible is that God wants to enter into man to be his life. If man receives the breath of life, absorbs the life of God, and enjoys the riches of God, God will be lived out from him. Man is designed to be only a receptacle, a container, to receive God.</p>
<p>The light in Genesis 1:26 is very clear. God created man with a body that was according to His likeness. Then God breathed the breath of life into man. This breath of life became the spirit of man. When the breath of life was breathed into man&rsquo;s body, man became a living soul (2:7). The soul is in the image of God, because the soul involves the mind, emotion, and will. The Bible reveals that God has a mind, emotions, and a will. A glove is a good example. Our wisdom, intelligence, and thoughts are the glove, but God&rsquo;s wisdom, intelligence, and thoughts are the hand. Our joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are the glove, but God&rsquo;s joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are the hand. We know how to propose, judge, and consider pros and cons; this is the glove. God&rsquo;s proposals, judgments, and considerations are the hand. Everything related to our soul, the glove, was created according to the image of God, the hand. Man&rsquo;s soul was created in the image of God. An image is like a picture, which does not have life. God created man with a body according to His likeness, an inner soul in His image, and a spirit for receiving Him. After man&rsquo;s spirit receives God, He will fill man&rsquo;s soul and fully express Himself through man&rsquo;s soul. When the Spirit enters into our spirit, the two spirits are joined as one spirit and live as one spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; This statement is greater than John 3:16. Regrettably, many Christians do not pay attention to this verse. This verse shows that the life of God and the life of man can be joined as one. The life of man can be joined to God, and the life of God can live in man and out from man. When the human life is joined to the divine life, man will live out the church in the present age and the New Jerusalem in the future. This is the essence of the entire Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE WORD AS LETTERS BUT<br />
REJECTING THE SPIRIT AS LIFE</h2>
<p>When we look at a person, it is easy to see his physical body, but it is not easy to see his inner being. We may be able to understand his thoughts, touch his feelings, and know his intentions, but it is impossible for us to touch his life, because life is hidden. The Bible has many layers. Most people, however, read only the outward things in the Bible. They touch only the surface of the Bible, but they do not touch the spirit of the Bible.</p>
<p>John 5:39 and 40 are precious verses. Here the Lord Jesus was rebuking those who liked to search the Scriptures. He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;You Pharisees and scribes search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you will find eternal life, but the Scriptures testify concerning Me. The letters of the Scriptures are not eternal life; I am. But you are not willing to come to Me so that you may have life.&rdquo; It is possible to search the Bible but not want the Lord Jesus, and it is also possible to read the Bible but not want life. The Jews held tightly to the Old Testament, but they held only a picture, an outer shell; they did not have reality or the life contained in the Scriptures. One day this life came, but they rejected Him and did not receive Him. They understood the teachings and the prophecies in the Old Testament, and they knew God&rsquo;s name, His character, and His deeds, but they did not receive Him as the reality. They kept an empty Bible and embraced a vain picture, but they did not have the real thing. The reality is God Himself. The Jews made a gross mistake.</p>
<p>The Jews were not the only ones to make such a mistake; the early New Testament believers also made this mistake. When John wrote Revelation, the New Testament believers had begun to keep what the apostles considered as empty letters, just as the Jews kept the Old Testament. The Jews wanted the revelation in the Old Testament but not the revealed God. Likewise, the believers in the first century neglected Christ as the living Spirit. Instead, they debated over the doctrine concerning Christ, especially concerning the person of Christ. Is He God or man? Is He God and man combined as one, or did this combination become a third person? There were at least seven schools of thought during this time. When Christ enters into man, the church is produced. But instead of paying attention to Christ as the reality, people debated over doctrines. As a result, the church became divided. When people stopped paying attention to the Spirit, the church became degraded.</p>
<p>Later, when the Bible was locked up, there was no life, no Spirit, and no revelation. Martin Luther rose up to carry out a work of reformation, but he recovered only the first step of the truth and revelation, which is justification by faith. He did not touch the Spirit or life. During the five hundred years after Martin Luther many items were recovered. Today Christians have the Old Testament, the New Testament, the writings of Luther, and also the writings of many spiritual men. These writings are of many categories. There are the writings of Madame Guyon and the mystics, the writings of Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren, the writings of the Brethren, and the writings of Brother Nee. After we came to Taiwan, we conducted many trainings and conferences. When we went to the United States, we held many Life-study trainings. However, no matter how many trainings a person attends and how much he reads, if he does not touch the Spirit, everything is empty and vain. I bear a heavy burden. Everyone wants me to release more messages, but I have spoken much over the years. We can listen to messages for twenty years, but it will be in vain if we do not touch the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures...Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life&rdquo; (John 5:39-40). The Bible can be a book of letters, but the Spirit is life. Paul says, &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:6). When Paul was raised up by the Lord to write the Epistles, the Jewish scribes and lawyers might have condemned Paul for writing something contrary to Leviticus and Numbers. I believe that Paul was strongly condemned. However, Paul had a strong burden and continued to speak in spite of the condemnation. He seemed to say, &ldquo;You Jews teach people letters, but the letter kills! I was trained by Gamaliel, but I was killed. Then one day, on the road to Damascus, the Spirit touched me and entered into me. The Spirit made me alive. I am no longer bound by the letter. I am not contradicting the Bible; rather, I live in the Spirit, who fulfills the reality of the Bible. The Bible can be fulfilled only in the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not have the power to obey the Bible or to keep the law, but Paul says that &ldquo;the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 8:4). Is this statement not proud? Paul seems to have said to the Jews, &ldquo;You talk about the Ten Commandments, but you cannot keep them. I can. Can you deal with the flesh and the self? You cannot, but I can. If you deal with the flesh and the self by yourself, it is merely asceticism. But when I walk according to the spirit, the divine Spirit kills my flesh and my self.&rdquo; John Wesley&rsquo;s holiness group taught that everyone should pursue holiness. But just as people do not have the power to keep the law, so they do not have the power to pursue holiness. Only when people live and walk according to the spirit, can the Spirit become holiness in them.</p>
<p>We should not merely study the Life-studies with our mind. We must use our spirit to pray-read them. To pray-read is to eat and drink. A person may be so busy that he does not pay attention to what he eats. He cannot remember what he has eaten. However, as long as he eats food, he will gain the benefit. If instead of eating, he studies the food on the table to know its nutritional value and how it was prepared, the food will not benefit him. Therefore, I hope that we will not just study the Bible and other spiritual books with our mind but that we would pray-read the Bible with our spirit.</p>
<p>Because we have been taught to use our mind since our youth, we tend to use our mind in spiritual things and in the church. However, we cannot use our mind in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem we will do only two things: drink of the river of water of life and eat the fruit of the tree of life. Therefore, we do not need to spend much time studying. Instead, we need to use every minute to live in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">EARNESTLY PRACTICING TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Someone once asked me, &ldquo;What do you pray for in your daily prayer time?&rdquo; I told him that I pray, &ldquo;Lord, remind me to live in the spirit. Remind me that You and I are one spirit. Remind me to speak and think in the spirit. I agree to think in the spirit and to speak in the spirit.&rdquo; I can testify that His grace is upon me. Hence, even though I rarely sin, I confess my sin every day. I confess the sin of not living in the spirit. Sometimes, immediately after talking with my wife, I say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I just spoke a word of love to my wife, but I was not in my spirit. Lord, have mercy on me.&rdquo; By so doing, I turn to the spirit. My focus is not on the committing of sins but on the use of my mingled spirit. A stone does not sin, but God does not want stones that do not sin; He wants man to live in the spirit.</p>
<p>If we would see that God wants us to live in our spirit, we would care about whether we are in the spirit in our daily living, not about right and wrong. If I am in the spirit, I will not be bothered whether people say that I am right or that I am wrong; instead, I will say Hallelujah. If I am not in the spirit, my words may seem to be full of love, power, and holiness, and I might be praised by all, but I will still need to confess my sin and ask the Lord to forgive me because my words were not in the spirit; they were merely human words.</p>
<p>I have been in elders&rsquo; meetings in which at first I did not speak, because the Spirit was not present. However, because I knew the elders well, I would speak, and the elders would appreciate my words. They would even say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your words are a great help to us. We have seen light and received the benefit.&rdquo; They did not know that afterward I had to confess to the Lord because I spoke from myself instead of from the spirit.</p>
<p>Those who are experienced know that a person can speak concerning spiritual things but not be in the spirit. We can talk about human things and about divine things without speaking from the spirit. My mouth may be full of the word of God, but I may not be in the spirit. A well-spoken message does not necessarily supply people. At best, a well-spoken message can open a person&rsquo;s mind and give him understanding. However, understanding is one thing, and receiving an inward supply is another.</p>
<p>I want people to not only understand what I say but to also touch life. When I speak, I want the Spirit to touch their spirit. The secret of being an elder is the Spirit touching others&rsquo; spirit. This is not so easy to practice. First Timothy 4:7 says, &ldquo;Exercise yourself unto godliness.&rdquo; To exercise oneself unto godliness is to exercise the spirit. We need to exercise to let the Spirit touch others&rsquo; spirit.</p>
<p>We must constantly practice to do things in our spirit. We should not speak if our words are not in the spirit, we should not entertain thoughts that are not in the spirit, and we should not express an opinion if it is not in the spirit. We should also study with our spirit. This practice is quite difficult and requires us to be exercised because besides our spirit, we also have two very active parts: our body and our soul. Unbelievers live either in the body or in the soul. They do not live in the spirit. As believers, we are often better than unbelievers, but we also live in our soul instead of in our spirit. The Lord desires that we would live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit so that the righteous requirement of the law would be fulfilled in us (Rom. 8:4). A common mistake among believers is that we only care for doctrine concerning the Spirit and statements in the Bible concerning the Spirit. However, we need to practice living in the spirit and walking according to the spirit moment by moment.</p>
<p>In order to live and to walk in the spirit, we must pray. For many years I thought that I knew how to pray unceasingly. But now I realize that to pray unceasingly is to exercise the spirit. If we do not pray, we are not in the spirit. To stop praying can be compared to turning off the light switch. When we pray, we turn on the switch. Ephesians 6:18 says, &ldquo;Praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; Only prayer can keep us living in the spirit. Therefore, we need to practice to not do anything without prayer.</p>
<p>We must realize the glorious fact that we are saved. True salvation is our spirit joined to God and His Spirit living in our spirit. This is regeneration. Prayer keeps us abiding in the spirit, which is to abide in Christ. To abide in Christ is to remain in the spirit. The Triune God has been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is the true vine, and this Spirit is in us. Hence, when we remain in the Spirit, we remain in the vine. This is what the Lord desires.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT BEING OUR CONTENT</h2>
<p>The way that we are taking is right, and the ground that we stand on is also right, but our content is not solid, because we are short of living in the spirit. The saints need to live in the spirit. I believe that if some saints would live in the spirit every day, the Lord would come back, because this is what He desires.</p>
<p>Because of the turmoil among the churches in the United States, over the past few years I have had a turn before the Lord. Although my ministry never deviated from the Spirit, my valuation of the Spirit and of life has greatly increased. Therefore, in message after message I am telling the saints to live in the spirit and to live out life. The work may propagate throughout the United States, but if we are not in the spirit and in life, there will be no benefit to the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. The Lord is not after the propagation of the work or an increase in the number of saints. He wants a group of people living in the spirit and living out the divine life in a genuine way. This does not mean that we should not develop or propagate but that our development and propagation should be like a vine that grows and bears fruit spontaneously. Our development and propagation should be the outflow of life and the expression of life.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of &ldquo;one city, one church.&rdquo; Although this is true, this ground must have content. Our content is our living in the spirit, living out Christ. Without this content our testimony is empty, and the Lord will not have a way. Our ground must be right, our way must be right, and our content must be solid, but we are short of content. To shout that we are living Christ is mere doctrine. If we do not touch the Spirit, there is no experience of living Christ, because the Christ whom we live out is the Spirit. If we live in the spirit, we will live out Christ practically. Therefore, we must practice to live in the spirit every day. The Lord is the Spirit. He is the Triune God who has been processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in order to live in our spirit. We need to remain in our spirit so that we may fellowship with Him and live Him out. This is our present need. Holiness is to live in the spirit, spirituality is to live in the spirit, victory is to live in the spirit, and the church is to live in the spirit. Living in the spirit produces the reality of the church, which is a miniature of the New Jerusalem and the testimony of the Lord. Living in the spirit will bring the Lord back.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING UNCEASINGLY AND<br />
LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">VEILS AND TRAPS</h2>
<p>We are all covered by a thick veil. This veil is our natural constitution and includes our natural concept that stems from our natural constitution. We are not the second generation of mankind born after Adam. Rather, we were born nearly six thousand years after Adam. Hence, our problem is more complicated than Cain&rsquo;s problem. The saints from China should ask themselves whether they have put off the Chinese tradition, history, and philosophy. It is difficult to put off one&rsquo;s ancestry, ethnicity, customs, culture, sentiments, and background. The Chinese are profoundly cultured, not only by our Chinese ancestry but also by the influence of Western culture. These elements constitute our inward being and have become veils that hinder us from understanding the Bible. Because we always read the Bible with these &ldquo;tinted glasses,&rdquo; we cannot see the true color of the Bible. Even though we have spoken about these problems in the past, we seem unable to drop them.</p>
<p>For example, our fallen nature influences us to study things for knowledge. Before a person is saved, he does not care about the Bible. However, as soon as he is saved and loves the Lord, he may immediately fall into the trap of thinking that he has to study the Bible. Some believers may even study church history, biographies of believers, and other spiritual writings. This is not bad, but we need to know that everything has its pros and cons. The Lord Jesus said to the Jewish religionists, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life&rdquo; (John 5:39-40). Therefore, searching the Scriptures was like poison to the Jewish religionists.</p>
<p>Many Christians cite Acts 17:10 and 11 and argue that the Bereans were noble in that they examined the Scriptures daily. This indeed is a compliment to the Bereans. However, examining the Scriptures should not be done without coming to the Lord to receive life. A person who examines the Scriptures without receiving life may not grow, even if he is saved. Of course, we must examine the Scriptures to know the truth. Nevertheless, if we use only our mind to examine the Scriptures, our growth in life will be hindered. Everything has its measure. We are benefited when we stay within the appropriate measure; however, we will suffer when we go beyond our measure.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily profitable to study the Bible every day. We should spend more time praying. Our problem is that we know the Bible, but we are short of prayer, short of the breath of life, and short of the Spirit. The believers in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery possess much Bible knowledge. Although few among us are Doctors of Divinity, in some aspects our understanding of the Bible surpasses that of the Doctors of Divinity. They may know Hebrew and Greek, Bible history and geography, and biblical names and biographies, but their understanding of the Bible is different from our understanding. If asked concerning life and the spirit, the soul, and the body, they may say that they have never read anything concerning these items. Their study is in one realm, but our training is in another realm. They are in the realm of knowledge, but we are in the realm of life.</p>
<p>Regrettably, our knowledge of life has turned into knowledge. Some have studied and even memorized the fourteen points in <em>The Knowledge of Life</em> and the nineteen items in <em>The Experience of Life.</em> This, however, should be done with prayer. We should pray over the fourteen points in <em>The Knowledge of Life</em> so that they can get into our spirit. Each of the nineteen items in <em>The Experience of Life</em> requires thorough prayer. Because we are short of prayer and the breath of life, for many years we have been unable to come out of the snare of studying but instead have fought battles over doctrine.</p>
<p>It is difficult for Christians to be one concerning doctrine. Suppose there are one hundred thirty people here. This means that there are one hundred thirty minds, and each mind is as different as one face is from another face. The divisions in Christianity are divisions in the mind. If the Christians who love and pursue the Lord would care for the spirit and practice living in the spirit instead of caring for the mind, there would be no divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING TO STRENGTHEN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>My burden is for us to see that our basic need is the breath of life, which is the Spirit, and that prayer is the only way to meet this need. We need spiritual sight to see that if our spirit is not strong and living, our effort and struggle will be in vain. If we do not pray, we will turn our attention to self-improvement. Some people are naturally inclined to asceticism and self-improvement, but this is not spiritual. The Confucianists in China focus on self-improvement and may be advanced in this area. However, just as we cannot bring the indulgence of the flesh into the church, so we cannot bring the concept of self-improvement into the church.</p>
<p>Every matter in the church is dependent on the Spirit. If we see this, we will spontaneously be willing to spend time to pray, pray-read, and call on the name of the Lord. We need to live out the reality of being joined to the Lord. He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). We need to experience being one spirit with the Lord when we talk to our spouse so that our talking will be the Lord&rsquo;s talking. This is precious. In the past our spiritual pursuit was focused on reading the Bible, studying spiritual books, and exploring various practices, but not much time was spent on prayer. This lack of prayer has caused us to suffer. Now we must drop our &ldquo;studying&rdquo; and instead pursue being one spirit with the Lord. We need to practically experience being one spirit with the Lord in all things, whether they be great or small.</p>
<p>When I speak of prayer, some people may think that I am referring to not doing anything without prayer. This is not what I am referring to. When I speak of prayer, I am referring to being one spirit with the Lord. We must always turn to our spirit in order to have genuine prayer. This is spiritual breathing. Even when a brother speaks to his relatives or friends, he should continue to pray in his spirit. He does not need to say, &ldquo;Lord, give me the appropriate words to say to my relatives and friends,&rdquo; nor does he need to say, &ldquo;Lord, keep me from losing my temper.&rdquo; These are religious prayers. He only needs to pray, &ldquo;Lord, be one spirit with me. Lead me in the spirit. May I breathe You in and experience You. Lord, keep me from turning away from You. Enable me to do things according to the Spirit.&rdquo; There is no need to be concerned with what he should say or about losing his temper. Such items are Confucian in nature. We should let these things go. The Bible requires us only to be according to the spirit and to abide in the Lord (Rom. 8:4; John 15:4). We do not need to do anything, nor do we need to ask the Lord to do anything for us.</p>
<p>Perhaps some may be confused. We have been doing things for a long time. Now we simply need to stop. However, even our stopping can become an activity. Our effort to stop ourselves can become a method. It is no wonder that the Lord did not tell us what to do. He only said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (v. 4). We only need to abide in the Lord, because He is responsible for the outcome.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT<br />
BEING EQUIVALENT TO ABIDING IN THE LORD</h2>
<p>In John 14:10 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am in the Father and the Father is in Me,&rdquo; and He also said, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.&rdquo; In verses 16 and 17 the Lord said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality;...but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; In verse 20 the Lord said, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; These verses concern the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In verse 23 the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; This verse mentions the mutual abode of the Triune God and the believers.</p>
<p>In chapter 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman&rdquo; (v. 1). The Son is the vine, and the Spirit is the reality of this vine. The Lord wants us to abide in Him, because we are branches grafted into Him. As believers, we have already been grafted into the Lord; hence, there should not be any separation between us and the Lord. If we abide in Him, He will abide in us (v. 4). In chapter 17 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us&rdquo; (v. 21). This refers to our being joined as one spirit to the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in our spirit. This is abiding in the Lord. When we are joined to the Spirit, we abide in the Lord, and the Lord abides in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT TO KILL THE PROBLEMS<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>When we live in our spirit and allow the Spirit to live in us, the flesh, the self, and the natural constitution will lose their ground in us. We are thankful to the Lord for His grace and mercy to us, but we have to admit that there is still discord among the serving ones in the churches. The only way to kill such discord is to live in the spirit. When we live in the spirit, all the problems disappear. We do not care whether others are right or wrong, good or bad. We only care to live in the spirit. Living in the spirit is the cure to heal people and to swallow up the death in the church. Everyone thinks that someone else is wrong, because when we are not in the spirit, we are in the realm of right and wrong.</p>
<p>We do not need judges among us; we only need those who live in the spirit. When we live in the spirit, there will be no problems. We blame and criticize others because no person is good. Which elder is good? Which local church is good? No one is good, because we are all descendants of Adam. If we are in the spirit, however, we will not pay attention to whether others are good or bad. If we are not in the spirit, we will always complain about the faults of the elders and the church, no matter where we may be. It might be true that the elders and the church are not good, but focusing on this shows that we are in our natural constitution, not in the spirit. If we are in the spirit, we will overflow with life instead of speaking negatively.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE URGENT NEED FOR PRAYER</h2>
<p>Our present need is prayer. We should not pray only for others and the churches; we need to pray for ourselves. This means that we need to pray ourselves into the spirit so that we would be joined to the Lord as one spirit and remain in the spirit. We need to serve in the spirit and pray in the spirit without considering the result or what to do next. The present need of the church is for the saints to live in the spirit. There is only one reason for the problems in the church: the saints do not live in the spirit. As soon as the saints begin living in the spirit, the problems will disappear. Therefore, we must live in the spirit and remain in the spirit through prayer.</p>
<p>After many years we are finally realizing that although it might be effective to make arrangements or to deal with the problems in the church, the solution is for the saints to live in the spirit. If we will live in the spirit, we will not need to deal with things or make arrangements, because the problems in the church will spontaneously be resolved. May we know and practice living in the spirit and bringing others into the spirit. This is the only way for the spiritual reality to increase among us. If we do not practice living in the Spirit, we will not have the reality of the Spirit within us, even if we understand the Bible. We are short of the reality of the Spirit because we do not live in the spirit. Our problem is a lack of prayer; we do not spend enough time in prayer; hence, our living is a living without prayer. We like to do many things, but we are not willing to pray more. The urgent need in the churches is more prayer. Prayer will cause us to live in the spirit, that is, to abide in the Spirit and abide in the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SERVING GOD IN OUR SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:9; 7:6; Phil. 3:3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN SPIRIT BEING TO CONTACT GOD</h2>
<p>Our serving God is a matter of our relationship with God and of our contacting God. God is Spirit, and we must use the proper organ to serve Him. We hear with our ears, we see with our eyes, we eat with our mouth, we walk with our feet, we work with our hands, and we think with our mind. Our spirit is the proper organ that we should use to serve God. God created man with a particular organ, the human spirit. Zechariah 12:1 says, &ldquo;Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.&rdquo; In this verse God ranks the human spirit with the heavens and the earth. God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. For many years we did not see that this verse ranks the human spirit with the heavens and the earth. In addition to the heavens and the earth, God created many other things, but Zechariah mentions only the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit. It seems more logical to speak of the heavens, the earth, and man: &ldquo;Who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms man.&rdquo; However, this verse emphatically speaks of the human spirit: &ldquo;Forms the spirit of man within him.&rdquo; Therefore, although the human spirit is a small organ, it is very crucial in the eyes of God. The greatest difference between human beings and animals is that human beings have a spirit. God did not create a spirit for any creature other than man.</p>
<p>When I first went to the United States, nearly no Christian knew about the human spirit. Among us, however, both the younger saints and the older saints know that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God. God is Spirit, and He needs man; hence, He created a spirit in man. If man did not have a spirit, he would have no way to contact God, who is Spirit. &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit&rdquo; (John 4:24). God&rsquo;s creation is for God. He created man for Himself, so He created man with a spirit.</p>
<p>Man has a body for his existence. Man also has a soul. The body needs clothing, food, shelter, and transportation; hence, the body needs the earth. The earth that God created is able to supply man with clothing, food, shelter, and transportation to meet the needs of man&rsquo;s body. This is very significant. If the earth were slightly closer to the sun, its temperature would be too high for the animals and plants to survive. If the earth were slightly farther from the sun, all the living creatures would die because the temperature of the earth would be too low. The distance between the earth and the sun is perfect; hence, the temperature of the earth is suitable for life. In addition to the right temperature, there is the provision of air, sunshine, and water, which enables things to grow on the earth. Thus, the entire earth is for man.</p>
<p>When I went to Europe in 1958, scientists were researching how to land on the moon. Some British brothers asked whether human beings would be found on the moon. I told them, &ldquo;I do not understand physics or astronomy, but I am certain that there are no human beings on the moon. If there were, the Bible would be indefensible.&rdquo; With the later advances in technology, man eventually landed on the moon and confirmed that no air and no living creatures were there. According to the photographs taken on the moon, the moon is a barren place with no grass, no trees, and no living creatures. We thank the Lord that the earth is full of living creatures, and man is able to live on the earth. In order for grain to grow out of the ground, nutrients are needed in the soil; there is also the need for air, sunshine, and water, all of which come from heaven. This shows that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God. Man has a spirit so that he can contact God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE TO GOD BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we talk about serving God, we must also talk about the human spirit. Christianity has become a religion because it is degraded in the matter of the spirit. Religion is to serve God and to do things to please God without Christ. To preach the gospel without the spirit is religion. To study and interpret the Bible without the spirit are religion. Even to pray and sing hymns without the spirit are religion. The definition of religion is that man worships and serves God and does things to please God without the Spirit of God and without the human spirit. The Spirit of God is joined to our spirit as one spirit. Romans 7:6 says, &ldquo;We serve in newness of spirit.&rdquo; It is hard to tell whether <em>spirit</em> here refers to the Spirit of God or to the spirit of man. According to my personal understanding, <em>spirit</em> here refers to the Spirit of God and to the spirit of man. In other words, it is two spirits joined as one spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The word <em>spirit</em> in these two verses refers to the two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit, joined as one spirit. Such a spirit is the organ for us to serve God.</p>
<p>In order to work in society, people focus on methods and tools. When we serve God in the church, however, we need to use our spirit. In order to teach in a college, a person must have a sound mind, knowledge, eloquence, and persuasive speech. However, although we need a clear mind and good articulation to speak for the Lord in the church, we mainly need to use our spirit. If we speak in the church without our spirit, we will be like a puppet. For whatever we do in the church, we must use our spirit. We must even use our spirit when we are cleaning the floor. If we would use our spirit in this way, we will be able to supply others with life when we fellowship with them. Even the ones who are ushering must use their spirit so that those who are ushered may touch life. If we do not use our spirit, we cannot supply life to others. In the church meetings there should not be an usher who does not use his spirit. Whether an usher smiles is not what matters. What matters is whether he uses his spirit. Those who serve as ushers must push out their spirit. The spirit is the genuineness of man. Hence, when we use our spirit, what is genuine within will be manifested.</p>
<p>In order for our spirit to come out when we serve as ushers, our spirit first needs to be filled. Our spirit cannot come out unless it is filled. A cup that is only half full of water will not overflow. Only when the cup is filled with water can it overflow. Suppose a brother gets angry at home and in the evening goes to serve as an usher. Although he may have a smile on his face, others will sense anger coming out of him, because he is filled with anger. Suppose the brother did not get angry at home, nor did he fellowship with the Lord. When he stands at the entrance of the meeting hall to usher the saints, neither anger nor joy will come out of him, nor will his spirit come out. This kind of ushering is empty. Hence, before serving as ushers, the saints must go to the Lord and pray, &ldquo;Lord, I love You, and I need You. Lord, I come to You.&rdquo; We need to pray for at least twenty minutes. Without prayer, our spirit will not come out.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF PRAYER FOR SERVING<br />
IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our human spirit has been mingled with the Spirit of God. Now the two are one spirit. Our human spirit is the vessel, and the Spirit of God is the content. Our spirit is to contain the Spirit. In order for our spirit to contain the Spirit, we must have prayer. Therefore, before the ushers serve, they must pray to be filled with the Spirit as oil. The same applies to cleaning. Without prayer, everyone who cleans will do his own thing, and no one will supply the Spirit. Such a service is empty. Before we serve in the church, we must pray until we are saturated and filled with the Spirit. Then our spirit will come out when we serve, and we will be able to supply life to one another. This is the secret to serving.</p>
<p>In Romans 1:9 and 10 Paul says, &ldquo;God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers, beseeching.&rdquo; This indicates that our service to God in our spirit cannot be separated from prayer and petitions. If we do not pray, our service will not be in the spirit. Therefore, we must pray.</p>
<p>Some brothers are concerned that although the younger saints are easily stirred up during conferences, their spirit cools down after a few days. The brothers are also concerned that the elderly saints are not easily moved and that their spirit is not always fresh. Prayer is the solution to these two problems. In order for our spirit to be burning and always fresh, we must pray and contact the Lord. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;Unceasingly pray&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:17).</p>
<p>In the past we did not understand how to pray while we were doing other things, such as working or teaching. Now we know that to unceasingly pray means that we need to have a spirit of prayer so that we constantly contact the Lord. In order to achieve this, we first must have set times for prayer. If we do not have some set times during the day for prayer, it will be hard to maintain constant contact with the Lord. In the morning we need to spend some time to pray ourselves into the spirit of prayer. In the afternoon we again need to take some time to pray. In the evening we should again pray ourselves into the spirit of prayer. When we live in the spirit of prayer, we will spontaneously pray in the classroom and in the office. This is the meaning of unceasingly praying. Our experience shows that we need set times during the day for prayer. No matter how busy we may be, we must find time to pray in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening. Without praying, our spirit will not be fresh.</p>
<p>Every morning we should spend time to pray before the Lord, whether it is for ten minutes, fifteen minutes, or twenty minutes. We should not pray for any person, matter, or thing. We should simply contact the Lord and fellowship with Him. If we sense a sin, we should deal with it by confessing it and asking the Lord to cleanse us with His precious blood. We can also spend some time to read the Bible in order to receive the supply. No matter how busy we may be, we should try our best to keep this time for prayer. It is possible that a few mornings we may not have enough time to pray. However, if we consistently do not have enough time to pray in the morning, yet we continue coming punctually to the meetings, we will be in religion. The normal condition of a Christian is to pray for a few minutes every morning. Then later during the day we should always have other times of prayer. We should also find time to pray in the evening. We must pray daily. There is no other way to serve.</p>
<p>If we are persons of prayer, living in the spirit of prayer, we will spontaneously bring those under our care into a living of prayer. If the younger saints are not brought into the spirit of prayer to have a living of prayer, they will not be kept under God&rsquo;s blessing. The only way to remain under the blessing is to be brought into the spirit of prayer and into a living of prayer. It is worthwhile to touch the spirit of prayer and have a living of prayer.</p>
<p>In the past we had the concept that the way to release our spirit was to praise the Lord and call on His name with a loud voice in the meetings. Although we cannot say that this is not the way to release our spirit, the emphasis of releasing and exercising our spirit is on contacting the Lord. Therefore, we need to exercise our spirit twenty-four hours a day. We should even exercise our spirit while we are resting. I can testify that I receive much light from my fellowship with the Lord in prayer while I am resting. This is how to exercise our spirit in our daily life. We should not have the mistaken concept that we can lose our temper and curse people when we are at home and still shout &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; in the meeting. Such spiritual conduct is a show and a pretense. We need to exercise our spirit every day by speaking to people with our spirit and doing things from our spirit. We need to exercise until we can do everything from our spirit. This is the way for us to carry out our service. Hence, the Bible speaks of serving &ldquo;in my spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 1:9), serving &ldquo;in newness of spirit&rdquo; (7:6), and serving &ldquo;by the Spirit of God&rdquo; (Phil. 3:3). We must practice to exercise our spirit every day. Whether we are serving children or young people, praying, singing hymns, cleaning, or ushering, we must exercise our spirit, and in order to exercise our spirit, we must pray. Before we do anything, we first need to pray in order to be filled with the Spirit as oil.</p>
<p>The many problems that we encounter in the service of the church are insignificant. The real problem is our lack in exercising our spirit. When we exercise our spirit, our flesh is dealt with, and our temper dissipates. Suppose some sisters are easily offended. The best way for them to overcome their temper is to pray. Prayer is the way to stop our temper. We just need to be diligent to exercise our spirit and pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am about to lose my temper. Lord, fill me. I praise You.&rdquo; Then we will be filled in spirit, our anger will dissipate, and our problem will be resolved. Besides prayer, there is no other way to deal with the flesh, lusts, and temper. The work of the Spirit within us requires our cooperation by prayer. Prayer is the way to use, exercise, and strengthen our spirit. The more we pray, the stronger and fresher our spirit will be. Although it is hard to explain this mystery, we can understand and experience it by praying. We must pray and exercise our spirit so that we can serve God in spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ANOINTING OIL BEING<br />
ON THE TABERNACLE AND THE PRIESTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 30:31-33; Rom. 8:7-8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE TABERNACLE AND<br />
ITS FURNITURE AND UTENSILS BEING ANOINTED<br />
WITH THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL</h2>
<p>According to Exodus 30, the holy anointing oil had two functions. The first function was to anoint the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils (vv. 26-28). The second function was to anoint the priests (v. 30). The tabernacle with its furniture and utensils were for the testimony of God, for the service to God, and for the dwelling place of God. Hence, the tabernacle is called the Tabernacle of the Testimony (38:21; Num. 1:50), and the Ark is called the Ark of the Testimony (Exo. 25:22; 26:33). The word <em>covenant</em> in <em>the Ark of the Covenant</em> (cf. Josh. 3:3) refers to the law. The law that was given through Moses is the testimony of God in the Old Testament, because the law speaks forth God&rsquo;s being. The law shows who God is. He is a holy God, a righteous God, a loving God, and a shining God. These four attributes&mdash;holiness, righteousness, love, and light&mdash;are the intrinsic essence of the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments are ten laws, and the intrinsic essence of the Ten Commandments is holiness, righteousness, love, and light. Hence, the Ten Commandments speak forth God and testify of God. The law is the testimony of God (Exo. 16:34; 31:18; 32:15; 40:20; Psa. 19:7). This testimony is also a type of Christ because Christ is the holiness, righteousness, love, and light of God. The Ark typifies Christ.</p>
<p>The tabernacle also typifies Christ. The Tabernacle of the Testimony is a testimony of God. The tabernacle was the dwelling place of God on earth; it was the place where God dwelt. This testimony and dwelling place were also the means by which man served God. Where could man serve God, and by what means could man serve God? In the Old Testament any person who wanted to serve God had to go to the tabernacle. All the activities of serving God had to be carried out through the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle. The altar and the laver were in the outer court of the tabernacle. In the Holy Place of the tabernacle there were the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar. Behind the veil in the Holy Place there was the Ark in the Holy of Holies. These pieces of furniture were the means by which man served God.</p>
<p>The first step in serving God involved offering sacrifices at the altar. The altar typifies the cross of Christ. The next step involved the laver, which typifies the renewing of the Holy Spirit. After the altar and the laver, a person advanced into the Holy Place, where there was the table of the bread of the Presence, which typifies Christ as the bread of life. There were also the lampstand, which typifies the shining forth of the light of life, and the golden incense altar, which typifies man&rsquo;s fellowship with God. In the last step a person entered into the Holy of Holies. In this step he could enjoy Christ, typified by the Ark. Every step of the service to God was carried out through these pieces of furniture.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to us today. If we want to serve God, we must enter into the tabernacle of God. The tabernacle of God typifies not only Christ but also the church. According to typology, the Ark of the Testimony typifies the individual Christ, but the Tabernacle of the Testimony typifies not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ, which is the church. Christ is the Ark of the Testimony, and the church is the Tabernacle of the Testimony. These two, Christ and the church, are joined together as one to be the testimony of God, the dwelling place of God, and the means by which man serves God. Where do we serve God? We need to serve Him in Christ and in the church, that is, in the place with the Ark of the Testimony and the Tabernacle of the Testimony. In other words, we must be wherever the church is in order to serve God. Christ is in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTS BEING<br />
ANOINTED WITH THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL</h2>
<p>The first function of the holy anointing oil was to anoint the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils. The second function was to anoint the priests. The priestly service was to bring God to man and to bring man to God. The priests came forth from God, thus bringing God to man, and they returned to God from man, thus bringing man to God. Therefore, the priests were mediators between God and man. We are priests if we have fellowship with God, bring God to man by coming forth from God, and also bring man to God.</p>
<p>To preach the gospel is a priestly service, because we must first contact God. We need to pray until our prayer is thorough and unhindered and until we are filled within with the Spirit. Then when we contact people with the gospel, our gospel will be God. Galatians 3:14 says that the blessing God promised Abraham is the blessing of the gospel, which is the Spirit. It may seem as though we are doing the work of the evangelists by first fellowshipping with God to be filled with the Spirit and then going to contact sinners and bringing them to God, but in reality we are today&rsquo;s priests.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we visit people, we first need to pray ourselves into God. The more we pray, the more we will be filled within with the Spirit, that is, filled with God and the anointing oil. Then we can go to visit people. Visiting people in this way will not be our going on our own. There is no value to going on our own, because visiting without the anointing oil does not have any fragrance or beauty. We need to go with God, with the anointing oil, with the Spirit. Then our going will bring God to man. After bringing God to someone, we need to pray with him in order to bring him into God. This is our service as priests.</p>
<p>We can also function as priests while cleaning the meeting hall. No matter what we do, as long as we do it with God and in fellowship to bring people into God, we are functioning as priests. Hence, before we begin cleaning, we should first pray until our prayer is thorough and unhindered and until we are filled with the Spirit. It does not matter what we are cleaning, because cleaning is only a means. We need to serve together with the saints. While we are cleaning, we should flow out life, minister life, to bring the Spirit to others. This is what it means to serve as priests.</p>
<p>We all have had such experiences in our service in the church. While we are cleaning, a sister may speak a word that causes us to touch God and hence brings us into God. By speaking in such a way, this sister is serving as a priest. To minister God to others does not require the giving of a message. Whether we are cleaning the restrooms or the chairs and tables, we can supply others. Standing at the podium is not the measure of who a priest is; the measure of a priest is the ministering of God to people. If we contact God and are filled with Him, with the Spirit, and with the anointing oil, people will touch the anointing oil when they touch us, no matter how we serve. This is to serve as a priest.</p>
<p>Exodus 30:32-33 says that the holy anointing oil was not to be poured upon the flesh of any person, not even on a stranger. Verse 32 says, &ldquo;Upon the flesh of man it shall not be poured.&rdquo; Verse 33 says, &ldquo;Whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.&rdquo; The word <em>stranger</em> refers to people outside of the priesthood. Anyone who is not a priest, one bringing God to man and bringing man to God, is a stranger. Sometimes we clean the meeting hall as priests, but at other times we clean the meeting hall as strangers. If we pray in a thorough and unhindered way and are filled with the Spirit, we will do the cleaning as a priest. Sometimes we come to serve without praying or touching God. Although matters may be taken care of, we will not bring God to man or man to God. At such times we are serving as strangers.</p>
<p>Concerning not pouring the anointing oil upon the flesh of man, we need to consider the three parts of man. Man has a body, a spirit, and a soul, which is in between the body and the spirit. The mind is the primary part in the soul. Romans 8 speaks of the three parts of man. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; This verse shows that the spirit becomes life. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; This verse shows that the mind can stand on the side of the spirit to reject the flesh. Formerly, our mind cooperated with the flesh to do evil, but now that we have received grace, our mind no longer has to be an ally with our flesh. Rather, our mind should stand on the side of our spirit and be set on our spirit. The mind set on the spirit is life. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; Our mortal body will also receive life. These three verses show that all three parts of a believer will become life.</p>
<p>Concerning the holy anointing oil, Exodus 30:32 says, &ldquo;Upon the flesh of man it shall not be poured.&rdquo; In other words, we must not live by the flesh if we want to enjoy the holy anointing oil. When we live by the flesh, we cannot partake of the holy anointing oil. The holy anointing oil leaks out when we speak or walk by the flesh, express our opinions, or treat others according to the flesh. Therefore, we must allow the cross to work in our being. Galatians 5:19 through 21 list many works of the flesh, and verses 22 and 23 list the fruit of the Spirit. Verse 24 says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; When the flesh is active, the anointing oil is not manifested. This is the law of God. Hence, Romans 8:7 says, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be,&rdquo; and verse 8 says, &ldquo;Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God will never allow His Spirit to be poured out upon our flesh, nor will He allow His Spirit to work together with our flesh. Therefore, our flesh must be put on the cross. Romans 8 is the commentary and fulfillment of Exodus 30. Exodus 30 has the holy anointing oil, and Romans 8 has the Spirit. Exodus 30 has the flesh, and Romans 8 also has the flesh. However, Romans 8 addresses the flesh more thoroughly. The flesh cannot please God. The flesh is enmity against God. The flesh prevents man from keeping the law of God. Hence, the flesh has nothing to do with the Spirit, the holy anointing oil.</p>
<p>It is easy for us to live in the flesh. The flesh is working when two brothers dislike each other and also when two sisters love each other and intimately confide in each other. The flesh is working when the young people want to spend time only with other young people, can barely carry on a conversation with older saints, and are not fond of the older saints. The flesh is also working when the older saints will not have anything to do with the younger saints. The flesh is not allowed in the service of the church. The younger ones should not reject the older ones, and the older ones need to cover the younger ones. The church needs both the older saints and the younger saints. First John 2:13 speaks of &ldquo;fathers,&rdquo; &ldquo;young men,&rdquo; and &ldquo;young children.&rdquo; John puts these three kinds of people together as a test to the flesh. Naughty children are a test, young men who think that they are capable are a test, and long-winded older people are also a test. However, we must remember that the church is not just the army of God but also the family of God. In a normal family there should be these three kinds of people. Fathers, young men, and young children are indispensable.</p>
<p>The flesh refers to doing everything according to one&rsquo;s own will and feeling. When we come to serve in the church, we must do everything according to the spirit and set our mind on the spirit. In the church the younger saints have their function, the middle-aged saints have their function, and the older saints also have their function. No one should have his own concept. Whenever we have our own concept, we are in the flesh. The flesh causes us to lose the Spirit, the anointing oil. In the flesh we should not rebuke people, nor should we praise people. This is not easy. When Peter went to Antioch, Paul opposed him to his face because he stood condemned (Gal. 2:11). However, Paul was not in the flesh. When we speak and do things in the church, we must learn to reject our flesh.</p>
<p>If we clean the meeting hall without the Spirit, we might be cleaning in the flesh. If we are in the flesh, we will stop cleaning when the elders rebuke us but clean more when we are praised. This is the flesh, not the spirit. Even though we may not have conflicts in the church, we do not have enough of the Spirit. When an outsider comes among us, he will sense that the one accord is not sufficient. If we do not have the presence of the Holy Spirit or the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, people will not receive a supply when they come to the church. Hence, if we are not in the spirit, the church will suffer loss.</p>
<p>Everything that we do in the church must be done in our spirit. Instead of serving in the flesh, we must reject the flesh. When we reject the flesh, we will be able to handle both criticism and praise, both positive and negative remarks. When we reject the flesh, the Spirit as the anointing oil is present, and we become priests to bring God to man and man to God. Thus, we become a pure channel between God and man that can flow the pure divine life into man and bring man into God. Through us God and man can have fellowship. Then together we become the tabernacle with the Ark, which is Christ in our midst. What a glorious scene this is!</p></body></html>
