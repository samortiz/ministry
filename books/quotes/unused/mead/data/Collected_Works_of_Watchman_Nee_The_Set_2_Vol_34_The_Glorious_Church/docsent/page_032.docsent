   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once our conscience is weakened, we are finished.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we accept them, we will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when Satan speaks to us, we can reply to all his reasons with the one answer of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is not a single reason which cannot be answered by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Spiritual warfare requires a conscience without offense, and the blood alone can give us such a conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 10:2 says, "Because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins..."</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once we stand on the ground of the blood, once we believe in the blood, Satan can no longer work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We often like to reason that we can no longer fight because we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Lord knows that we are sinful, so He has prepared the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord has a way for sinful man, because the Lord has the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But He has no way for one who willingly receives Satan's accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Anyone who accepts the accusations of Satan denies the power of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one who believes in the precious blood can receive Satan's accusations at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Either one or the other must go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we accept the accusations, the blood has to go; if we accept the blood, the accusations have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is the High Priest and Mediator for us see Heb 2:17-18; 4:14-16; 7:20-28; 8:6; 9:15; 1 John 2:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord is our Mediator, our Defender.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord speaks for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But do we stand on the side of the Mediator or on the side of the accuser?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It would be ridiculous if we believed the words of the accuser while our Mediator is in the very act of defending us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If an attorney continually proved that a defendant was not guilty and defendant persisted in believing the accuser, would that not be quite absurd?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oh, may we see that the Lord Jesus is our Mediator and that He is defending us.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The blood is our only foundation.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should deal with the power of Satan according to God's valuation of the blood, not according to our valuation of the blood.</S>
