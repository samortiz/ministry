   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERY NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVER BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A PRIEST OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament God ordains that every believer should be a priest of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moreover, the service of the gospel priest is a priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every believer has to be a priest from the time that he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A priest is one who serves God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament priest is a gospel-preaching priest; that is, he is a priest that serves God in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not the duty of a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, it is the universal responsibility of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This, however, is not what we see in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christianity employs a few clergymen who have studied theology and have learned some biblical truth to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These clergymen are only a minority among all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most of the others are considered laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What about the situation among us?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have had the proper teaching among us in the past, but there was not the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We said that we are all New Testament priests of the gospel and that as priests we should offer up gospel sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The gospel sacrifices are not bulls and goats; rather, they are the saved sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you save a sinner and offer him up to God as a sacrifice, you are a priest of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul said in Romans 15:16, That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul said that as a priest of the gospel, he offered up the nations to God as offerings, which are the sinners saved through his gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps you would say, But this is Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I cannot do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a feudalistic mentality, one under an ecclesiastical and clerical concept.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is feudalism within Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said that as far as being a Christian is concerned, he was less than the least of all saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, according to the Bible, God chose Paul to be the pattern to all those who believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since he was a pattern, whatever he did should be done by us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever he could do, we should also be able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A WRONG SYSTEM PARALYZING THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our way in the past was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we talked about preaching the gospel, we considered that a certain brother would stand on the platform to release a message.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was the one that had the ecclesiastical position and clerical power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As to the other brothers and sisters, their job was just to help that one to lead the songs, pray, and read the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some would also help in cleaning the hall, arranging the chairs, inviting the friends, and preparing the love feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the time of the meeting, they did not have to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All they needed to do was to help the gospel friends turn the pages of the Bible and hymn book and help them write down their names after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we took the wrong way, the gospel service which should have been for everyone was left to a few who were capable in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The rest of the brothers and sisters all became Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was a deception of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In God s wisdom He wants everyone to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan s deception is not to stop people from preaching the gospel entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, it is to turn God s wise way into human ways.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants every saved person to be a living member of the Body of Christ, but man s way is to invite big evangelists to conduct campaigns.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All of the other believers then become the Levites helping in miscellaneous affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone depends on the particular one to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no need to go out to knock on doors or learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way everyone s spiritual function is killed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even today many Christians still do not know how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today s Christianity can be considered half paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Among us, four and a half years ago, the situation was similar.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I observed the situation and knew that the condition was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord s recovery had fallen into a condition of stagnation, and there was no progress.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although through our publications the Lord s recovery was sent to all the continents of the world, the rate of increase and spread in all the churches was not satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, I knew that our condition was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This stagnant condition was a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I cast aside all considerations and dropped the work in the West to come to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have spent the past four years specifically on the study of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have re-studied the Bible and reconsidered church history as well as the practices among us.</S>
