   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot receive the divine revelation through such fanciful imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, we receive it by the spirit of wisdom and revelation, spoken of in Ephesians 1:17.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spirit here is the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank God that today in the universe there is not only the divine Spirit or only the human spirit but also the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God and man can be mingled together as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Basically, the way to receive revelation is by the mingled spirit, that is, by the divine Spirit indwelling the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This mingled spirit is called the spirit of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is for our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have a revelation, we need the wisdom to interpret and understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through Much Prayer in Contacting the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To receive revelation from the holy Word we also need much prayer in contacting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as walking is the best way to exercise our legs, prayer is the best way to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nothing exercises our spirit as much as prayer does.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more prayer we have over the word, the more the light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through prayer, we touch the word, the Spirit of God, and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit of God is Christ, and Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God, the word, the Spirit, Christ, and our spirit are blended together through prayer so that we can receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE WAY TO SEE VISION THROUGH THE DIVINE REVELATION A. Through the Enlightenment of the Divine Light</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must have the revelation first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then that revelation under the enlightenment of the divine light Eph 1:18b becomes a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to illustrate this, let us consider the vision in chapters five and six of Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this book we can see that the lover of Christ, through living in Christ's ascension as God's new creation in resurrection, becomes mature and rich in life to be a garden to Christ 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She also becomes the sanctuary of God in the heavens 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, she is a garden to Christ on the earth and a sanctuary of God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The garden stresses the riches of Christ's life with all kinds of beautiful trees and fragrant spices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sanctuary of God in the heavens indicates that Christ's life also has a building element.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sanctuary in the heavens has a veil separating it into two parts; the outer part is the Holy Place, and the inner part is the Holy of Holies, where God Himself is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may live in the sanctuary of God, yet still not be living within the veil, in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So there is a calling of Christ asking us to live within the veil where God is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy of Holies is both God Himself and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the seeker enters within the veil, she becomes like the heavenly bodies, the moon and the sun, to be the shining of God's light in the universe 6:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She also becomes a terrible army v. 10b to fight the spiritual warfare seen in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ultimately, she becomes a Shulammite S.S. 6:13 . The name Shulammite is the feminine form of Solomon, indicating that she has become Solomon's duplication.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the seeker and lover of Christ becomes five things: the garden, the sanctuary of God, the heavenly bodies, the terrible army, and the Shulammite.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The New Jerusalem is the real and consummate Shulammite.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the vision we can receive through being enlightened by the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to become a garden with the riches of Christ's life for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we must become a sanctuary of God to be God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also have to pass through the dealing of the cross so we can live within the veil in God's Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we become like the shining heavenly bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are not only sanctified but also heavenly like God is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such ones are God's overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These overcomers are a terrible army to fight down all the enemies of God as seen in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will usher in the New Jerusalem, typified by the Shulammite.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Jerusalem, on the one hand, is God's dwelling place, and on the other hand, is Christ's wife, the Shulammite.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The wife of Christ and Christ are joined together to be the New Jerusalem for God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That is the consummated Shulammite.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By this we can see that the Song of Songs covers the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>B. By Contacting the Lord through the Reviewing of the Divine Revelation in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I received the vision in Song of Songs 5 and 6 through reviewing the divine revelation again and again by contacting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are one with the Lord in our spirit, so we must review the divine revelation in our spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the light shines to bring us the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Otherwise, at most we can have only revelation but no vision.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After we review the divine revelation again and again in our spirit with the Lord Himself, more light comes, and the vision is here for us to see.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>C. By Having the Spiritual Sight</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need the ability to see the vision, and the seeing ability is the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul prayed in Ephesians 1:18 that the eyes of our heart would be enlightened that we might see.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need not only the light but also the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There may be some wonderful scenery in front of us, but without the light, we cannot see a vision of this scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the light comes, the vision is here.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if we do not have the sight, we will still not be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need the revelation plus the light plus the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The light comes from God; the sight is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The revelation plus the divine light with our sight brings us the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>D. The Divine Vision Being Mostly concerning God's Move</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The book of Acts shows that the divine vision is mostly concerning God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul saw a heavenly vision, and in this vision God charged Paul to move to preach the gospel to the Gentile world Acts 26:16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul also saw a vision of a Macedonian calling him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Right away he moved from Asia across the sea to Macedonia, the southeastern part of Europe 16:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That was a move.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Acts 1 the Lord told the disciples that they would receive the Spirit to witness for Him from Jerusalem through Judea and Samaria to the uttermost part of the earth v. 8 . Acts 10 records the vision which Peter received while he was praying vv.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>9-16; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In that vision God charged Peter to move to the Gentiles through an Italian centurion named Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This shows that the vision we receive from the Lord will cause us to move.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We move according to the vision we have seen.</S>
