These six verses from Ephesians 4 have a number of crucial points, but the focus of these crucial points is the perfecting of the saints
Also, there will be nothing to cause the growth of the Body in life that functions may come out to build up the Body in love
We need to cover several points so that everyone may be impressed with what we are doing in this Perfecting Training
In a large socalled church with perhaps three thousand five thousand or even seven thousand members not one is a proper functioning member
What they have is just some hired professional preachers and ministers and certain rules and regulations of their organization
We can see clearly from these verses that the Body of Christ is built up by the function of every member in its measure
Many of you have been here for more than three and one-half years, attending the church meetings and training meetings
Some among us do not have the growth in life, others do not function, and many who do function are not so effective
Do you feel that although the saints would never miss a meeting, they might unconsciously miss the proper spiritual eating?
It is one thing to have a heart, but it is another thing to be consistently partaking of the riches that are available
If this brother considers the mistreatment as something from the Lord, his old man, his flesh, will be strengthened to the uttermost
We must realize, though, that just because the brother realizes he has some ambition, this does not mean he has been enlightened by the Lord
Even if you pick up the most spiritual teachings, they will simply make you a religious person, not a person who is growing in life
Whatever our situations or circumstances, we should not pick up teachings, doctrines, or lessons and try to apply them to our situations
According to your word, he should not care so much whether people appreciate or depreciate what he is and what he does for the Lord
Although he is among the saints all the time and he is in the church and in the recovery, he is like a drop of oil in a bucket of water
On the contrary, when a drop of water is dropped into a large amount of water, it immediately loses its identification
To be flexible concerning the meetings means that whether the meeting is good or bad, high or low, he would still function
If the church situation does not fit his feeling, he would not grow, but if the church situation fits his feeling, then he would grow
If he does not function adequately or if his function is not effective, then there must be a problem with his growth in life
Whether he has the adequate growth in life is something ambiguous and invisible, but the function is visible all the time
Only the life-giving Spirit through the enlightenment from the heavens can deal with the diseases we have within us
Last week we saw there is a real lack of functioning in the members because we try to hide and protect ourselves
It seems that our problem in functioning and our problem in the growth of life has to do with an element of the self
According to your fellowship, the only reason that we are lacking the building up, or we are lacking the functions, is the self
As a whole we have to say that the lack of building up and the lack of function is due to the shortage of the growth in life
You cannot say that the Word of God is not real or that there is no atmosphere or circumstance to help us grow
We do recognize that the self is a hindrance to our growth in life, but we must consider whether or not there are some other factors
In the last message we pointed out that we may have eaten a lot, but within us there is another eater which consumes all our nourishment
Although you have been eating and receiving much food, nearly all the nourishment has been swallowed up by this big eater within you
You come to the meeting, and you receive the message, accepting the Lord's provision, yet within you there is a bigger eater
The stronger your opinion is, the less you will grow; the stronger your opinion is, the less you will function
Some could realize and testify that because their last function was full of opinion, that function terminated their function
Has there ever been a time when the elders announced something or did something and you did not have an opinion?
None of us can say that he has been attending the meetings for three and one-half years and yet has never criticized anyone
According to our concept, something may be just a little opinion; it is not hatred; it is not envy; it is not strife; it is not jealousy
Even to consider that the church is free, the church is democratic, the church is this, or the church is that, is just an opinion
Don't think that simply to say something negative is an opinion, but to say something positive is not an opinion
You simply need to love the Lord, to walk in the spirit, to receive the daily portion of grace, and to be actually one spirit with Him
When you went to pray, you had no spirit; when you came to the meeting, you had no spirit; when you tried to function, you had no spirit
You will simply open your mouth and a lot of prayer will come out of your spirit because you have a lot of storage in your spirit
Because you have had too much talking according to your opinion, all the fatness in your spirit has been consumed
All the saints have been saved by You, and the church has been set up by You, established by You, and is being built by You
If you would drop your opinion, your talking, and your opinionated prayer, the well speaking will come out of your spirit
In the family life or the marriage life, the troubles come mostly because you are not flexible due to your opinion
Sometimes, even though you attend a very high meeting, you receive little nourishment because your opinion eats you up
One day as we were fellowshipping, one of the brothers pointed out that since we had been serving together, we had never prayed
At any time, under any circumstances, it will be easy for you to pray, to speak, to utter something, or to function
You will see that your praying spirit will be strong and you will have some well speaking concerning the Lord coming out of your mouth
Through the years the Lord has opened our eyes, and we all have seen that God's eternal purpose, God's ultimate intention, is to get a Body
Individual salvation or individual spirituality has become the goal of many Christians, but in the Bible God's standard is not that low
Even during the time of the Reformation, those servants of God who were the reformers were not one; every reformer held his own opinion
We have to admit that even in the Lord's recovery we are slow in the growth of life, and we are not that prevailing in function
We learned in the past that the self is the source of opinion, but the mind is the leading part of the self that directs the operation
Whether you are good or bad, whether your concept is high or low, whether your idea is right or wrong, all these are nothing but opinion
It is correct to say that at the fall the tree of knowledge got into man and made him the embodiment of opinion
You love the Lord, and you have seen the church, and you are for His recovery, yet you haven't seen that you are the embodiment of opinion
It is much easier to preach the gospel to a person with a high school education than a graduate from a university
You also must realize that your background, your environment, and your circumstances are also a kind of development of your opinion
He was there as the resurrection life, but what frustrated them from experiencing Him as the resurrection life were the opinions
The Lord is among us as the resurrection life, and He wants to be resurrection life to us, but our opinions cause Him to weep
Rather, the New Testament says, 'walk by the Spirit' ; it also says, 'He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
Now it is not a matter of the face or the presence of the Lord; now it is a matter that you and the Lord are one spirit
If you would bring this matter into your daily practice you will discover that this is the hardest thing to practice
Today Satan is blinding the Christians with all these Old Testament terms and practices from seeing the New Testament
In Philippians 2:20 Paul said that he had no one like-souled who would genuinely care for what concerned the Philippians
In Philippians 2 and 4 Paul even says we need to think the same thing and that we need to think the one thing, that is, Christ
To have only one goal, one object and to practice the one spirit is the practical way to kill our opinions, to heal this disease
In the past, when we realized there was a problem of oneness between two brothers, we did our best to help them sympathize with one another
Whether you consider yourself to be opinionated or you consider others to be opinionated, you can never stay away from opinions
If you practice you will discover that out of the sixteen hours, most of the hours you do not practice the one spirit with the Lord
You pray by yourself; you study the Bible by yourself; you fellowship with others by yourself; you do many things by yourself
You do not practice the one spirit with the Lord, so whatever you say and whatever you do is altogether opinion
How good you are or how bad you are makes little difference; as long as you are apart from God, you are just the embodiment of opinion
The light will expose you to the uttermost and will help you to understand fully that apart from God you are nothing but opinion
Whatever is covered in this Perfecting Meeting as a kind of point, you need to bring to the Lord and stay with Him
Otherwise, you may make all the points of this Perfecting Meeting simply points of doctrines, teachings, and not practical dealings
If you want the practical dealings instead of doctrinal points, you surely must bring all these points to the Lord
Medicines come in different forms and substances: some are in liquid form, some are in powder form, and some are in pill form
If you don't have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, you could never live Christ, and you could never magnify Christ
Their concept is that the Spirit is for speaking in tongues, for manifesting the gifts, for healings, for miracles, for prophesying
It may have healings or miraculous things, but it is not for the healings and the miraculous things; it is for Christ
The one spirit is the medicine not just for healing your opinion, but also for you to live Christ and magnify Christ
If you are going to apply the Spirit, you need to see that Christ has to be the centrality and universality of your whole being
It says, 'think the same thing' ; 'have this mind' ; 'thinking the one thing' ; be 'like-souled' ; 'with one soul' ; and 'joined in soul'
They had too many thoughts; they had different minds; they had different souls because they were lacking Christ
They could not apply the medicine of the Spirit until they had seen the vision that God wanted them to be fully occupied with Christ
Suppose you want to wash the dishes with warm water, but your wife wants to wash the dishes with boiling water
Whether we wash the dishes quickly or slowly or well or poorly, whether we drink tea quickly or slowly-all of these are not Christ
If you see the vision that only Christ counts, you don't need to wait for the supply of the Spirit; you just take it
When others accept your proposal you are happy, but whenever your proposal is rejected, you feel insulted and offended
While you are trying to debate with your wife concerning how to deal with the children you have to ask, Is this Christ?
Not only in the church life and in the Lord's work, but also in the family life we need to be occupied by Christ
Rather, the best way to apply the medicine of the one spirit is just to stand with the vision that Christ must be everything to you
The Spirit is all-inclusive and almighty, but the situation among many good Christians is that they are fighting
The Spirit is there, and the Spirit is strong, but He has no way because we don't practice the way to apply the Spirit
Because of some problem in the Lord's work, we may go to the Lord again and again and may even weep before the Lord
Otherwise, in our family we will have a lot of problems, and in the church among all the brothers and sisters we will have a lot of problems
Many of the saints who are in the Lord's recovery surely love the Lord, and they love the Lord's recovery, and they have seen the church
We cannot stay away from the saints because they are the members of the Body, yet we don't have that much building up
If we have such an overall vision concerning Christ, this will become a base for us to apply the medicine of the Spirit
Through the Spirit-given utterance, Christ will spontaneously be ministered to them, and they will see the same vision
If we would do so, right away the Spirit would come to honor Christ and to wipe out our opinion and to heal us
Even among us the building has been going on very slowly, the growth is too slow, and the function is not so high
If you simply pray without taking Christ as your center, there's no base or ground for the Spirit to come in to kill your opinion
Spontaneously regardless of how many hundreds or thousands we may be we will still think the same thing because we will have the same vision
Lord, we stand on this fact to ask You to be one with our speaking, to be one with this meeting, and to be one with every attendant
We also saw that in order to apply the Spirit we need a clear vision that Christ has to be everything practically to us in the church life
Although we may say many things, we should not be offended by others who act or behave differently from what we say
Not only in the Old Testament but also in the New Testament there is the truth concerning calling on the Lord's name
They had the knowledge of Christ being everything, and to some extent they knew the Spirit in knowledge, but not in practice
If we have really seen that Christ is everything in the church life, we will not pay attention to anything else
If you cannot overcome your opinion over small things, you can never overcome your opinion over truths and doctrines
According to the strict teaching of the New Testament, only a few things are definitely condemned and renounced by the Lord
In addition to these three big matters, the New Testament also does not allow the denial of the deity of Christ
Toward other matters, such as the eating of the sacrifices offered to the idols, the Apostle Paul was very flexible
On the other hand some verses say that the sacrifices to the idols are nothing, and even the idol itself is nothing
When we come together to practice the church life, we must see that in the church life there is nothing but Christ
In other words they would be gained by Christ, gained to be more general and willing not to stand with their opinion
If he does have a strong vision that in the church life there is nothing but Christ, he will have a way to minister Christ to them
Because your vision is that Christ is everything, you don't need to be blind, and you don't need to say anything
We must practice this matter of seeing Christ as everything in the church life and of following the Spirit to overcome opinion
By these illustrations we can see that in order to kill opinion we must see a vision that Christ is everything in the church life
We need a vision to realize that Christ must be everything in the church life, and we also need to realize that we will always have opinion
The sisters talking or not talking may be considered as a kind of thermometer as to whether the opinions are killed in the church life
We may illustrate the problem of talking in this way: Our hands become dirty easily, even though we do not intentionally get them dirty
Our opinion could never be touched by the Lord unless we see such a vision-that Christ is everything in the church life
By the Lord's mercy, we have been enlightened to the extent that there is nearly no fighting and no debating among us
Although you may not have talked with a bad intention your talking still killed the growth in life the function and tore down the building
Believe me, if by His mercy we would not talk all this week, next week's meetings would be living, uplifted, and enriched
You must realize that among us at the present time there is such a need-that we all have to cast our stone at this one thing, opinion
Out of the nine hundred people who are here in this meeting, if only fifty percent could get into this vision, it would be marvelous
If you have really seen these matters, every time you take anything other than Christ, there will be a kind of condemnation within you
If you are humble open if you are poor in spirit with an attitude that you need the Lords mercy that you are nothing you will get the light
Sometimes, even many times, we do need to call out because some things are depressing us and suffocating us and attacking us
When you are filled in your spirit you will see that Christ is everything in God's economy and that you need to live Christ
We covered this matter in the Ephesians training, but our practice is that we only do the things we are used to
We need to practice this kind of speaking to one another, not in ordinary utterances, but in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
We need to sing and psalm with our heart to the Lord, giving thanks all the time for all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
Suppose you are such a person-filled up in your spirit and flushing out all the time-could you still have some opinion?
How can you have a condition that you are not apart from the Lord, a condition that you are filled from within with the Lord?
By this you can see it is altogether possible for you to pray without ceasing to pray unceasingly because praying has become your breathing
In other words when we have an opinion it is a strong proof that there is no filling up of the Lord as the Spirit
There may be five brothers praying in the elders' meeting, but there may be no aspiration and spirit of prayer
Although prayer is needed in the elders' meeting, the spirit of prayer, the aspiration of prayer, is needed even the more
In all kinds of meetings, whether the elders' meetings or service meetings, there should be an aspiration and spirit of prayer
When we come together we don't like to express our idea, our thought, our understanding-that means our opinion
We have to learn one thing: the accuracy of our interpretation of the Lord's leading depends upon the degree of self-denial
The more we get out of ourselves, the closer we will be to the real and accurate understanding of the Lord's leading
After a week or several weeks of prayer, however, the interpretation of the Lord's leading may be closer and closer
We have the Lord's leading because we have had much prayer, but the hidden and subtle self covers the clear understanding
It is not that the Lord has not revealed His leading to you, but that the covering self still remains in a subtle way
As you are filled with the Lord as the life-giving Spirit, the heavenly breath, you will be rescued and the self will be peeled off
At that time not only will we have no opinion but we will experience and realize the Lord Himself in our church life
You have the messages you have the knowledge you have the light you have the enlightenment the visions the revelations yet you may be off
You have to realize that up to the present time you have been strengthened and consolidated to be a strong embodiment of opinion
It seems that after a number of meetings awareness could be raised up within the saints concerning the opinion
In the beginning when we came to the church life we were young and we were still somewhat open and willing to be touched and changed
Now it's getting harder and harder for the Lord to really penetrate because there are more layers than ever before
We are aware of the need, but how to experience the peeling off of the self which is the very source of opinion is a real problem
We may even pray about it, but to have a very subjective light on our self in a particular way is quite another thing
Reasonably and logically it seems right to say that the light kills and that the more light we receive, the more self will be peeled off
Also, we have seen that when we abide in the Lord and let the Lord abide in us, we are not the self, or we are not the self at that time
When we have this kind of prayer, it is at the very moment our prayer is going on that our self is being peeled off
Whether you are a new convert or have been in the Lord a long time, if you don't pray, you are still in the self
Regardless of how many years they have been on the tree, once they are not abiding in the tree, they are dead branches
When the sisters who are single live together, they maintain a distance of politeness which hinders and frustrates their being exposed
Even if you were like Adam and lived over nine hundred years, yet you don't pray yourself into the spirit you will still be the flesh
The best book to tell us that we have been crucified with Christ must be Brother Nee's The Normal Christian Life
From 1922 to 1939 Brother Nee was continually ministering this kind of message which is contained in The Normal Christian Life
After 1939 he suddenly told us that the experience in Romans 6 could never be ours until we get into the Spirit in Romans 8
He said that the fact of being crucified with Christ could never become our experience until we get into Romans 8
Whether you have read through The Normal Christian Life or even a hundred books like that, or you have never read even one, it is the same
Regardless of how many messages you hear, how many books you read, or how much help you get, the self still remains
We have also seen that opinion is a great hindrance to the growth in life and also to the proper functioning in the church life
Every time that we are in the spirit, the self, or we may say the embodiment of the self, our opinion, is peeled off
They may not express it due to their experience or their disposition, but it does not mean that they have no opinion
When opinion comes out it causes damage to others, but when opinion doesn't come out and remains concealed in you, it damages you
In belief, you have to believe in the Lord, and you have to confess your sins and also confess His name; then you will be saved
The Chinese cooking is not to afford you a way to find fault; it is to afford you the whole fish for your eating
A man who was so opinionated criticized Brother Nee saying that the translation of the text of that verse was not accurate
If you can do this, it is a strong sign that you have been delivered from the custom, the habit, of being opinionated
There is a big factor, a negative factor, within you that has been frustrating you all the time from the richer experiences of Christ
We may have a lot of sins or no sins; we may have bad habits or good habits, but these are not the expressions of peculiarity
In the New Testament you can see that Paul is so strong, but you cannot find that with him there is something peculiar
It may be that this desire bothers him very much and that the only way to relieve this desire is to be humorous
The person we see in the meetings and the person whom we meet personally and particularly in a one-to-one relationship are very different
If a person is not that much in the spirit, it's quite easy to see something of his old man or his natural man
It is easy to see a kind of desire the person has that is somewhat short of the spirit or to see a kind of insecurity expressing itself
It may be that what we see are the symptoms that this brother is not that much transformed and not that much saturated with the Spirit
The root within him is not the joking; the root within him is the desire to be different from others and not common
Because we desire for people to appreciate us, to accept us, this causes us to live out our natural life rather than living out Christ
Because it is the expression of our natural man, and because we have lived with it so long, it is not easy to identify
Peculiarity separates us from others and even causes us to guard ourselves and protect ourselves so that we cannot be built with others
As we look into this matter we need to realize once more that our Christian life is nothing but for us to live Christ
You have to realize that verses like these are either missed by many Christians, or they are not cared for, or they are misinterpreted
By these two verses we can see that the Apostle Paul lived a life not for anything else, but simply to live Christ
We have to realize that, according to our limited experience, the most hidden thing that frustrates us from living Christ is peculiarity
We have to look into this matter of peculiarity from this unique angle: God's intention is to work Christ into us
The most hidden thing, the most secret thing, the most subtle thing, that almost occupies us in full, is our peculiarity
You cannot pin it down, and you cannot identify it, but within you have an inner sensation, an inner realization, concerning the peculiarity
For us in the Lord's recovery it is not so easy to tell a lie or to commit some sins or to do something so apparently in the flesh
In the meetings the brothers and sisters have seen his manifested peculiarity, but probably not many of you know his concealed peculiarity
Although his wife may behave herself in such a nice way that you can hardly find anything to break, surely peculiarity is there
The only way that you can discover your peculiarity is to notice that over the years you have been short of Christ
Their human living has no doubt improved very much, but as far as Christ in them is concerned, the territory has been reduced
If we have no vision concerning our ugly, bothering peculiarity, the time will come that the territory of Christ within us will be reduced
Many bad habits are reduced as the years go by, but we have to realize that as we grow older our peculiarity will increase and develop
At the beginning of your Christian life or of your church life you had a lot of improvement and a lot of growth
You gave Christ more and more place, but after a certain time the territory of Christ in your Christian life stopped being enlarged
If you consider that a certain person is peculiar, it must be that his peculiarity is not so subtle because it is very apparent
No doubt all the unbelievers are antichrist, but even we the believers who are the lovers of Christ have within us an antichrist
According to my observations, the Christians who have the strongest peculiarity are those who are the most 'spiritual'
From reading many biographies you can discover a principle: some of the lives in these biographies end with that person's peculiarity
If you are living something that you cannot designate, that you cannot name, you have to realize that is peculiarity
Now you do live something-not sin, not worldliness, not lust, not flesh, not disposition-but not Christ either
You cannot live Christ as long as you have your peculiarity, and you cannot have the proper Body life as long as you have your peculiarity
According to the human educational system, there is the need of altogether sixteen years to finish a university degree
Without passing through the sixteen years it is hard for anyone to understand the things up to the level of university graduation
If you don't grow or if you don't have growth, this training will mean nothing to you, and you will get nothing
They have been meeting with the saints in the Name and on the ground of oneness, but after so many years it seems they have nothing to do
These have been mainly from Paul's Epistles, from other books of the New Testament, and from the Old Testament
We have the Life-studies of Matthew, John, Romans, Galatians, Philippians, Ephesians, Colossians, Hebrews, Revelation, and others
Besides these we have messages which were given on the Psalms eleven years ago concerning Christ and the church
I'm very sorry to say that, in spite of so many messages being given, with some of the dear saints there is not much growth
We all have to admit after a certain number of years in the recovery, our advance, our progress, our growth has become quite slow
Even the angels would say that the recovery in the United States is much stronger and richer than it was seventeen years ago
If you haven't grown in life and if you don't have some amount of building, you would not go along with the gospel preaching
The peculiarity eats up your experience of Christ, and without the experience of Christ, there is no way for you to be built up
The pastoring of many pastors is not the real feeding, but a kind of organizing just to get a proper link with people
A surgeon may know how to cut on your leg or your nose, but he may have no way to deal with a particular part of your heart
Although you may not drop the church life and you may not stay home, you come to the meeting without any kind of meaning
You might have missed your meal, but you would not have missed the meeting because it was so meaningful to you
Thank the Lord that in His mercy and grace through the church you have been edified, so it's hard for you to go back to sin
Although you would not go back to sin, and you would not go back to the world, to stay in the church life becomes tasteless to you
You have to pray that the Lord would have mercy upon you, that you would have a clear vision of the stronghold within you
In the first stage of our Christian experience sin and the world did hold us back from the experience of Christ, but not now
You would even allow God to save you from your bad temper, but you would not allow Him to save you from your peculiarity
Up to this point you have been saved from sin, from the world, and from so many other things, yet you do not live by this Christ
You may have had much improvement in contacting the brothers in dealing with your wife in your attitude toward your relatives and so forth
You have been in the church life; you have listened to all the messages; you have been edified; but now what can you do?
Right away the church life will become tasteful to you, and you will feel a burden with so many things and so many needs
Under this kind of situation where you feel you are jobless and useless with no interest and no taste, even your prayer is not tasteful
You would not agree with the church administration, and you would not agree with the way so many things are done
The actual situation is that you are jobless, useless, and you don't feel anything in the church life is so tasteful
Although we want to open ourselves heart-to-heart, you must realize it is very dangerous and risky to know a person's inner condition
If you have learned some spiritual lessons, you will realize that to know others' situation is a snare of the enemy
If you consider your experience you will realize that when you are down spiritually, you like to know others' situation
When you are up, you don't like to know; you don't have the heart, you don't have the intention, you don't have the desire to know
If you have learned some spiritual lessons, whenever one comes to you trying to open up his inner secrets, you would avoid it
Although these are simple words, we all have to realize nothing is more crucial in the Bible than these two points
If you check your spiritual situation with the living of Christ and the building of the Body, you surely would not be satisfied
You may be overcoming, holy, and 'spiritual,' and yet not have much experience in living Christ and in the building up of the Body
The frustrating factor within you that keeps you from living Christ and from being built up in the Body is simply your peculiarity
In the Life-studies we have pointed out three books in the New Testament which reveal things either replacing Christ or opposing Christ
It is not secular or sinful knowledge but spiritual knowledge, scriptural knowledge, fundamental knowledge, and gifts
In Colossians we saw that culture and many isms such as Judaism, Gnosticism, asceticism, were replacing Christ
As the church life is going on year after year, our peculiarity is becoming stronger and stronger and stronger
By the Lord's mercy we have been preserved and held together by His grace, by the ground of oneness, and by the truth
We thank Him for this, yet we all have to admit that within us this hidden factor is still undermining and restricting us from living Christ
You need to see that the reason you don't live Christ so much and you're not built up so much is your peculiarity
We are here keeping the ground of genuine oneness, yet within us there is a factor keeping us from being built up
In the early days of your church life you were useful, but in the latter days of your church life you just become useless
Lord, lead us on and grant us the liberty and the freedom in fellowship that we may utter something out of You
Either in the way of a testimony or realization or analysis, tell us your feeling concerning this kind of training
What we have seen in this Perfecting Meeting is that at a certain point there are elements in our being that become a kind of frustration
These were the three things that Brother Lee observed and presented to us in the very beginning of these meetings
It seems that we have been growing in the Lord's recovery, but we have come to a point that we are frustrated in this matter
Because of the shortage of growth in life, there is the lack of the real and solid building up among the saints in the churches
Although at first we thought this might be the depth of our problem, later we found out even that was still superficial
We have not realized it is there, and we do not know what it is, but it is there all the time resisting Christ
In the last Perfecting Training he made a statement that it's risky to be in the church life and not grow in Christ
In no other book or books are Christ and His Body, the church, so thoroughly, adequately, and richly revealed to us
We cannot deny that we have seen something concerning Christ as the mystery of God and concerning the church as the mystery of Christ
We cannot deny this, yet my burden is that still too little of what we have seen has become our real daily experience
On the one hand we do not live Christ, and on the other hand the issue of our daily life is not much for the building of the Body of Christ
In our practical daily life we do not have much Christ, and our daily life does not issue much in the Body of Christ
You have to check how much of Christ is there in your daily life, and how much of the building of the Body has issued out of your daily life
In other words everything is fine and everything is good, but Christ is very lacking and the building up of the Body of Christ is lacking
We may be Christian brothers standing on the proper ground, meeting together into the name of the Lord, and handling some spiritual things
If you don't have such a desperate seeking within you, these meetings will simply disappoint you again and again
Not only do you sisters live yourself when you are cooking, even when you talk with people about the Bible you live yourself
Not how much has He gained you out of the world or out of sin or out of self, but how much has He gained you to live Him?
Many of you have been with the Lord for years, but if you check your daily life in this way, you will discover there is not much Christ
Although in the brothers' houses or the sisters' houses there may not be much gossip, yet neither is there much Christ
Do you think God would be satisfied with the perfect human life without Christ in it or with Christ in it only a little bit?
In no other book of the Bible is the writer so serious as Paul is in those four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians
Although some may have been offended by this, this is not my speaking; this is the study of Revelation chapters two and three
You may consider that others are Laodicea, but you have to realize that you yourself might be also in Laodicea
The charismatic Christians may speak about speaking in tongues, healing, the lengthening of the legs, or other things
In the past most of my confession was concerning wrongdoing, but now most of my confession is concerning the lacking of Christ
We may not have a very specific definition of what our peculiarity is, but we do have the realization that all of us are peculiar
It is a kind of blockade or a kind of frustration in our being that just keeps the Lord as our person from living out of us
Regardless of how much your wife is submissive and how much she loves you, if you touch her living of herself she will react
It is because when they reach eighteen, they are like birds out of a cage; they have the freedom to live themselves
You may have condemned yourself that you didn't live Christ, but probably you have never condemned yourself that you live yourself
According to the context of the verse which says that we need to pray unceasingly, we should not quench the Spirit
It is not to pray unceasingly for your business affairs, for good food, for good blessings, for this, or for that
Every day, every hour, every minute, even every second, in whatever you are doing, you must practice the living of Christ
If they were to miss three days of practice, an expert could tell from their playing that they had missed the practice
The problem is, although we have known this for several years, and we know we should exercise our spirit, we don't
Although the Apostle Paul never told us that he was not successful, his writings indicate that he was not absolutely mature in this matter
Question: It seems as though sometimes when you try to live Christ, you don't and at other times spontaneously you just live Christ
Is that only a kind of outward working upon us, or is there still the aspect of being saturated and permeated with the Lord?
When we practice living Christ, no doubt we give the Lord much ground and much opportunity to change our being
If you would practice and continue to practice, the Lord will gradually do something to transform your natural, raw, and wild being
Question Brother Lee would you share more to guide us so that our practice may not turn into a form of selfimprovement or a kind of behavior
In the Song of Songs the seeker became so desperate that she only knew one person, and she was only seeking after that one person
We need to change the subject of the Perfecting Training from the matter of peculiarity to the matter of habit
According to my experience the hardest thing is to get into the habit to live Christ and to practice the one spirit with Him
Because seemingly there is nothing sinful and there is nothing wrong if you don't practice the one spirit with the Lord
It doesnt mean whenever you pray you need to do these things it means that at every time you need to pray even every minute you have to pray
Although you may have the knowledge concerning the church, without praying unceasingly you cannot have the church life
The church life does not remain with your knowledge it remains with your praying even with your continual and persistent prayer all the time
We may have a lot of knowledge, a lot of revelation concerning the Body, but this does not mean we can have the church life
The ultimate and consummate conclusion of all the charges in the Bible is that we need to live Christ and walk in the spirit
There is no other way that we can live Christ continually, and there is no other way that we can walk in spirit
Although you may not have been successful to such an extent, still you had the desire and the hunger and the thirst to pray
Practice this yourself, and eventually you will be a good coach to help so many into this kind of praying life
We have now come definitely to a very crucial point, that is, for us to live Christ we must practice the one spirit with Him
Thessalonians 5:17 says we should pray without ceasing, and Ephesians 6:18 says that we should pray at every time
We need two brothers to represent all the trainees and to tell us what they have learned concerning this matter during the past seven days
Such expressions as 'to live Christ' or 'Christ lives in me' are only used in the heart of the divine revelation
In the other writings of the New Testament such as Peter's writings and James', there is not such an expression
In his mending ministry he once more picked up this expression which was used by Paul in his completing ministry
In the divine revelation of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the climax, the top point, is nothing but to live Christ
In eternity we will not live for Christ only, but we will live Christ, Our eternal job will be just to live Christ
Eventually even with the Apostle Paul, God's sovereignty put him in prison where he could do nothing but live Christ
In the mending ministry which is much richer and stronger than the completing ministry, there is such a chapter as John 15
Two years ago a small peach tree was planted in my back yard, and this morning, to my surprise, a small peach was on a branch
According to our physical life we could understand and we could see a full illustration that to live is simply to breathe
As you talk with your wife and your children you must exercise this habit Lord is this just myself speaking or are You speaking with me
You have to come back to this point: you must do all things by talking to the Lord, by praying to Him, by calling on Him
We have gone on to see that not only do we need to pray before doing, but even while we are doing something, at that time we need to pray
The book of Exodus has forty chapters; Leviticus has twenty-seven; Numbers has thirty-six; and Deuteronomy has thirty-four
After speaking to Moses it may be that the Lord spoke to over forty different people in different places at different times
Paul had written something in Galatians 2:20 about thirty-five years before John wrote something in his Gospel
In the New Testament, according to all the words and experiences, you surely can see there is a way demonstrated and presented to us
God created us in His image and after His likeness because He wants to work Himself into us to be our life and to be our nature
Through Christ passing through so many processes, He has entered into our being and made us one spirit with Him
He first becomes our life, and He wants to travel through three things-our nature, our disposition, and our character-to become our living
Life is different from nature, and nature is different from disposition, and disposition is different from character
The life implies the nature, and the nature implies the disposition, and the disposition expresses the character
When he wrote the Gospel of John and the book of Revelation you can hardly find any trace of the old disposition
There are four people with such a history that God became mans life mans nature mans disposition mans character and mans daily living
Now you understand what it means to pray unceasingly-it is to keep yourself plugged into that heavenly current
The New Testament says pray unceasingly, pray continually, pray at every time, and pray at every time in spirit
If you are a person giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, surely you are a person praying
Thousands of Christians have sung this hymn, but few have ever practiced praising their Savior all the day long
Nearly everyone who speaks at a wedding would say something so sweet, so pleasant, so colorful, and so full of scenery
The marriage life may not be that straight, not that colorful, not that pleasant, not with so many beautiful pictures
It's not that difficult to be a teacher or a nurse or an electrician, but to be a wife needs the whole universe to sustain you
To be a wife you need the Triune God to be in you as your life, your nature, your disposition, your character, your daily living
If you don't have the Triune God to be your life, nature, disposition, character, and living, you can never be a proper wife
Colossians says, 'In everything, whatever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God'
The way to live Christ is to plug yourself into the Word, into the prayer, and into the singing, the praising, the psalming all the day long
The antenna wire is in us, in our spirit, and the ground wire is in our hand; we just need to remain here with these two wires
The Bible could be living to you only when you breathe it when you pray it when you praise it when you singread it when you psalmread it
You will get the transmission, the transfusion, the permeation, making Him everything to you and making you one with Him
You may know this and you may know that concerning the matter of life, but knowledge doesn't work out anything for the matter of life
Through all the years in the Lord's recovery, the Lord has shown us that His intention is just to be our life that we may live Him
By this you can see that many prayers have become a trap to you, trapping you to do something apart from the living One
Apart from Him we can pray, we can read the Bible, we can preach the gospel, we can do everything in today's Christian religion
All of the ordinary things you can do and you have done a lot yet you never realized that all these are traps used by the enemy to trap you
If you are not abiding in Him, prayer is a trap; if you are not abiding in Him, even reading the Bible is a trap
Many Christians only care for the knowledge of the doctrines; they don't care for the substantial, genuine experience of a living Person
At the end of the last century and the beginning of this century it may be that Andrew Murray was one of the top among the inner life people
Even to read the Bible, to pay attention to the Bible, to know the Bible, and to collect knowledge from the Bible may be traps
Titus 2:13 says, 'Awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus'
Four titles the great God our Savior Christ and Jesus are compounded together to be a long titlethe great God and our Savior Christ Jesus
One school says this title indicates two persons; the great God, that is, the Father, and our Savior Christ Jesus, the Son
The Concordant Version, the Wuest translation, and the New American Standard Version all put a comma in that place
Concerning the Trinity, many like to systematize the Father away from the Son and to systematize the Son away from the Father
Some have even said that to abide in Christ and to let Christ abide in us simply indicates a kind of intimate relationship
Three hundred years ago people spoke of the spirit as a kind of instrument, a kind of power, a kind of channel
He passed through creation, through incarnation, He lived on this earth, He passed through crucifixion, and He entered into resurrection
Of course you need your mind, but you have to realize the Bible is not a kind of human, secular, worldly writing
Ephesians and Colossians say that we need to receive the Word of God by means of all prayer and petition, even praying at every time
Last, He wants us to take Him in through the Word and the Spirit by praying, by singing, by psalming, and by thanking
If we would practice this all the day long we wouldn't need to talk about living Christ; spontaneously we would live Christ
When you are infused and permeated with Him, you are actually one with Him, and you are practically one spirit with Him
In the last meeting we pointed out that all the Christian doings and practices eventually all in all have become a kind of trap
Some would ask: Isn't it good enough that people go to the mission field to bring the name of the Lord to the heathen?
Isn't it good that someone would sacrifice their country, their family-everything-to tell heathen people the name of Jesus?
Although our experiences in these matters may be limited and shallow, yet we can testify this is the right way to live Christ
In our daily lives we live according to habit, and this habit is a current carrying us away from living Christ
Sometimes they may have some good news or bad news to talk about, but at other times they may hunt for some material to talk about
You talk concerning that sister being weak and that brother being sick and that church not being good and another church being pitiful
You don't need to tell people that a certain church is pitiful, even you don't need to say that a certain church is wonderful
Our habitual living is a kind of trend, a kind of current, a kind of downhill current, carrying us away from Christ unconsciously
On the one hand to see some practical light in this way is a pleasant thing, but on the other hand it is not a pleasant thing
In our home we will sing and pray, and when we see each other and come together, we will sing, pray-read and psalm together
If we would drop our habitual living, all the sinful things will be gone; all the negative things will be gone
If you want to know something concerning a certain brother, you go to that desk, and you can get the full information
The Texas brothers have their habit, the California brothers have their habit, and some particular ones have their particular habit
If we don't live Christ, although we may minister Christ to people for the church life, there will not be much reality
Be assured that one day the Lord will open your eyes, and you will see a wide gap, a deep gap, that only mercy can bridge
Right away in the first meeting you shared with us that you realized something among us needed to be operated on
In the past months we have covered a number of negative things: culture, opinion, peculiarity, Christianity traps, and habit
If you check with the experiences of Christians today, you may realize that very, very few Christians live Christ
You are the employer and He is the employee to help you accomplish the employer's business, that is, to live Christ
Of course they dared not say that it was a divine self, but they were bold to say that it was a holy, spiritual, heavenly self
It is to perfect you in one matter: that Christ will really live in you and that the church will be your practical living of Christ
Small germs are easy to kill, but it is hard for you to kill the big, the strong, the covered, the concealed germs
Their arrogance and their pride are spreading a kind of smoke to cloud the entire situation to make their sight so foggy
Paul used this word for predicting the degradation and decline of the church and also for the dealing with the decline of the church
Week after week we put out three to four messages, yet we don't have enough pages to cover all the positive things of Christ
We would not manage in reading the Bible: we would not manage in prayer; even in living Christ we would not manage
You have a schedule that tells you how many chapters you would read a day and how many messages you would read a week
You have to realize while you are having a strong schedule, you need to be unloaded and released from your schedule
The past nine months of the Perfecting Training have helped you enter into a strong decision or a strong practice to live Christ
We need to read Acts 2:40: 'And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation'
Both the English language and the Chinese language have active and passive voice, but neither has an active-passive voice
In human culture there is not such a thing as active-passive, but in God's economy active-passive is too great a matter
The problem is this: as fallen human beings, either we wouldn't care for our salvation, or we would do everything to save ourselves
Some might testify that they got saved thoroughly because they cried for two nights and fasted for three meals
A kind of joy came to them, but it was a joy created by themselves because they had been crying for two nights and fasting for three meals
You may consider that you like to live Christ and because you can't make it, you need to fast, and you need to pray
When the tongues didn't come, they told people to turn their jaw and to exercise their tongue; then a tongue came
It doesn't work until one day you don't care for the practice of the one spirit, nor do you care for not practicing the one spirit
Tell the Lord that you love Him, that you want everything of Him, but that you would not do anything, that the Lord must do it
Some needs will not be met today, but after six months you would remember what you heard, and you would receive the help
Compared to the big traps these are much better, but compared to the proper and wonderful situation of living Christ, these are frustrations
You will find that a spontaneous living will come out of you, not by your determination and not by your kind of definite mind or strong will
In that book you can see that step after step the seeker of the Lord was gradually delivered from her own energy in seeking after the Lord
The horse in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, signifies the natural strength that belongs to the world
In the Song of Songs there is a clear picture showing us that the more we grow, the more we lose our character
At first the Lord gave in a little bit, but after chapter two the Lord stopped giving in, so she couldn't find the Lord
The Lord trained her and disciplined her to give up her commands and her direction and to pick up the Lord's direction
One day when we received the mercy of the Lord, we repented, we believed in the Lord, and we called on Him, and we received Him
If today you are a big horse and tomorrow morning you become a dove, surely this means you have been limited and reduced
Over the years they have been touched by the Lord, they have been reduced by the Lord, they have been stopped by the Lord repeatedly
The really experienced Christians after many years have learned one lesson: the Lord only wants you to have a heart
Gradually your doing will be reduced until one day you know that what the Lord wants of you is absolutely not your doing
Spontaneously, the Lord will act in you; He will live in you; He will do everything for you; and He will do everything with you
It will take you a long time to reach the point where you realize you don't need to love because the Lord lives in you
They prayed that they would never have a long face toward their wives, but that they would always be smiling and never lose their temper
Eventually all the brothers have the experience to testify that on the whole earth there is not such a husband
If you keep on this track some day you will reach a point by the Lords growing within you that your being your person will be calmed down
As you grow in life you will reach a point that you may be in prayer for twenty minutes with the Lord, but have nearly no prayer
The Lord must reduce all your spiritual doings, your good doings, even your doings for the seeking after the Lord
It may seem at the time that you are not on fire, but actually you do have a thorough mingling of the Lord with you
We may be foolish, and we may waste a lot of time, but the Lord is not foolish, and He has never wasted our time
For right now, we have to realize that on the one hand the Lord is growing within us, and on the other hand He is reducing us
You must realize that you dont need to pray that much and you dont need to love people that much and you dont need to endeavor that much
In the New Testament many points like this have been either translated in the wrong way or understood in the wrong way
In the New Testament we are told not to be something, not to do something, but to be saved , to be empowered , and that we may be sanctified
When we began this Perfecting Training we realized that many of you have been in the experience of Christ for years
We surely realized that many of you are bothered because your old way of experiencing Christ in the past no longer works
According to my experience nothing pleases the Lord so much as for us to realize that He doesn't want us to do anything
God's intention was to create a vessel to contain Him and to express Him, so God only wants an opening of the vessel
We would think according to our natural religious concepts that the worship of idols or witchcraft, these demonic things, are abominable
We all have to realize that in our fallen nature there is a substance so evil that likes to know and likes to do
Once their eyes are 'open' they would consider, and they would not let things go on in the church life in a certain way
If you look into these two groups you may say that the summary of these fourteen Epistles may be expressed in just two words: open vessel
The processed God-the Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound Spirit-is here waiting for an opening to get into you
It is really hard to have a person on the one hand absolutely open to the Lord and on the other hand, doing nothing
In the first, to Ephesus, the Lord said that they did so many things for Him and yet they had lost their first love
In the fourth letter, to Thyatira, the Lord also indicated that He knew their works and love and faith and service and endurance
You have to realize that if you love the church but do not open yourself up absolutely, you will still love to do something for the Lord
If you take this as a key and read once again the Epistles written by Paul, you will see that this is the genuine substance in his Epistles
Even you may give people the impression that you need to go and pray so that after prayer you will know what God wants you to do
They would ask how so many thousands of missionaries could go to the foreign field without this kind of motivating prayer
You have to realize that the deeper prayer, the more genuine prayer, always calms you down and kills every bit of your activity
The problem among today's Christians is either there is no motivation or there is a lot of motivation with no nailing to the cross
A virgin in the eyes of the Lord is not one who is so busy and so active in doing, but one who keeps himself open to receive the oil
Many Christian workers travel through certain churches to stir people up either to go to the mission field or to open their pocketbook
They always encourage people to go and pray concerning going to the mission field and pray concerning opening their pocketbook
If your function is natural and not really out of the resurrection life, your genuine prayer will kill your function
Many seeking saints through the centuries were first very active and eventually became very calm through their genuine prayers
You just need to love Him and to keep yourself open to Him, giving Him every opportunity to do everything He wants to do
If you really get into the Bible to see what is revealed as an underlying line, it is this: you are a vessel created by God
Without the Lord filling you as a vessel to work out something from within you, your whole being is a peculiarity
You will be a living vessel absolutely calmed down so that your Master has the absolute free course to fill you up
O Lord Jesus, in this dark age You have captured us, and You have put us together to come together all the time for Your Word
Lord, come again to visit every one tonight and reach every one and touch every one and grant every one Your grace
We again realize that this is a fighting for Your recovery and for Your testimony, so hide us and fight the war for us
We know that the Bible has sixty-six books and that they were written over a period of at least sixteen hundred years
Bible students and Bible teachers have picked up a lot of subjects from the Bible, but we all have to see that the Body is the top point
You have to realize that the most missed and neglected and lost point in the Bible is that the church is the Body of Christ
In the last two years we have stressed very strongly that Paul's ministry is the completing ministry to complete the divine revelation
Suppose you remove not all the writings of Paul, but only Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians from the Bible
The heavens were produced, the earth was produced, man was produced, and even thousands of items were produced
The Body is the ultimate item of God's continual working, so the Body is the top point of God's entire revelation
Although this book talks a lot about these ten problems it doesnt talk about a particular positive thing that is the Body in chapter twelve
Today many teachers and expositors of the Bible talk a lot about other points, but they don't talk about the Body
Even in the book of Acts, which is very much related to the establishment of the church, there is no mention of the Body
Even as the four Gospels show us one person from four different angles, so these four books view the Body from four different directions
Many teachers talk about Romans 12, but hardly one would tell you that Romans 12 talks about the Body from the angle of the organic union
Confucius taught meekness, humility, and kindness, but he never touched the organic union with Christ that we all may become the Body
We all have to realize the Body of Christ is altogether a matter of life that keeps us in an organic union with Christ
It is not so good to turn it around and say that the warrior is the Body or that the house is the Body or that the new man is the Body
Matthew is a part; Mark is a part; both Luke and John are parts of the biography of the Son of God, Jesus Christ
The channel, which is His Body, through which He continues His ministry from the heavens on the earth, needs twenty-two books to define it
I'm sorry to say that perhaps not one of so many teachers has ever said what is the ultimate focus of the book of Romans
Most of the Bible students and teachers would consider that the main subject of the book of Romans is justification by faith
At least there is one book with one verse which says that justification is not only by faith, but also by works
The journey begins from the first station of justification; it passes through sanctification to reach the Body
If you miss the Body you dont have the center of the Christian life you dont have the goal you dont have the aim you dont have any direction
The strange thing is that none of these teachers pointed out that the way to walk as a believer must be firstly to live in the Body
If you read Romans 12:1-5 carefully, you can see that the purpose of consecration is so that you can realize the Body
When the Bible was being translated into the Chinese language, this term, 'in Christ,' bothered the translators to the uttermost
No doubt this expression strongly indicates that there is a kind of organic union, which spontaneously implies mingling
When you put tea into water, could you say that the tea abides in the water just in a kind of union without mingling?
To find out the supports of a focal point in a certain book, you have to take care of the context of the entire book
Many teachers have stressed that we are baptized into His death but they have not stressed adequately that we have been baptized into Christ
Verse 6 says that 'the mind set on the spirit is life and peace,' and verse 10 says that 'the spirit is life because of righteousness'
In the Life-study of Romans we pointed out that these verses in chapter eight reveal four layers of the matter of life
If we could have this kind of life, this kind of vision, of the Body we will be able to enter into the practical Body life
In this meeting, we need to touch another crucial point in Romans which is basically related to the Body of Christ
Even we ourselves had the Life-study Training of Romans, and over the years we have put out sixty-five messages on this book
After justification by faith there is the matter of the organic union, because there is such a phrase as, 'unto justification of life'
In reading the Bible you may first touch the surface, but then you need to dive into that part and get to the bottom
In every chapter of the Bible there are these two aspects: the aspect of the surface and the aspect of the depth
When you come to the Bible and you read any chapter which has this term, the Spirit, it is easy for you to see
Verse 6 points out that the life of the Spirit spreads into our mind and in verse 11 it even saturates our mortal body
The Spirit within us witnesses with our spirit, not that we are the sons of God, but that we are the children of God
You are walking according to Spirit, yet you discover while you are walking according to the Spirit, you would not be led by Him
He uses all things working together for you to transform you and to change you from a son of Adam to a son of God
Because whom He foreknew He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers
In Matthew 16 the Lord asked Peter who He was, and Peter answered that the Lord was the Christ, the Son of the living God
The Head of Christ is the firstborn Son of God, and all the members of the Body of Christ are the many sons of God
Although some have not experienced the redemption of their body, yet they have been reconstituted to a certain extent
When we will have been reconstituted to a certain extent, our body will be fully under the control of the reconstitution
The body will not play that much role in our daily life and our fleshly body will not exercise too much influence over our Christian walk
It is not just a matter of consecration; it is a matter of the full control and the full subduing of your body
The Son of God is the expression of the Father, the divine life, and we are the many sons; so we also are the expression of the divine life
Far, from the book of Romans we have picked up two main points: the organic union and the sonship for the Body of Christ
When you talk about presenting your body in chapter twelve, you have to go back to see what kind of body you have
In many revival meetings an altar call may be given based upon Romans twelve, exhorting people to present their body
God's commandment says that you should not be covetous, but when you try not to be covetous, something is within you weakening you
Once the phone call comes, something within you rises up to energize your tired body to talk on the phone for a long time
After Romans 6 which mentions the body of sin, and after Romans 7 which mentions the body of death, you come to chapter eight
Whether sin is energizing your body or whether death is weakening your body, the practices of your body have to be put to death
It says if you live according to flesh you are about to die, but then it says you need to put to death the practices of the body
Once you realize that your body is a body of sin and death, you would groan and you would earnestly expect for your body to be redeemed
Once you realize that you have a body that can do nothing to please God, you would groan and you would expect to be redeemed
Paul did not say that our body needs to be put to death, but that the practices of our body need to be put to death
We have to realize that a kind of salvation has been infused and transfused into our being, that is, the indwelling Spirit
Whenever your body wants to practice something, you have to turn to your spirit and let the indwelling Spirit do something
In the last message we mentioned that there is a difference between walking according to the Spirit and being led by the Spirit
The difference is this: to walk according to the Spirit is somewhat general, but to be led by the Spirit is very specific
The Bible doesnt ask you to deal with your body but rather with every activity of the body every practice of the body by the Spirits leading
When you deal with every practice of the body, every activity of the body, that is actually to be led by the Spirit
Sometimes even if you try to be quiet, the wife would somewhat be used to stir up the practices of your body to speak something
Regardless of how much you walk according to the Spirit, you have to kill every practice of the body by being led by the indwelling Spirit
If you don't kill the practice of exchanging unpleasant words with your wife, this means you remain in your childhood
If, by the Spirit, you kill one practice of the body after another, it is a sign that you are no more a child but a growing son
If you present to God a body which is fully occupied by many items, there is no room for God to come in to use you
He may present such a busy body to go to the mission field to do some mission work for God, but actually that is not a real service to God
The proper presenting of your body is a matter of presenting a body that is unemployed, that has been fired, that has lost every employment
We have to be led by the Spirit daily to such an extent that we have no practice of the body apart from being led by the Spirit
For nearly nineteen hundred years the Lord has been unable to have the practical and actual Body life in an adequate way
Far we have covered the matter of the organic union, the sonship, and now the unemployed body, a body that is good for us to present to God
Romans 87 reads Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can it be
Because gambling and drinking and stealing and striking others are sinful things, you should put them to death
Whether your practicing body is the flesh or not does not depend upon whether the things you practice are evil or moral
Let us also read verse 9: 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
Many times, although we have the Spirit within us, the Spirit doesn't reside in us and doesn't have His home in us
When you indeed have the Spirit of God residing in you, making His home in you, it is then that you are in the spirit and not in the flesh
There is the third kind of person, that is, a saved one who is also in the spirit, having the Spirit of God residing in him
A brother may be sick and yet have the Spirit of God in him, even residing in his entire body and in his entire being
You are not only spiritual in your spirit and not only spiritual in your mind, but also spiritual in your body
In order to understand whose mortal body receives life in verse 11, we must consider the modifiers in verses 9 and 10
In the last message we stressed the point of the Spirit dwelling in you, but in this message we would stress Christ being in you
Eventually there will be a distinction within you where you realize that your spirit is not only living but it is life yet your body is dead
When you have this distinction, by experience you can know so clearly that your body is just a dead thing and your spirit is life
When a person who has a talent in singing enters into the distinction between the dead body and the spirit being life, she wouldn't sing
In a sense, the 'you' should be common, but due to today's degradation among Christians, such a 'you' is not common
In the Old Testament all the firstfruits from the land had to go to God, not to work anything for God, but just to satisfy God
He is not only the firstborn Son to His flesh mother, but He is also the firstborn Son in resurrection to God to satisfy God
The Spirit is the Spirit of life which is involved with God, with our spirit, with our soul, and with our body
It is a kind of groaning, with a kind of eager expectation that our body could be redeemed and have the full sonship
As to His Person, He is revealed first as the Spirit of something, and then He is revealed as being the Spirit of two Persons
We need to realize that the Spirit of God is basic, and the Spirit of Christ is even more basic, that is, basic in what He has gone through
From creation He has gone through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement
If you are still living in an age 'praising God,' you have to realize that is the Old Testament age, the Jewish age
When He comes today in the new age to be with us, He is no more merely the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of Christ
The Spirit today works, not in a way of falling upon us nor by the way of inspiration, but by the way of indwelling
His way of working is not a matter of His coming upon us or a matter of inspiration, but a silent, mysterious yet excellent indwelling
The work of the indwelling Spirit is of three categories to impart life to our mortal body to slay the practices of our body and to lead us
Rather he says He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you
Some condemn us because we stress experience so much, but if you are going to understand spiritual things, you surely need the experiences
Suppose you consider that since the indwelling Spirit is within you working, He bears every responsibility and takes care of everything
Without God, you don't have the life-working Spirit, and of course without the life-working Spirit, you don't have God
Not only does God impart life through the Spirit but you also must do something through the Spirit you must slay the practices of your body
We all have the Spirit indwelling us, but not many do have the practical and actual enjoyment of the firstfruit of the Spirit
At that point you will realize you still have such a body, dragging you away, pulling you off, distracting and bothering you
Finally, you have to realize that in Romans 6, 7, 8, and also 12 the main part of our being which is dealt with is our body
Lord, do subdue our will and sober our mind, and, Lord, give us a clear spirit, so open to You and to one another
Now the problem is, as we spend more time to dig out some of the points of Romans 8, we eventually discover more problems
They have different interpretations of whether this word, pneuma, denotes God's Spirit or whether it denotes our spirit
With a few verses-unless the Apostle Paul were with us-no one could answer in a definite way whether it should be God's Spirit or our spirit
Verse 4 says That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh but according to spirit
Why do we dare to say that in the same verse the first spirit denotes our spirit and the second spirit denotes God the Spirit?
If the verse read But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit of God if He indeed dwells in you it would clearly denote the Spirit of God
Now verse 10: 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
The sonship is not the sonship of the Son of God but the sonship of the son of man because the spirit of the sonship here is a human spirit
The parallel verse, Galatians 4:6, says, 'And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts'
In other words, we do not have only the Spirit of the Son of God, but we have even our spirit which has been sonized
Not only have very few gone through Romans 8 to Romans 12, I'm afraid very few have even entered into Romans 8
Many Christians are praying for some leading or for some kind of inspiration, but neglect the fact that the Spirit is dwelling in them
It doesn't mean that because you are humble, meek, patient, nice, loving, or forbearing that you are in the Body
Do you believe that whenever the law of gravity operates, it needs God to operate it again and again and again?
If you are afraid of offending someone, you had better close your doors and windows and then do the crying and the groaning
You have to realize that these two spirits with the three facts, altogether five matters, take care of the installation and the operation
You may say that you are waiting for God, but God is right here and has been waiting for two thousand years already
What a blessing to hear that we need to walk, to have our daily life, to live, to move, to act, to have our being according to the spirit
If you then told them that we don't need an inspiration, that we have the indwelling, they would probably consider that you are heretical
When you walk according to the spirit, set your mind upon the spirit, and put to death the practices of the body, you are led
After experiencing all these six items, we would realize what a poor situation there is among today's Christians
We don't know what to say, but we have a certain kind of sensation within us concerning God's interest on the earth today
If we are such persons experiencing all these seven items, surely the law of the Spirit of life is setting us free
For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father'
One of these verses says that we cry Abba, Father, and the other says the Spirit, meaning the Holy Spirit, cries Abba, Father
Galatians 4:6 tells us that the Spirit of God, the Third of the Godhead, becomes the Spirit of the Second of the Godhead
Not only can you not divide Christ from the Spirit, but you also should not separate the Holy Spirit from your spirit
Even in the matter of being led by the Spirit as mentioned in verse 14, it is a matter of the human spirit with the Holy Spirit
By this you can see that few Christians today actually understand the Spirit's leading because they don't know they have a spirit
You have some concept concerning life, and you also have some idea concerning the Spirit, so it is easy for you to pick up these matters
We have the law of God given outwardly, and surely as a human being created by God, we would like to keep the law of God
Between these two lawsthe law given by God and the law created in us in our natural lifethere is another evil law which is also called evil
Romans 8 says that there is no condemnation in Christ Jesus because there is another law, the law of the Spirit of life
Although you may rebuke an apple tree for not bringing forth bananas, it will not cause the apple tree to bring forth bananas
No farmer would be so foolish as to try to teach a plant to bring forth something, yet many Christians are foolish in this way
With these points in mind, we can come to chapter eight, and we can know what is the law of the Spirit of life
The God who is the law of the Spirit of life is not merely the God in Genesis 1, nor merely the God in Matthew 1
In Genesis 1 the Spirit was the Spirit of the Creator, but in Romans 8 the Spirit is the Spirit of the Resurrector
He is now rather the very God processed through incarnation, through crucifixion, through resurrection, and now into ascension
Finally, it also says that the Spirit who is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ and Christ Himself now indwells you
Such a God a processed God a processed Triune God being God Himself being the Spirit being Christ being the One indwelling you is the law
It doesn't mean that the law is one thing and that the Spirit is another thing and that the life is still another thing
He has within Him the human nature and crucifixion and resurrection and ascension and the defeat of Satan and the condemnation of sin!
Even up to this day there is little Body life because the secret of how to have the Body life has not been unveiled
We also must see how this law works scientifically through all the ingredients which are incorporated in this wonderful Being
As long as this wonderful Being exists in us, He Himself as a law works through all that He has and all that He is
It is used in the same way in chapter seven where Paul indicates that there is a law in his flesh that always tends to sin that works to sin
The term, 'the law of the Spirit of life,' is only mentioned once, but then in the definition it is not mentioned
The first verse mentions God's creating, and then the rest of the chapter is a definition, an explanation, a description of God's creation
The Triune God is this law, and this Triune God is the One who has been processed and who is now indwelling us
Even in Genesis 1 the pronoun used for God is not only in singular number, but also in plural number-our image
Even before the creation began there was a kind of counsel or consideration between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Today God is no longer working in the way of activity because He has installed Himself into us as the life and as the power
In his Epistles, Paul tells us clearly that since the time we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him, He has come into us
Whatever this processed and installed and indwelling God does in us, with us, and on us is the function of the law
The best medical doctor is one who is the best scientific student of all the principles and laws of the human body
After we were saved-forgiven by God of our sins and washed by His blood-we began to try our best to please God
Some might argue that the phrase 'in Christ Jesus' is not an adjective phrase modifying law but an adverbial phrase modifying freed
Some Christians in the past may have touched the law of the Spirit of life in a proper way, causing it to work
Sometimes certain 'pious' Christians like James in the New Testament may say that we should not be hearers only but also doers
We all have experienced this kind of thing, but the problem is that we do not remain in this kind of touch with the Lord
The genuine help, the real help, is just to get the saints into the touch with the Lord that will let the automatic law work
As the law of the Spirit of life works in such a one, it will reduce his problem and solve his problem and kill some of his germs
Sometimes a medical doctor may not give you the genuine healing, but just a kind of temporary soothing and comfort
The real help is to get into this touch with the Lord that will cause the automatic law of the Spirit of life to operate within us
Even though we may not know so many of the things within us, when this law works within us, it reduces and eliminates
Through the years many so-called spiritual giants have encouraged people to contact the Lord, to fellowship with the Lord, to pray
They only enjoyed the result to some extent, so they encouraged people to practice certain things and to enjoy certain things
Something in you will spontaneously work in a scientific way to solve this problem for you and to deal with that thing for you
In actuality, in biblical doctrine, very few points are so high, so deep, so difficult to explain, so difficult to get
You have to remember that while Romans 8 is on the law of the Spirit of life, its major work is to free us from another law
The law of the Spirit of life is nothing less than the Triune God processed to be the indwelling Spirit within us
Paul uses many terms: God, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Jesus, the One who raised up Christ Jesus from among the dead
As a husband the more you endeavor to love your wife praying that the Lord would help you to love her the more you may be disgusted with her
Many wives like to see their husbands coming to the so-called church to be edified, hoping that their husbands would love them more
The husbands like to see their wives going to the so-called church so that they will be edified and not trouble them so much
He is the Creator, the One who was incarnated, the Redeemer, the Savior, the processed One, and consummately He is the Spirit indwelling us
They say these are three separate and distinct Persons, that you cannot say that the Father is the Spirit, and the Son is the Spirit
We have seen that the first law, the law of the Spirit of life, is God triune, processed, becoming the indwelling Spirit
Concerning how the Triune God could become the law of the Spirit of life, the Bible is more than clear, especially in Romans 8
Hundreds of years before the people of Israel built Jerusalem in the good land, Babel was built as an expression of Satan
How pitiful that many Christians today make God absolutely objective, and in the same way, they also make Satan objective
Even as gravity is a powerful law outside of you, so there is a powerful law within you, the law of sin and of death
In Romans 7 and 8 there is the hint that sin and the law of sin and death are interchangeable terms or synonyms
Sometimes, especially in chapter seven, it seems it should say the law of sin and of death, but it only says sin
Of course, Romans doesn't say this in a direct way, but according to the entire teaching of the Bible we may infer this
They pointed out that this phrase 'concerning sin' does not go with the last clause, but with the first clause, 'God condemned'
He placed a parenthesis around the problem clause: 'which was impossible to the Law, because by the flesh it had no power'
Verses 9 through 11 speak of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ, and the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead
It also indicates the mingling of the indwelling Spirit who is the Triune God, and who after being processed, is with our spirit
The parallel verse in Galatians 4:6 says, 'God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
Many Christians, on the other hand, believe in a God who is triune with three separate persons-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Some, because of their ignorance and blindness and darkness, have considered that this kind of teaching is heretical
A well-known painting shows an old father sitting, a young son standing, and the spirit soaring in the air as a dove
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, according to the revelation of the Scriptures, are not separate as three Gods, but one unique God
He is now indwelling us in our spirit, and Romans 8 also indicates He will spread into our mind, and eventually He will saturate our body
When we coordinate or cooperate with the indwelling Spirit to put to death the practices of our body our body also is life
The very God who is triune and who has been processed and who has become the indwelling Spirit is firstly installed into our spirit
It might be that the general manager would hear our pitiful prayer and send some power and heat and light to us
Sometimes in our earnest and yet foolish prayer, we accidently pushed the right button and for several days we were such a nice husband
Many saints discovered through the Scriptures that praying is the secret, but they didn't have such a clear light as we have seen today
If you drop a book, and it falls to the earth, you shouldn't condemn Satan, saying that he took away your book
The law in our members is always warring against this good law in our mind and making us captive to the law of sin which is in our members
Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned'
At that time Satan entered into man and that entered Satan is nothing less than Satan himself becoming a system in us
From that time onward, when man wanted to steal, to commit fornication, to kill people, he didn't need to do it by activity but by law
Now there is a fourth law, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus which can deliver us and free us from the law of sin and of death
In a recent conference we had three messages telling us how that God is the positive law within us, and Satan is the negative law within us
In that conference we also pointed out that these two laws are very much related to the two trees in Genesis 2
Since God, the processed God, has been installed into our being, He works within us not by any activity but by law
Through all the centuries few Christians have seen that God is working in His chosen and redeemed people not by activity but by law
To kneel down and pray, calling on the power plant or calling upon the mighty God in the heavens, does not work
By this illustration you can understand that since God has been installed into us, He works in us not by activity but by law
When you have finished Romans 4, you have graduated from high school and are at the threshold of college in Romans 5
After such a desperate cry the answer came: 'There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus'
Unless you are desperate, even this Perfecting Training from tonight and onward will not be a real help to you
After you have a clear view about the installed electricity in this building, spontaneously you know how to enjoy the installed electricity
To say, 'There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,' is not an instruction; this is a description
Verse 6 goes on to say, 'For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace'
In Romans 8 is a clear view of the processed God who, after being installed into us, becomes the law of the Spirit of life
The 'electricity' has been installed, so there is no need to kneel down and pray to the 'power plant' to do something for us
Because we have two such marvelous intercessors within us, we surely don't need to pray so much in that old way
To cooperate with this law is to walk according to spirit and to walk according to spirit is the way to cooperate with this working law
Verse 4 speaks of walking according to flesh, but in verse 5 the word 'walk' is changed to the word 'are'-those who are according to spirit
Later, when we start to do something we are reminded that we should do everything according to spirit, and then we come back to the spirit
We may do this thing according to spirit, and we may do that thing according to spirit, but we ourselves are not according to spirit
When we are according to spirit, the law, that is, God Himself, works within us spontaneously, freeing us from sin and death
In the last message we saw that the proper walk according to spirit must be that we ourselves are according to spirit
According to the traditional Christian concepts, when we pray to God for certain things, then God comes in to do something as an activity
In the Old Testament sometimes He came in to do something for His people, and many times He answered His people's prayers
In the New Testament economy, God works for His redeemed people not by activities but by the automatic principle
Not only in our daily life but even in the ministry of the Word all the brothers must learn not to ask the Lord to do something by activity
Some Christians, especially those who have been ministering the Word, may have prayed for inspiration, for revelation, and for light
Many times while we were speaking, we were not expecting light and revelation, but light and revelation rose up from within us
If you only know the Lord by His activities and not by His law, you are just ignorant of the New Testament economy
If you are not a person according to spirit and you go shopping, it will be difficult for you to shop according to spirit
The issue is that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh but according to spirit
Verse 5 begins with 'for,' indicating that verse 5 is the definition of what it is to walk according to spirit
For those who are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to spirit, the things of the Spirit'
Remember that in chapter seven, which may be considered as the background for chapter eight, there is no spirit
Among today's Christians, there is also so much ignorance and blindness and darkness concerning the matter of the human spirit
They are short of vocabulary, they are short of knowledge, and they are altogether in the traditional ignorance
You need to pick up all these phrases, expressions, terms, utterances, and new words to learn the spiritual things
Your spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit, and now your mind is attached to your spirit; it is not detached
Don't even take the way of many Christians to make up your mind to be victorious or to be nice or to love your wife
It is not the meeting nor the ministry that helps you, but the very law of the Spirit of life working in you automatically by its principle
Verse 7 reads, 'Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be'
In Ephesians 4, it speaks of the spirit of the mind for renewing, and in Romans 8 it speaks of the mind of the spirit for interceding
When you set your mind on the spirit, making your mind one with the spirit, it is at that time that you are really in the spirit
In the same principle, the way to be in the spirit is to set your mind on the spirit, making your mind one with the spirit
If you consider the illustration of playing a piano or typing on a typewriter, you will realize this is altogether possible
When your mind is set on the spirit, making your mind one with the spirit, then the spirit becomes the spirit of your mind
In Ephesians 4:23 the spirit becomes the spirit of the mind, and in Romans 8 the mind of the Spirit is for interceding
It is difficult to say, because now the Spirit is mingled with your spirit, and the Spirit here is interceding within you
In the same principle, it is the Spirit's mind, but now the Spirit's mind is one with our mind, because our mind is set on the spirit
The Spirit's mind is one with our mind, and this mingled heart, this mingled mind, becomes a part of our spirit
Lord, do give us another revelation that we may have another clear view concerning Your economy of Your salvation
We look unto You that You would infuse us with Your thought with Your feeling with Your uptodate revelation and with Your fresh utterances
These verses read as follows: 'For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace
Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be
The enmity against God, the lack of subjection to the law of God, and the lack of possibility to be subject are actually things of the mind
If the mind is set on the spirit, there is a positive result; if the mind is set on the flesh, there is a negative result
You have to be assured, and you have to thank the Lord, that you do have something within you that has no problem
In 2 Timothy 1:7 Paul said, 'God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind'
If you would pray before doing something, you would discover whether or not that something is from your mind or from your spirit
If you pray and contact the Lord before doing something, and your feeling is still to do that something, it may be of the spirit
If something is simply from your mind, after you pray and contact the Lord, you will sense right away that you shouldn't do it
Although we may say doctrinally that we need to turn to the spirit, according to experience it is a little different
When you feel that you are weak you have to condemn that and tell Satan that God has never given you such a spirit
When they talk about regeneration, they always consider that to be something of the 'Holy Ghost' who is far, far from them
After a while your husband or your wife may cause you to react and to stir up your mind to go down to the flesh
By reading these two chapters carefully, you could see that chapter eight is a real continuation of chapter seven
In 8:5 it seems there is the matter of going to the spirit, and in verse 6 it seems there is the matter of staying with the spirit
All the following verses give us many items to keep the mind set upon the spirit and to make the mind stand with the spirit
Whenever you mean business in calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, right away your mind is turned to the spirit
At other times you may fellowship with the saints or sing to the Lord and find that something in your being is turned to the spirit
When your mind goes down to the flesh and remains there, you are 'those' who are in the flesh and you cannot please God
In verse 9, you would not, of course, say that the Spirit of God dwells of you, but you might say that the Spirit of God dwells with you
When you say that you were born of the Spirit, it means that the Spirit is the very source of your regeneration
If, in your spiritual condition, you are still only of the Spirit and not in the Spirit, this indicates a shortage
You were born of the Spirit, and the Spirit is your source and position, yet your condition is not in the Spirit
A person may be of the Spirit and yet live in the flesh, but a person who is merely born of the flesh could never live in the Spirit
On the one hand, we really are of the Spirit, but on the other hand, sometimes we are not that much in the spirit
Concerning us, Paul used a form of the verb 'to be,' but concerning the Spirit he used a strong and proper verb, 'dwell'
Far we have been speaking according to the words according to grammar according to position to possession to occupation and to condition
The point is this, dear saints: the Spirit really dwells in us, regardless of whether your weather is cold or hot or stormy or calm
Grant us the light, the enlightenment, even the revelation with Your vision, that we may see the secrets of the way of life
The same root word is found in Ephesians 3:17 where it says that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith
Now we need to pay our attention to something further, that is, the change of the expression concerning the Spirit in verse 9
Some may have thought that these are two Spirits-that the Spirit of God is one Spirit and that the Spirit of Christ is another Spirit
Not only so, in verse 2, there is another interchangeable term concerning the Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life
Now in Romans 8 this Spirit of God is no more merely the Spirit of God, but He is also now the Spirit of Christ
Verse 10 reads: 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
According to my experience and knowledge, perhaps no other verse in the whole Bible is so profound and so deep as verse 10
It could also be translated 'and furthermore' which would indicate strongly that verse 10 is a further addition to verse 9
Verse 10 goes on to say, 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
It seems it should read either that the body is death and the spirit is life or that the body is dead and the spirit is living
It does not say that the body was dead, in the past tense, nor does it say that the body will be dead, in the future tense
In Vincent's Word Studies in the New Testament, he strongly stresses in his notes on 2 Corinthians 3:17 that Christ is the Spirit
On the one hand, for the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Christ to dwell in us is an experience, but on the other hand, it is a fact
Although it is the Spirit who dwells in you, when you come to worship or to pray you would rarely say, 'O Spirit'
For us to experience Him, He is the Spirit; for us to worship Him, to call on Him, to mention Him, His title is Christ
Later on we have to see something further of the difference between these two titles: the Spirit of Christ and Christ
When, according to our dead body, we would sometimes forget about the meeting, something rises up within us to go to the meeting
If Satan were outside of us, he would have little to do with us, but we all know that since man's fall Satan entered into man
The Triune God is righteousness in our spirit, and the enemy of God, Satan, is in our body, making our body dead
How we thank You for all the churches with so many seeking saints coming together often to be Your oracle for Your speaking
It reads, 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
We see the word that says we should honor the parents, and love the neighbors, and submit to the husbands, and so forth
Even though we didn't have such a knowledge, right after we were saved, we began to discover that within us there was a conflict
You desired to do this and to do that for the glory of God, but something within you would not allow you to do it
Before you were saved, your sensation probably was that you were good and you could do whatever you wanted to do
Although sometimes you might still boast outwardly, yet within you felt you didn't have the assurance concerning your boasting
The tragedy is that we were born spiritually of some who never educated us concerning these things, so we didn't know what was happening
Even while they were involved in something sinful they would testify that deep within them they still loved the Lord Jesus
After you were saved and when you slid back into your sin you experienced two things: your body is dead, and your spirit is life
All these experiences are related to the one discovery that when Christ is in you, your body is dead, and your spirit is life
We Christians all have Christ in us, but sometimes according to our feeling and according to our defeated experience, Christ is not in us
One verse in the New Testament, 2 Corinthians 5:21, covers sin and righteousness clearly, definitely, correctly, and accurately
It says, 'Him Who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him'
According to your Christian discovery havent you realized that in your body there is nothing good that in your flesh there is nothing good
Something vital and something vigorous is in your being, and that is your spirit being life through righteousness
We have to realize that in our flesh, in our body, there is nothing but just the totality of rebellion against God
Not only when your body does bad things, but even when your body does good things, it is still in rebellion against God
What is in your spirit is always right with God; even that is God Himself, because God Himself is in your spirit
As long as you have God, as long as you live God, and as long as you go along with God, you are right with God
The real things of man are not the daily necessities such as a wife or a husband or children or parents or a house or a car
Although many Christians do have the Bible, many of them do not know the things of man because they do not exercise their spirit
They consider that the human spirit is the human soul, that the human soul is the human heart, that the human heart is the human mind
Verse 3 reads: 'For I, being absent in the body, but present in the spirit, have already judged as being present him who so did this'
From these verses you can see that the wonderful book of 1 Corinthians is a book very much on the spirit of man
Do you realize there is a big history related to the human flesh and a big history related to the human spirit?
You have to realize that that tree denotes Satan because God warned Adam that if he ate of that tree he would die
On the one hand, Satan is opposing and attacking God, and on the other hand, sin is ruining and corrupting man
It was influenced by man's fall so that it became deadened and lost its function, but it was not invaded by God's enemy
That is the real life of man, and according to God's creation in Genesis 2:7, man's spirit came from the breath of God
We know this from Proverbs 20:27 which reads, 'The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all his innermost parts'
If a fallen person would take care of his conscience, he would never rob a bank; he would not steal; he would not go to sinful places
Rather, you considered other matters such as knowing the Bible, improving yourself, or going to the mission field
If you know these matters in an adequate way, not only are they a kind of revelation, but they are also a kind of salvation
In the last message we pointed out that in Romans 8:10 you could see two histories: the history of the flesh and the history of our spirit
Of course, the word 'flesh' is not used in Romans 8:10; rather, it speaks of the body being dead because of sin
For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh'
Whenever you would consider these two as synonyms referring to the same thing, you must add a word: death or dead or mortal
When Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that fruit entered into the members of his body
When it enters into the members of our body, it enters into our body, because our body is composed with the members
You have to realize that if our body had never been ruined and corrupted, our body would not be mortal and our body could never be dead
Why then in Romans 8:3-9 does Paul use the word flesh, but when he comes to verse 10, change the expression from flesh to the body?
In that chapter there is a contrast between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit, meaning the Holy Spirit
According to these points, you can see that the King James Version of the Bible is wrong in its translation of Romans 8:10
Of course, according to the letters it is hard to decide whether the Spirit should be our spirit or the Spirit of God
Even as the phrase, 'the body is dead' implies a history, so the phrase, 'the spirit is life' also implies a history
We have pointed out in the past that this Christ who is within us in our spirit is not only life to us, but He has to be our person
Many unbelievers realize that in their flesh there is a person, but none of them would admit that that person is Satan
The New Testament saints, such as John and Peter and Paul, were even higher than John the Baptist because they came later than he
In the same principle, we would have to say that we are better and higher than John and Peter and Paul because we have come later
Many Christian teachers today do not teach according to the principles of the Bible; they just teach ethical principles
They teach people to improve themselves and to behave themselves and to conduct themselves in the best way to glorify God
Sisters, do you behave yourself and conduct yourself in a very nice way, or do you live by Christ in your spirit?
The Christian's life is one that escapes the first person-Satan in his flesh-and lives the second person-Christ in his spirit
Verse 6 says that you have to set your mind on the spirit, and verse 9 says you have to be a person in the spirit
The Christian life is to walk according to the spirit, to mind the spirit, to have your mind set on the spirit, and to be in the spirit
Although Confucius was a top ethical person, he was wrong because he keeps people away from the kingdom of Christ
For nearly three thousand years, the Chinese people and others in the Far East have been kept from being like wild beasts
God exercised His divine sovereignty and authority to use the law, government, ethics, and culture to preserve humanity
We have to say again: the Bible revelation doesn't stress ethics; it emphasizes Christ as our life in our spirit
Some Christians today just stress the teachings, and others just stress the outward experiences of the 'Holy Ghost'
Lord, do grant us Your presence, Your anointing, Your self, that we might touch You once more and be touched by You
The pronoun you in these verses signifies the soul, especially referring to your will and to your mind and to your emotion
The problem with most of us concerning the spiritual life is this: either we are at the north pole, or we are at the south pole
To say that you need to have your mind, will, and emotion exercised is equal to being saved and to being empowered
If you don't have any appetite, regardless of how many times you would attend the meetings, you will get little help
According to doctrine it may seem these are two different things, but according to experience these are one thing
The Spirit, the One who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead, that is, the Father, and Christ Jesus Himself are all three mentioned
You also have to realize that in the study, in the research, in your laboratory, it does have to be recorded in this way
To say that the Father who raised Jesus Christ from among the dead gives life to our body through the Spirit is a record of the research
He also must be one who knows the things concerning the Triune God and the things concerning the tripartite man
We know this doctrinally, but we have not paid adequate attention to the fact that there is such a One residing in us
We have to say that not only does Christ live in us, but He is also being formed in us, and He is making His home in us
Surely in verse 11 when Paul uses the phrase 'the Spirit of the One Who raised Jesus from among the dead,' it does not indicate a ghost
If there had not been such a human living of thirty-three and a half years, how could you have a complete Jesus?
He was incarnated, and He lived on this earth, not for three and a half hours, but for thirty-three and a half years
Many believers still consider that the Holy Father is in the heavens and the Son is there with Him and His Holy Spirit is now working in us
Paul's repetition in verse 11 is to impress us that while the Spirit is residing in us, the Triune God is within us
While the putting to death of the practices of the body is going on within you, the life giving would be there
You may have a doctrine concerning the life-giving Spirit, but you don't have much of the actuality of the life giving itself
You have to realize that walking is not the first point of the experience, although it is mentioned here first
Verse 4 says That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh but according to spirit
Which of these two matters, the walking according to spirit or the setting of the mind on the spirit, comes first?
Probably the setting of the mind on the spirit comes first firstly the mind is set upon the spirit and then you walk according to the spirit
While the Spirit is residing in you, the One who raised Jesus from among the dead gives life to your dying body
He not only gives life to our spirit and to our mind, the leading part of our soul, but He also gives life to our mortal body
He does not give life directly; He gives life through the indwelling Spirit, through the Spirit who resides in you
Although the putting to death is your experience, you do it through the same agent, through the Spirit or by the Spirit
You set your mind on the spirit, you walk according to spirit, and you put to death the practices of your body by the Spirit
There is the experience of the residing Spirit and the experience of the One who raised up Jesus from among the dead
Whatever is mentioned in verse 14 is a continuation and reason and explanation of what has been mentioned before
The leading of the Spirit is very crucial because it may be considered as the totality of the experiences mentioned in verses 10 through 13
The leading of the Spirit is the totality of the experience of the residing plus the life giving plus the putting to death
In chapter eight there is no thought about tongue-speaking or miracle-working; there is no thought about doing a work
According to the New Testament, especially Romans 8 and 2 Corinthians 4, the putting to death is not something which is once for all
Of talking so much, you need to pick up the habit of praising more, putting to death the practice of your body
The matter of the leading in Romans 8 is so crucial because it is composed of the Spirits residing Gods life giving and our putting to death
If you have the residing of the Spirit in you plus God's giving life plus your putting to death, you will be clear in everything
Of course, some do not even believe in the co-inherence of the Three of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
If you have believed in Him and called upon His name, your sins have been forgiven and your spirit has been regenerated
Even the matter of giving life to your mortal body is an issue of the giving life into our spirit and the giving life into our mind
A person who has been regenerated and who has the residing Spirit within him giving life should not live any longer in a natural way
When you have the residing of the Spirit, the life giving of God, and your putting to death, you will have the leading of the Spirit
Our way of realizing the matter of the leading makes it so shallow, so general, and not so meaningful to our Christian life
As such a verse which concludes the first thirteen verses of chapter eight includes the matter of leading, it must be crucial
Although we may not understand those thirteen verses adequately, yet we cannot deny that there are too many crucial points revealed there
After all these crucial and important things are revealed, there is a conclusion that uses the thought of leading
Many Christians say they have the leading of the Lord to move here or to go there or to marry a certain person
Some Christians would consider that the circumstances or the happenings in our life are always confirmations to God's leading
If you consider the previous verses, you can realize that walking according to the spirit is very close to the matter of leading
The divine residing and the life giving by God and your putting to death the practices of the mortal body become the lead
The lead for you to make any kind of decision should not be based upon circumstances or some kind of reasoning
You must experience the residing of the Triune God, and you must experience the life giving of this processed Triune God
You don't need to depend upon the outward circumstances to confirm whether or not you are under the leading of the Lord
In experience these two things happen simultaneously with God's residing, with God's life giving, and with your putting to death
If someone is teasing a dog, and the dog is running, you may think that the teasing of that person is the lead
Verse 14 indicates that the matter of leading is here just because we are sons of God living a life under such a lead
Perhaps even for the whole day you spontaneously lived a life which proves and testifies to the fact that you are a son of God
Even to read a message such as this eventually brings you, if not in full, at least to some extent under this leading
You stay there to enjoy His burden in you to pray for certain things-for His Body, for His interest, for the church
Although we were not taught properly concerning the matter of leading, we do have a lot of concepts concerning the matter of leading
We are always concerned about what courses we should take in school, about how much money we should spend, or about the matter of marriage
Although vitamins had not been discovered many years ago, people had the experience of living by eating the vitamins
Basically the leading of the Spirit of God is composed of three elements, all from verse 2: the law, the Spirit, and life
These three elements-the law, the Spirit, and the life-are the very constituents that constitute the leading of the Spirit
In previous messages concerning the law, we have pointed out that the law is a Person, that is, the Triune God
There is the definition of the law, the definition of the life, the definition of the Spirit, and then verse 14 as a conclusion
Substantially speaking, essentially speaking, the leading is composed with these three elements: the law, the Spirit, and the life
We have seen that the constituents of the composition of the leading of the Spirit are three: the law, the Spirit, and the life
All of us have experienced that when we were intending to do certain things, there was a strong automatic forbidding within us
On the one hand we like to have a spouse, but on the other hand we don't like to have someone with us all the time
We are different from the dogs and cats and even the unbelievers, because we have another Person, Christ the Spirit, living in us
He is really bothering because our intention, our preference, our desire, our aspiration is always absolutely different from His
Between your desire, your intention, your preference, and your choice there is such a thing that is termed the leading of the Spirit
The struggle of your Christian life is just your preference struggling with this matter of the leading of the Spirit
Don't forget that the leading of the Spirit is a composition with three things: a life with a law and a Person
Most of the time you have been so strong that even such a composition could not put you down or convince you or overcome you
We were not instructed or taught concerning such a leading within us, so we have not had the knowledge concerning the leading of the Spirit
Even to have a strong person stay in your home is something, to say nothing of a strong Person who is indwelling your inner part
We have a strong One who is quite active and living and working and speaking and all the time repeating His word within us
Verse 3 speaks of God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemning sin in the flesh
Verse 4 says that the righteous requirement of the law could be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh but according to spirit
Verse 7 says that the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be
Verses 9 through 11 say that 'you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
When we talk about the leading of the Spirit, or the leading by the Spirit of God, we spontaneously understand it in a habitual way
If you look at today's Christianity, you can see that a lot of things have been picked up since the Apostle Paul was on this earth
If you are willing all the time to put to death the practices of your mortal body, not only is the leading in you, but also you are led
The genuine leading is nothing less or nothing more than the divine life plus its function, the law, and the divine Person, the Spirit
As long as you put to death all the practices, all the deeds, all the doings, of your mortal body, you are led
Your reading of the Bible, your prayer, and your waiting are all the different steps of your making up a kind of leading
We may have lived a life that was much regulated and that was much improved but it was not so much a life that designated us the sons of God
By reading John 11 you can find very few of the apostles' or the disciples' doings that were under the Lord's leading
Today the Lord is much closer to us than He was to the disciples in the four Gospels before His death and resurrection
It is so strange that the Lord did not answer Martha and Mary's prayer, and the Lord did not tell Peter and John and James what to do
His stay in us today is very close and very subjective; it is very dear, very precious, very real, and very practical
Many of us could testify that the more we prayed in this way, the more we were distracted, the more we didn't know what was the leading
It also describes the genuine leading which is the processed Triune God to be the all-inclusive indwelling life-giving Spirit
In this message we consider once more Romans 8:14 which reads: 'For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God'
If we would know the leading of the Spirit, we must get through the point which we are going to cover in this message
The problem is this: most Christians through the centuries have considered that God's leading is just God's action, God's activity
Sometimes Christians say that they have a leading from the Lord, but eventually they discover that they went the wrong way
Some have been taught to seek the leading of God according to three things the inner feeling the Word of God and the outward circumstances
To know this is one thing, and to realize daily, hourly, and even momentarily that you have another One living within you is another thing
The Triune God is now living in us, not to be our roommate, but to be our life, our nature, our everything, even eventually to replace us
Suppose you are such a person: you have this One living within you to be your life, to be your nature, to be your everything, to replace you
When you look at Him, the law of His life right away works within you and becomes a kind of automatic strength
By experience we could realize that being led by the Spirit is the initial step and, strictly speaking, this is in our spirit
As long as you walk according to spirit, that really means you put every bit of your natural activity to death
These three steps include God's residing in you, His supplying you with life, and your putting to death of your natural activities
Before doing anything, before saying anything, before going any place, even before thinking anything, you must look at Him
In the concluding verse, verse 14, the crucial point is leading, and in the opening verse the crucial point is condemnation
Romans 5:10 tells us that through His death we have been reconciled to God, but after that, we are being saved in His life
These three words may be considered as the first three letters of the alphabet used to compose the word leading
He speaks in a more complicated way, a more significant way: 'the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead'
If you mean business to know and to realize what is the leading of the Spirit, you must get into these twenty-two items
If you will get into these negative items and even pray-read these negative items, you will see who you were and perhaps still are
Of these eleven negative letters, two tell us who we were and perhaps who we still are: dead persons and debtors
As long as you are even a little bit involved with these nine items of your natural situation, you are not under the leading by the Spirit
They have thought that they have the leading of God yet they are still under sin under the sinful law even under a kind of spiritual death
Regardless of how much you think or feel that you are under the leading of God, you are actually outside of it
You are actually far beyond the leading of God, because the leading of the Spirit is altogether something far beyond these eleven items
You say that you have the Lord's leading to do this or to do that, but when you do that are you a debtor, or are you a released person?
To be a son of God means that we are full of life, that we are in maturity, that we are full of liberty, with no bondage, no debt
After these comes the Triune God: the Father as the Spirit, Christ the Son as the Spirit, and the Triune God as the resurrecting One
If you could really get through all these check points, you can be assured that you have the leading by the Spirit
We all came from that region where the understanding of the matter of the leading of the Spirit was mostly natural
It is wrong in this aspect: you consider that the leading by the Spirit is a matter for activities, for actions, or for business
In Romans 8 there is no hint that the leading by the Spirit is related to activities or works or actions or business
You didn't live that way, but when the occasion came up and you needed to do something or to face a situation, you sought the Lord's leading
Some might argue that certain instances in Acts indicate that the early Apostles received the Lord's leading for activities
That was the Lord's leading, but you have to realize that all the day long Philip was under the Spirit's leading
Rather, Peter all the day long was living and walking in the spirit, and he simply went to the housetop to pray
In Acts 16 is an example of another person who was altogether living and even dreaming under the leading by the Spirit
We must have some kind of arrangement and plan for our education, for our children, for our job, and for our business
The New Testament teaches us that whether we have a job or a business, or whether we receive the highest education or not, we live by faith
It doesn't mean that since you have the best education, you would have a successful business and you would have the best future
Who could have told us that in 1973 there would be an oil embargo which would affect the entire world economy?
Today the matter of making a living is a big distraction that carries the Lord's children away from His leading
You would never choose a job which would give you better pay and yet take so much time away from your seeking after the Lord
Thank You for such a time that we could be here in peace, enjoying the safety to seek after You and to get into Your leading
Our spirit is quite wonderful because the processed Triune God indwells our spirit and mingles with our spirit
By reading verses 9 and 10 carefully, we can see that there is an implication that the Spirit of Christ is versus the dead
If you are not a person living under the leading by the Spirit of life, it would be hard for you to decide where God wants you to study
If you are right with such a living under the leading by the Spirit, whatever you say is under the leading by the Spirit
Whatever you do is under the leading by the Spirit because your entire living is under the leading by the Spirit
As long as we walk this way, and we live such a life under the leading by the Spirit, whatever we do will be also under the leading
You may consider that many people sin in business, but you have to realize that they sin in business because they are sinful in their living
The Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of the One comprising all of the Three of the Trinity are also matters of living
Even those who claim to have no thought about religion, the atheists, cannot stay away absolutely from the influence of religion
As long as you are a human being, born as a descendant of Adam and living on this earth, you are under the influence of religion
Although we have given more than twenty-five messages on Romans 8, it may be that you still consider Romans 8 as something religious
It might be that you talk one way at home, but then talk another way in order to prepare yourself for the meeting
When you read the newspaper you may live in one way, and when you read a Life-study message you may live in another way
As long as you make a spiritual thing only a section of your daily living and not your whole daily living, that is a performance
One way is the way of living with his wife, and the other way is the way of living with the brothers in the church
Whether we are American, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Indonesian, French, or English, we are genuine descendants of Adam
When you come to Romans 8, after the first thirteen verses, it says, 'As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God'
After this you come to the Spirit in three aspects: the Spirit of God , the Spirit of Christ , and the Spirit of the resurrecting One
These are not three Spirits but one Spirit with three aspects the Spirit of God the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of the resurrecting One
We don't need teachings or exhortations, but we need to see all these constituents of our genuine and proper living as sons of God
A law who is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is working, operating, moving, and anointing within us!
We will not have different kinds of living in our home, in our school, in our office, in the church life, or in the meeting
In Romans 8 there are eleven positive items which may be considered as the components of the spiritual leading
The Spirit is used three times: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised up Jesus from among the dead
Is the Spirit of Christ, referring to Christ the Son, and thirdly is the Spirit of the One, referring to the Spirit of the Godhead
The spiritual life or the Christian life is just one filled with the Triune God, and it is one wrapped up with our human spirit
By beholding and reflecting with an unveiled face as a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are being transformed into the same image
If you say that we could be made like God in life and in nature, not as an object of people's worship, this is altogether right
To say that believers of Christ could not be like God is like saying someone who is born of a man could not be like a man
There is no need to ask someone what style of haircut you should have or what style of clothing you should wear
He is also involved with the Spirit in three aspects: with the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One
He is the Spirit in three aspects: He is the Spirit as the Father; He is the Spirit as the Son; He is the Spirit as the resurrecting One
We praise You that You have a people on this earth seeking after Your heart and coming together week after week
In such a dark age You still separate us unto Yourself, unto Your Word, unto Your purpose, and unto Your eternal economy
The third group is the group of the Triune God, including the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One
Some versions of the Bible render the spirit in Romans 8:4 with a small letter 's,' indicating that the spirit is our human spirit
Other versions, such as the King James Version, render the spirit with a capital 'S' indicating that it refers to the Holy Spirit
Not only is He within you, but He is also mingling Himself with your spirit to make your spirit and Him one spirit
You have to learn how to mind the things of God such as how God selected you before the foundation of the world
Sometimes you need even to pray in this way, worshipping, praising, and thanking God by enumerating all these items
If you would worship God for a period of time with this kind of praise, you would see how holy and spiritual and heavenly you would be
The things which you are praising for become your enjoyment and become a base, a ground, for you to set your entire soul on
Sometimes after brothers and sisters have bought a new car, their mind has really been set on the car for at least a month
Your spirit is mingled by and with the Spirit of God; then it is wrapped up with all these things of God concerning Christ
If someone fulfills the law of electricity, the electricity in the building works, not by activity nor by accident, but by law
You might argue that we have printed and published some messages saying that you need to call on the Lord's name as loudly as possible
To have your spirit mingled with Gods Spirit is a great matter but to have such a law working in your inner being is something even greater
