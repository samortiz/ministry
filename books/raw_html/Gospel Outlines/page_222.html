<h1 class="title">THE ASCENSION OF JESUS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 1:9-11; 2:33; 5:31</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Being resurrected, Jesus lives in this universe, in the heavens.</li>
<li>The witnesses of His ascension
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>His disciples saw His ascension.</li>
	<li>The angels also saw it and bore witness to it.</li>
	<li>His ascension happened in time and space.</li>
	<li>It was not a figment of man&rsquo;s imagination or an abstraction, but an accomplished historical fact.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The authority of His name proves Jesus&rsquo; ascension
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Bible says that when He ascended He received a name which is above every name.</li>
	<li>Whenever man calls on that name, the authority in it is manifested, and prayers are answered.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Today the whole world recognizes Jesus<br />
<span class="normal">This is also a proof of His ascension. The whole world uses His birth as the basis of its calendar. When a person&rsquo;s birthdate is recognized as the basis of a people&rsquo;s calendar, to the same person does that people belong. Thus the whole world unconsciously recognizes Him as the Lord of all.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Forty-one</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE COMING AGAIN OF JESUS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Matt. 16:27; Acts 1:11; 1 Thes. 4:16-17; 2 Thes. 1:7-10; Phil. 3:20-21</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Jesus Himself said that He will come again.</li>
<li>In His ascension the angels mentioned that He will come again.</li>
<li>All His disciples said that He will come again.</li>
<li>His coming is with signs
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Bible tells us that the greatest of the signs are the restoration of the nation of Israel and the increase of tribulations.</li>
	<li>Even the astronomers and the geologists tell us that the tribulations on the earth are increasing.</li>
	<li>Since the signs preceding His coming are being fulfilled, His coming will definitely come to pass.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>His coming is for two things
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He will rapture those that believe in Him.</li>
	<li>He will judge the unbelieving ones.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How will He regard you at His coming?<br />
<span class="normal"><em>Develop this point.</em></span></li>
