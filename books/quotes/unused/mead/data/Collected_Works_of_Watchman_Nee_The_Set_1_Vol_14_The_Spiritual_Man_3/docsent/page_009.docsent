   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is another matter that we should know about: the condition for evil spirits to work.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already spoken briefly about passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we must go on to investigate it one step further.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this world there are some people who are very interested in fellowship with evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No ordinary man would want to be possessed by demons, but these people are willing to be possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are the necromancers, planchettes, mediums, and typtologists ones who "bring down" spirits .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we consider carefully the reason for their being demon-possessed, we can understand the principle of all demon-possession because all demon-possessions follow the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These people tell us that in order to be possessed by a demon, which they call a god, their will must be completely void of resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that they must be willing to accept anything that comes to their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, in order for their will to be passive, their mind must be empty and completely functionless, for only emptiness of the mind produces passivity of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two things are the basic conditions for being possessed by the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why a typtologist has to shake his head and dishevel his hair, and continue doing this for a long time until he becomes completely numbed in his head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only then can he be possessed by a so-called god, and only then can the evil spirit operate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the head is this empty, the will naturally loses all its functions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When this state is reached, little by little, the mouth no longer moves according to the person's own will, and the whole body begins to shiver.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Soon after, the "god" comes to his body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With those who communicate with demons, the methods by which they become possessed may be different in outward respects.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, upon examining the principle, we can find that the methods are all done through the mind becoming empty and the will becoming passive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One thing is certain: if you ask these people, they will surely tell you that when demons come, their mind cannot think of course, if the will could become passive without the mind becoming empty, the mind would still think , and their will cannot function.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, they must attain to a state of emptiness in the mind and passivity in the will before the demons will come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, they will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The so-called modern-day hypnotism, which disguises itself under the name of science, and religious and transcendental meditation, etc., which enable people to possess the power of telepathy and hear things from different directions, as well as healing and transformation, are actually founded upon these two principles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although in name they are for the good of mankind, the methods of "concentration," "mental focus," "yoga," "meditation," etc., all require the mind to first become quiet and the will to become passive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Soon after, supernatural spirits will come and show these ones many wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For now, we will not ask if the ones who perform these things know that they are inviting evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All we know is that by doing these things, they are fulfilling the condition for evil spirits to possess them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As such, they cannot avoid the consequence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the end, they may wake up to the fact that they have received evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot cover these matters in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We merely want believers to understand that in order for evil spirits to work on man, it is necessary that man's mind and will be completely empty and passive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Evil spirits rejoice exceedingly at all who fulfill this condition and immediately go to work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a "heathen" fulfills this condition, evil spirits will possess him; when a believer fulfills this condition, evil spirits will also come into him without any reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to realize that many believers are ignorant of the conditions whereby evil spirits work and the fact that once a person fulfills these conditions, evil spirits will work in an unrestricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, many have unconsciously become mediums for demons and have even become possessed by demons!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Believers often try in the meetings to wait for the visitation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They gather until midnight and are filled with all sorts of soulish activities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their minds become numb, and their hearts are swayed beyond their control.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suddenly, they will begin to experience strange things, such as speaking in tongues, seeing visions, feeling joyful, etc. They feel that the Holy Spirit has indeed come.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we should realize that with such an emptiness of mind and passivity of will, the only ones that will work are evil spirits; the Holy Spirit will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will mention one obvious example: in meetings, their favorite prayer is to pray with one word, such as "glory," or "hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They chant repeatedly with their mouths single words.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we say the same word a few dozen times, we know what will happen: we will be muttering the same word in our mouth, but our mind will no longer know the meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the emptiness of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, one can no longer control himself; he must continue with this chanting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the passivity of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Finally, some external force will take over his throat and turn his jaws to utter things which are incomprehensible to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At this point, an ignorant believer will think that he has experienced the "baptism of the Holy Spirit" because he has received the evidence of baptism speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Little does he realize that he has merely fulfilled the condition for evil spirits to work; he has emptied his mind and allowed his will to become passive and has been taken over by demons!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today believers think that as long as what they have received makes them more "happy," "spiritual," "zealous," or "holy," it must all come from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They do not realize that this is the deception of evil spirits, who will resort to any means to gain the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once the evil spirits detect that the believers have displayed signs of the typtologists, they do not let the chance pass and immediately come into these believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They do not want to scare the believers away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, they do everything to gain the believers' trust.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They counterfeit the Lord Jesus, His loveliness, glory, and beauty, causing the believers to worship, love, and consecrate themselves to such a "Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What in fact happens is that the believers are worshipping, loving, and consecrating to evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When evil spirits have gained the full faith and trust of the believers, which can take variable lengths of time in many cases, many years , they will put into the believers things that are more obviously of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But by then, because of the believers' pride, laziness, and foolishness, most will not want to examine the kind of spirit they have received.</S>
