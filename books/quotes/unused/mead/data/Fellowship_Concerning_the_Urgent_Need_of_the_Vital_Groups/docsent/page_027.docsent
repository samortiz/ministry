   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING THE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE BLENDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we would practice the blending, we should not forget the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Fellowship is the basis for blending.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, we must practice the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By so doing we will lay the foundation for the blending.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, instead of practicing the fellowship, we have practiced hypocrisy for years; we have all been hiding ourselves under a mask.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without the foundation of intimate and thorough fellowship, there can be no blending.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not be afraid of being known by others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more we are known in a proper way, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will put down our pride, take away our boasting, annul our superiority complex, and even put aside our inferiority complex.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, most of us are not willing to expose ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, we prefer to cover ourselves by pretending to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of this, it is difficult for us to have an intimate and thorough fellowship that results in our being blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without the blending, the Lord has no way to go on with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Blending is the Body, blending is the oneness, and blending is the one accord it is all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we prefer to remain untouched and unknown by others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we do not like people to know us, we have become very sensitive, and our being sensitive causes us to be very touchy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a condition has forced us to be very cautious in our speaking, for fear of offending one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among us there is a great need for a breakthrough to allow the Lord to carry out the grouping.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From the very beginning in the four Gospels, when the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He did not send them one by one; rather, He always sent them two by two, grouping them together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the time the recovery came to the United States the Lord has not been able to carry out the grouping among us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A number of saints came into the recovery in a very strong way and remained with us, but at a certain point they left.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That indicated that they were not willing to be grouped together in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We who have remained in the recovery all have the problems of our disposition and character that keep us separate from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although by the Lord s mercy we are still together, among us there has been very little grouping.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this, we do not have the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The impact is with the one accord, and the one accord actually is the blending.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not have the one accord, God cannot answer our prayer, because we do not practice the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our not being in one accord means that we do not practice the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the proper interpretation of the New Testament, the one accord is the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must practice the principle of the Body; then we will have the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we may not fight with one another, we still may not have the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we have remained together, we have seen the Lord s blessing, but only in a limited way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we need to have the one accord to practice the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is difficult for us to open ourselves to one another, but it is even more difficult, after listening to one another s fellowship, to speak something in response in a way that is frank and full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After coming together in our groups, we should be free to tell the others concerning our inward situation with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, the others should be free to respond.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we are afraid to expose ourselves and are afraid of offending others, we pretend with one another and are unwilling to let people know our real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need the intimate and thorough fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, we need to be careful concerning what we open to one another in public.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In certain cases the public confession of sins has caused serious trouble in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not mean that we should open ourselves in a careless way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, we need to find a way to be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Otherwise, the Lord has no way out of our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to be blended until we have an intimate love for the members of our group.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we continue to hide ourselves and keep a distance from one another, when we go out to visit people, we will not have the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The people whom we visit will sense that we are not one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our situation today is very different from that of Peter, James, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When they were together following the Lord as His believers, they were genuine, as seen in the fact that they fought with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Matthew 20, while the Lord Jesus was unveiling His death and resurrection to them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>17-19 , it seems that they did not hear what He was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the Lord Jesus finished His speaking, they had a contention among themselves vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>20-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This indicates that they were very genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not practice the points in this message, there will be no way for us to be grouped.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Grouping is an urgent need among us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are trying to break through in this vital matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need to pray much concerning the building up of the vital groups.</S>
