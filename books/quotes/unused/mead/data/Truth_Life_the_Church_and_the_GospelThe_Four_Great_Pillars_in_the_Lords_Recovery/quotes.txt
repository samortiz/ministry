[1]  Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel - the Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery CONTENTS
[2]  The Lord has raised up His recovery upon the truth.
[3]  Over the past years, the Lord in His recovery has completed the life-study of the entire New Testament and the life-studies of Genesis and Exodus in the Old Testament.
[4]  Second, the manna could not be kept until the next day v. 19 . Some people were greedy and gathered large piles of manna which they were unable to finish eating, and the next day the manna bred worms and stank v. 20 . According to our experience, the matter of gathering the manna indicates first of all that we must spend time every morning to read the Lord s Word and to draw near to Him; otherwise, we will not be able to obtain each day s supply of life.
[5]  Some criticize us, saying that we read the life-study messages and not the Bible.
[6]  Some people have said that in the life-study messages there are many new, deep terms that are hard for ordinary saints to understand.
[7]  This is why those missionaries gradually improved their speaking and spoke about some basic truths in the Bible, telling people that there is one God who is the holy and righteous One and that this One sent His only begotten Son to shed His blood and die for us to redeem us from our sins and to save us from eternal perdition into eternal life.
[8]  From now on, regardless of whether we are preaching the gospel or speaking God s word, we should not be afraid that people will not understand when we speak the profound truths.
[9]  Thus, if we learn the techniques, when we preach the gospel to people, we will be able to appropriately use the highest truths in the Lord s recovery and say, Friend, we are all sinners without God inside of us.
[10]  Even more than this, after we are regenerated, if we are willing to deal with our sins and apply the Lord s blood for a thorough washing, then God s economical Spirit will be poured out upon us, making us full of power.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE CHURCH AS THE GARDEN OF GOD THE CHURCH BEING A GARDEN
[12]  As Paul said, our work in the church is that of planting and watering while God alone causes the growth 1 Cor 3:6-7 .
[13]  The purpose of going over this history is so that we would realize that the turmoil in the church in Manila in 1961 did not begin in 1961.
[14]  Hence, we see in perspective that the Lord has given the entire Philippines to His recovery because the Lord s pure gospel and His complete truth are in His recovery.
[15]  Nevertheless, most Filipinos know only a little about God and have heard only a fraction of the gospel, which in most cases was not the pure gospel.
[16]  The people here know about the existence of God and also fear God, but there is not much preaching of the pure gospel and even less speaking of the complete truth.
[17]  What delights us beyond all else in the church is seeing so many young people being raised up.
[18]  When we see the older people, we also cannot help but smile, because they are the fathers, the base of the church.
[19]  In the past sixty years the Lord has been opening up the Bible to us day by day, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse.
[20]  We may say that until now there has not been another group of Christians who has spoken on Genesis chapter two and especially on the tree of life as clearly as they have been spoken in the Lord s recovery.
[21]  In the same way, today there is no one outside of the Lord s recovery who can speak on the truth in the last two chapters of Revelation regarding the New Jerusalem to the degree of clarity that we have seen and spoken it.
[22]  Although we do not have a large number of serving ones, we should each pick up this burden to learn the truth, to preach it everywhere, and to bring ten others into the knowledge of the truth and perfect them to do what we are doing.
[23]  They are able to testify to others, saying, The Bible is very good; it tells us that God created us in His image, that He chose us in Christ, and that today He has become our wisdom.
[24]  Man was placed before the tree of life, indicating that God wanted man to take Him as the highest life so that man would live out God s life in the human life.
[25]  The third great truth in the Bible is God s becoming flesh.
[26]  There are three main points concerning God s incarnation: the bringing of God into man, the accomplishment of redemption, and the termination of the old creation.
[27]  IN THE LORD S RECOVERY THE TRUTH Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4, 7; 3:15; 2 Tim 3:7, 15-16 THE LORD S RECOVERY
[28]  Today the whole earth needs the truth of the Lord that is in His Word.
[29]  Furthermore, Genesis chapter two continues to show us that when God created man, He breathed into man s nostrils the breath of life.
[30]  This breath of life became man s spirit v. 7; Job 32:8 . After reading this, many people do not understand why God created man with a spirit.
[31]  However, little by little it has been uncovered to us through the books of the Bible that the human spirit is for contacting and containing God.
[32]  The Story of the Triune God s Entering into Man
[33]  When God incarnated, the Son came with the Father and the Spirit.
[34]  When we call on the Lord, speak the Lord, and enjoy the Lord, we become beside ourselves and are filled with the Triune God inwardly and outwardly.
[35]  The proper gospel is to tell others that the only God, who is the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit became flesh, died on the cross to accomplish redemption, and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit.
[36]  Lord, bless this word by bringing all the saints into the mysteries of the truth so that we may daily learn this truth, speak this truth, and teach others regarding this central mystery in the Word.
[37]  Concerning the truth, we need to understand and explain it.
[38]  Concerning Christ, we need to experience Him and minister to others what we have experienced.
[39]  The Christ we are referring to here is not the objective Christ who is sitting in the heavens but the subjective Christ who is our life.
[40]  Hence, to experience Christ is to experience life, and to minister Christ is to minister life.
[41]  For this reason we have to study the truth again and again and practice speaking it until we are so familiar with it that we can speak it accurately even in our dreams.
[42]  Merely having the truth without experience is vanity; hence, we all need to have experience.
[43]  After we have learned the truth, we still have to experience Christ so that He may become our reality.
[44]  In this way, when we speak to people, we will not give them knowledge or doctrines, but we will minister Christ to them.
[45]  For instance, if we tell people about the benefit of Coca-Cola yet do not give them a can of Coca-Cola to drink, then no matter how interesting our speaking is, they will not be able to enjoy the benefit of Coca-Cola.
[46]  One time you may tell them that man was created in God s image, the next time you may tell them about man s fall, and then you may speak of Christ s redemption and God s dispensing.
[47]  If we do this, I believe that in five years we will become a group of wonderful saints who will not only know how to speak the truth but also will be able to minister Christ to people through the Spirit, to pray with them, and to open their eyes that they may also gain Christ and receive Jesus as their Savior.
[48]  Rather, we would endeavor to use the time to learn the truth, to know the truth, to speak the truth, to experience Christ through the truth, and to minister Christ to people by the Spirit.
[49]  IN THE LORD S RECOVERY LIFE Scripture Reading: John 10:10b; 11:25a; 1 John 1:2; 3:9; 5:12; Col 3:4a; Gal 2:20; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:2; Col 1:19; Eph 4:15, 13; 2 Pet 1:3-4 THE LORD JESUS BEING THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
[50]  The Bible tells us that the Lord Himself is the truth and the life.
[51]  If we are not clear about the truth and do not understand or know the truth, we will have no way to enjoy the Lord as our life.
[52]  Although we are humans, we have become children of God by the life of God.
[53]  Most people in Christianity completely ignore this kind of truth.
[54]  No matter how loudly they sing in the meeting Now it s no longer I that live, / But Christ the Lord within me lives when they read the advertisements, it is no longer Christ but I. A sister may notice that her favorite fabric is being sold at a fifty percent discount and that she has a good amount of savings in her bank account.
[55]  Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit is in you and me and in our spirit all the time.
[56]  If we want to talk to our spouse, we should not do it right away.
[57]  We must first have a little conversation with the Lord, saying, O Lord, my spouse is here.
[58]  If You will wear it, I will wear it; but if You will not wear it, neither will I. When you do this, you are living Christ, and the issue is that it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.
[59]  CHAPTER SEVEN PRODUCING AND FEEDING THE LAMBS THE FATHER S GLORIFICATION BEING HIS EXPRESSION
[60]  Although each of the four Gospels refers to the matter of gospel preaching, the record in the Gospel of John is the most particular.
[61]  At the end of Matthew the Lord charged the disciples to preach the gospel Matt 28:18-20 , and at the end of both Mark and Luke the Lord also gave similar charges Mark 16:15-16; Luke 24:46-48 .
[62]  I hope that you all would answer the Lord s call, forgetting about everything else and not caring about the situation of the meetings, but you would simply go forth and bear fruit, bringing the lambs into the church life.
[63]  The Gospel of John is a book on life, but John was also particularly fond of using the word truth in his writings.
[64]  Without knowing the truth or growing in life, we may still be able to lead people to be saved and baptized; however, if we lack the knowledge of the truth and the experience of Christ, we will not be able to properly fulfill the responsibility of feeding.
[65]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE KEY TO THE REVIVAL OF THE CHURCH THE LEARNING AND SERVICE
[66]  Some who have served in the church for many years do not know how to lead or help the new full-time serving ones to have a proper equipping and learning before the Lord.
[67]  Not only should they know how to preach the gospel, but they should also help the saints to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel, even to the extent that they would force all the saints to open their homes.
[68]  Not only should the full-timers learn these three things, but every saint should also learn them.
[69]  Someone may ask whether it is necessary to follow a certain sequence in pursuing the truth or whether the method of teaching, reciting, testing, and praying that we used in the past is the proper way to study.
[70]  A FEW KEYS TO THE LEARNING OF THE TRUTH
[71]  Some people say that it is not easy to read the Word because they often forget what they have read.
[72]  They also say that if they have to read the life-study messages, it will be even more difficult.
[73]  What they say is not wrong; to be constituted with the truth surely requires that we pay a price.
[74]  One person s way of studying, however, may be different from another s. In order to be constituted with the truth, we need to learn some secrets.
[75]  IN THE LORD S RECOVERY THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; 18:17; Acts 8:1; 9:31; 12:1; 13:1; 14:23; Rom 16:1, 3-5a, 16, 20; 1 Cor 12:28; Rev 1:4-5a, 11 THE DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH The Body of Christ
[76]  The Church Being the Gathering of the Believers and Leaving the Church Being Improper
[77]  On the one hand, the Lord has to build the believers into the church, and on the other hand, the believers cannot leave the church.
[78]  In Matthew 18 the Lord said that if a brother refuses to hear the church, let him be just like a Gentile v. 17 . This does not mean that we should excommunicate him but that because this brother does not behave properly, we cannot regard him as a brother; instead, we should regard him as a Gentile.
[79]  Perhaps in less than a year Paul went back to these places and appointed elders for them in every church v. 23 . Those believers had been saved for no longer than a year, but the Bible still calls them the church, and there were some who became elders in the same year that they were saved.
[80]  THE BLESSING IN THE CHURCH God Crushing Satan under the Feet
[81]  Romans 16 tells us that there was a deaconess of the church in Cenchrea, Phoebe, who loved the church very much and served the church absolutely v. 1 . Then it also mentions a couple, Prisca and Aquila, who knew nothing but the church v. 3 . Wherever they were, they operated a church.
[82]  When they were in Rome, they operated the church there, and when they went to Ephesus, they also operated the church there.
[83]  For this reason we must see that wherever we are, what we need the most is the church in our place and that this church is the best church for us.
[84]  Concerning the full-timers, we need to have a kind of understanding that they are not preachers but full-time serving ones.
[85]  Because most of the saints do not have sufficient knowledge of the truth, there is the need for the full-time serving ones to pick up the burden to speak the truth to people.
[86]  When we enter into the life-studies and are filled with the Lord s word, we will be empowered by the Lord s word as the power and set on fire by the Lord s word as the consuming fire.
[87]  We should have a burden to promote the life-studies continent by continent until every household has the life-studies, and every saint has the life-studies both inwardly and outwardly.
[88]  Now, based on the information that we have received concerning the saints, we should form groups of twelve and have the full-timers help the saints, not to have a Sunday service or to form a small meeting with them, but to study the truth of the Bible together.
[89]  IN THE LORD S RECOVERY THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Rom 1:14-15; 1 Cor 9:16-17; 2 Tim 4:2a; Acts 6:4; 5:42; 10:24 THE COMPLETE AND FULL GOSPEL OF GOD
[90]  The four pillars in the Lord s recovery are the truth, life, the church, and the gospel.
[91]  The truth brings us life, life produces the church, and the church is responsible for the preaching of the gospel.
[92]  They think that the gospel tells people that they are sinners and will perish after death but that God loved the world and gave His only begotten Son to save them He was crucified to bear the sin of the world so that if they repent and believe in Him, they will not perish but will have eternal life and enjoy peace in the future, and they will also enjoy prosperity and peace in this age.
[93]  We must preach the gospel in a way that allows people to clearly see that once they believe in the Lord, their sins will be forgiven, and they will be redeemed and justified by God, reconciled to God, and accepted by God.
[94]  They should also see that at the same time they will be regenerated in their spirit, have God s life and nature, and have God dwelling in their spirit to renew them day by day and transform them moment by moment.
[95]  Romans 8 tells us that the Triune God first enters into our spirit v. 10 , then saturates our mind from our spirit, that is, enters into our soul v. 6 , and then enters into our body, giving life to our mortal bodies v. 11 . In this way, our tripartite being our spirit, soul, and body is filled with God.
[96]  In other words, to preach the gospel is to tell people that God wants to enter into man and make sinners sons of God, that these sons of God are living members of Christ for the constitution of the church, and that these ones are in the church, which is expressed in different localities, so that they can live the church life in the local churches.
[97]  When we are in a gospel meeting, we spontaneously preach the gospel, and when we are in an edification meeting, we preach the truth.
[98]  This Gospel begins with God: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality....For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace....No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him 1:1, 4, 14, 16, 18 .
[99]  When parents teach their child to speak, they do not care whether he understands or not; they simply speak to him every day.
[100]  Therefore, when we preach the gospel, we need to have the faith and boldness to speak God s word to people.
[101]  I know about the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit; I also know that Christ s humanity is mingled with divinity, that Christ s divinity is mingled with humanity, and that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.
[102]  Not only the non-Christians do not know the truth; even many Christians do not know the truth.
[103]  The truth tells us one central point: the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is dispensing Himself into us sinful, tripartite men that our sins may be forgiven and that we may receive God s life and have God Himself in us for our transformation into the sons of God.
[104]  If all of us would rise up to learn the truth, pursue the growth in life, live the normal church life, and preach the truth as the gospel, one year later every brother and sister will be strong, and the churches will also be enriched and fruitful.
[105]  May we all receive this burden and practice accordingly in every place, leading the saints to learn the truth in a serious way and encouraging them to pursue the growth in life, to go out to preach the gospel, and to bring people to the Lord and into the church.
