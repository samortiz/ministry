   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 48 Date:August 28, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER O. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My father wanted me to study theology so that I could be a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I joined a seminary in Shao-Kwan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After I graduated in 1927, I began to work as a preacher around the Hakkas people of south China.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was able to support myself and my co-workers from 1928 to 1938.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later, when I had used up my money, I prayed to the Lord for supply, and He answered my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My grandmother wanted me to get married, and after I was married, she demanded that my wife do all the manual work, such as carrying water, cutting grass, and cooking for her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was quite bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later I moved to a place and started a mission hall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not like the local church, and I felt quite dry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For eight years I did not bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have been idle for the past twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The thought of this puts me to shame before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am unable to anything, as I was unable to do anything in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have heard it and seen it, but I am still unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I need the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The things that happened to you during the past twenty or more years are over.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that from now on you will receive the supply from the brothers and sisters and the church so that your pathway will become straight.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to pay attention to two things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, your mind is very quick.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not know if you feel this way or not.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What you have learned from the Lord is not as much as you think you have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your inward experience does not match your outward mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are a very smart person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the Lord made you strong and powerful inwardly, your inward condition would match your outward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The outer man of some people cannot match their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With you, it is the opposite; your inner man cannot match your outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You should pay attention to this first.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, you have to restrict yourself and be a little more weighty in your ordinary conversation with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some terms and expressions should be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am afraid that in your ministry of the word, your own clever and flippant words sometimes slip out of your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A clever word is never as effective as a weighty word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not saying that you have said anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am saying that you have to pay attention to how you say things at ordinary times.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have to learn a lesson here: Your words are not weighty enough.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your speaking is too clever and flippant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have to learn to speak weighty words.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your mind is quick, and this is not a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In spiritual things the mind should never be ahead of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every time the Lord works in us, that is, every time He deals with us, we should reap rich results from such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our emotion and mind do not have any "leakage," we will surely reap rich results.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose a brother has a problem, and he weeps and cries about it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a jovial person comes along making jokes and laughing, these jokes will nullify the tears and the weeping of the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The sorrow and pain will become less cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The same principle applies in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A clever thought or a flippant word will cancel out the desired effect a dealing should produce in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes a spiritual subject should carry a heavy weight, but a flippant word nullifies it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One cannot joke about spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's work in man can be weighty or flippant, depending on what we make of it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to reject everything that tends to reduce spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When God deals with us in a weighty way, there should be a weighty result.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the result is not weighty, there must be a leak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a water bucket receives a great quantity of water yet is never full, there must be a leak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has dealt severely with you with regards to your marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet when you speak about it, it does not sound as if you have received any deep cut from the dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is because the result has leaked away.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Bearing the cross does not mean that we are nonchalant about things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It means that we accept these things for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our brother has to ask the Lord to restrict his thoughts, and he has to guard against diluting spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His inward being has to be strong, and his mind has to be under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If he can do this, his spirit will be strong, and he will become more useful in the ministry of God's word.</S>
