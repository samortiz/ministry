<h2 class="head2">The Rejection of the Leading in the Body<br />Being the Rejection of All Leadings</h2><p>We have to ask God to do one thing today: If a person rejects the leading in the Body, he will be deprived of all leadings. The Lord's leading in the work is manifested in the Body. If we pay our attention to our individual ways, we will miss God's leading. Whether it is the work or the services, everything is carried out in the Body. An individual can do something, but what he does is different from what the Body can do. The work of an individual is fragmentary and not related to God's move. The works whose basis is the individual are either empty or unsubstantial. If a man stands on the right ground, he has the right works to do. If he does not stand on the right ground, his works are empty even if he does some works. A man can be very busy, but in God's eyes, he can be very idle. An idle person is not one with nothing to do. An idle person is one whose work does not count in the Lord's eyes. When I have no part in God's work and God does not recognize what I do and when I am only busy doing my own works instead, I am an idle person. A man can be very busy and still miss the Lord and see Him pass him by.</p><h2 class="head2">Taking the Corporate Leading<br />Being Wiser Than Taking Individual Leadings</h2><p>In God's work we have to learn to accept the corporate leadings. I am not saying that there are no longer individual leadings of the Lord, nor am I saying that corporate leadings can never be wrong. It is impossible for corporate leadings to always be right; there are times when they can be wrong. But we can ask ourselves whether we have leadings in our individual works, and whether we have ever made any mistakes in those leadings. It is possible for individual leadings to be wrong, and it is equally possible for corporate leadings to be wrong. But proportionally speaking, the decision of ten men ahead of me is surely better than my own decision. We have to learn to be a receiving vessel before the Lord. We should accept the judgment of the brothers ahead of us and take their judgments as our own judgments. We should take others' judgments and be able to have others take our judgments. If you know that a young one has done something that you know is wrong, and if through the lack of learning the proper lesson, you dare not speak to him, you are allowing him to perpetuate his mistakes. If I want to go to Taiwan today and eight or ten brothers say that I should go to Tsingtao, I should submit to their judgment.</p><p>Sometimes an individual may feel very strongly and convincingly about something, and the feeling may differ from that of the Body. However, though feelings may differ, the spirit must not differ. I am here to do God's will, and you are also here to do God's will. When everyone is here to do God's will, there will not be a difference in our spirit. If you complain or are angry, your spirit is wrong, and your emotions are also wrong. If you say, "Why not ask me to go to other places? Why, of all places, should I go to Tsingtao?'', your spirit is not right. If you say that you are going to be a preacher and your father insists that you apply for a job in the Customs Department, you cannot argue with him or lose your temper by breaking dishes and cups around the house. Although you cannot take his suggestion, you still have to say to him, "Father, I would very much like to take your advice. But I cannot obey you, because there is no way that I can be the same as you are.'' If your spirit is wrong, the result will not be pleasant. Not only does your spirit have to be the same; it has to be right.</p><p>In the church the brothers who are in authority should learn to pray together. The basic principle of service in the church is the one accord. In the Bible there is no such thing as the minority going along with the majority; there is only the one accord. One can gather a few dozen saints to fellowship and pray together. If a group of people fasts and prays together in the church, they will surely speak the same thing. It is all right for a person to have some feelings of his own. But if he does not have the absolute confidence that what he has is of the Lord, it is better for him to submit to others' feelings.</p>
