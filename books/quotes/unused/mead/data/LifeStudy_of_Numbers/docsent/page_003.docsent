   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A COMPARISON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this point, I would like to make a comparison between Numbers and Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Leviticus stresses the redeemed's worship and living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Numbers stresses the redeemed's journey and fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Leviticus God's redeemed were instructed in how to worship God and live a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Numbers God's redeemed were formed into an army and fought for Him throughout their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Numbers we can see three things: the formation of an army, the journeys of that army, and the fighting of the army.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The formation of the army was for fighting, and the fighting required the army to journey, not to stay in one spot.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Always the children of Israel were going on from place to place to gain ground that God might have a people to be built up for His kingdom and His house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, in Numbers we have the army, the journey, and the fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE GENERAL SKETCH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Numbers is a long book, the general sketch is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The general sketch of Numbers is that the redeemed and sanctified Israelites were formed into a holy army of God, which was to proceed by following God's leading and was to fight for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever is written in the Pentateuch, the five books of Moses, is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In particular, in these books we see that the entire nation of Israel was a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Israel was formed into an army, so the church should be formed into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning this, we should not look at the present situation, at the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do this, we will be disappointed and wonder where the army is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we may have doubts about the existence of a church army, Satan knows that there is such an army.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to believe that today there is an army formed with all the faithful ones, journeying and fighting all the time that God may have a kingdom with a house.</S>
