   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>VERSUS ASCETICISM Scripture Reading: Col 2:20-23 ONE PERSON AND ONE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His economy God gives us one Person and one way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The one Person is the preeminent, all-inclusive Christ, and the one way is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the all-inclusive One, Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is God, man, and the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has given us this marvelous Person to be our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The one Person, Christ, is the center of the universe; and the one way, the cross, is the center of God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God governs everything by the cross and deals with everything by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, just as Christ is the focal point of the universe, so the cross is the center of God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this book Paul points out to the Colossians that nothing should become a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ should not be replaced by ordinances, observances, mysticism, or philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is everything and must not be replaced by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the previous message we covered the matter of Christ versus mysticism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Colossians mysticism includes Gnosticism and asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is versus all manner of isms.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is versus every kind of replacement and substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have pointed out that all the positive things in the universe are shadows of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, our houses are a shadow of Christ as the real dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since Christ is the substance of all the shadows, we should not allow the shadows to be a substitute for the One who is the body, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How foolish to take shadows in place of the reality!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The book of Colossians makes it clear that the all-inclusive Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s intention is not to give us thousands of items; it is simply to give us one Person, the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Midway through chapter two, Paul begins to show us that the cross is God s unique way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s way is not asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not to humble ourselves, to abase ourselves, or to treat ourselves severely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The one way is the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the cross God has dealt with all the negative things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, God is still governing everything through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we have one Person and one way; that is, we have Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>NO PLACE FOR ASCETICISM</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this message we shall go on to see that the experience of Christ s death is versus asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Christian life there is no place for asceticism, no place for treating the body severely in the attempt to restrict the indulgence of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Asceticism is not God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, it is a human invention, a product of man s fallen mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hindus and Buddhists may practice asceticism, but Christians should not.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Asceticism is part of the elements of the world spoken of in 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These elements are the elementary principles of outward, material things, the childish teachings of externalism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These elements denote the rudimentary teachings of both Jews and Gentiles, teachings that consist of asceticism and of ritualistic observances in meats, drink, and washings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is an elementary principle of asceticism to mistreat the body or to treat ourselves severely in an effort to suppress the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s way, the way of the cross, is altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the economy of God s salvation, the cross is God s central way in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, most Christians see little of the cross in relation to the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For the most part, Christians appreciate the physical aspect of the cross, the aspect that can be observed with human eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in verses 14 and 15 there is a window through which we can see into the spiritual side of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Christ was on the cross, He was not only suffering; He was working to accomplish redemption by bearing our sins and by doing the Father s will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God was also working, wiping out the handwriting in ordinances by nailing it to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we have pointed out, the evil angelic rulers and authorities were busy also, having come to interfere with what God and Christ were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But God stripped them off, triumphed over them in the cross, and put them to an open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, on the physical side, the Roman soldiers and the Jewish religionists were also very active.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because all this activity was brought to a focus on the cross, the cross became God s eternal, central, and unique way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I wish to emphasize the fact that God s way is not asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No Christian should practice asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As believers in Christ, we are not a joyless people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the contrary, we are a joyful people, those who constantly rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why then should we inflict pain on our bodies or mistreat ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How foolish!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our way, the unique way, is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the experience of the cross is versus asceticism.</S>
