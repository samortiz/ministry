        <h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST BEING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>God is a mystery, and Christ is also a mystery. The Bible reveals that the mystery of God is Christ and that the mystery of Christ is the church (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4-6). The church is the mystery of Christ. In other words, the church is the image, expression, and explanation of Christ. We should not think that <em>church</em> refers to a chapel. The church is not a chapel. Furthermore, the church as a mystery does not refer merely to a gathering of a group of people who have been saved and called out by God. Even though we may know the outward appearance of a person&rsquo;s physical body, we do not know his thoughts, ideas, emotions, moods, or intents, nor do we know his spiritual constitution. We do not know his inner person, because his real person cannot be fully expressed or represented by the members of his body. Every believer is a part of the church; hence, the believers collectively are the church. However, this is only an outward description of the church. The church has a deeper and more intrinsic aspect. The intrinsic aspect of the church is Christ.</p>
<p>When a brother is saved, others can see that he has believed in Jesus and that he is going to meetings, but they may not know what has happened within him. Even the brother himself may not be able to explain what has happened. Something has happened within him, but he cannot explain it. That he cannot explain it speaks of a mystery. Before he was saved, he easily lost his temper, went to movie theaters, played cards for relaxation, and even cursed or hit people. But one day he believed in the Lord, prayed, and called upon His name. Then something happened within him. When he wanted to lose his temper, a voice within him would say, &ldquo;Do not lose your temper. Stop.&rdquo; Before he was saved, he felt better when he lost his temper. But after his salvation he no longer felt good when he lost his temper, because Someone within him was bothering him. This Someone is the Lord Jesus Christ. Others may not understand, but we know that a living person is in us. This living person is the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is in us. Some people say that we can neither see Him nor feel Him. It is true that we cannot see Him, but it is inaccurate to say that we cannot feel Him. Sometimes we are not aware of Him, but at other times we sense that He is bothering us. Previously, no one could control us when we lost our temper. Now, however, when we lose our temper, He not only regulates us; He may even rebuke us, asking, &ldquo;Why do you lose your temper when you are wrong?&rdquo; Every believer has had such experiences.</p>
<p>Christ is the true and living Lord. He is the Spirit, who indwells us. Christians can be living, strong, and unafraid of persecution and can overcome sin and darkness because of the Lord. Before a person is saved, he might be easily tempted to sin, but after he is saved, he does not so easily waver when he is tempted. He can even overcome temptations, because there is power within him. This living power is Christ. Christ is the life-giving Spirit in us. This is the experience of Christ in us.</p>
<p>Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were alone, but now we are no longer alone; there is a person in us. This person is the Lord Jesus. He is so good that we often thank and praise Him. Sometimes, however, He bothers us and does not let us go. A sister may want to buy a dress, but the Lord does not want her to buy it. Therefore, He expresses His feeling and gives her the sense that He does not agree. If the sister insists on buying the dress, He will bother her. While she is talking with the salesperson, He may say, &ldquo;Why are you bargaining with him? Go home. Do not buy it.&rdquo; The sister is talking to the salesperson, but the Lord is talking to her. She may become unhappy or even angry, but the Lord does not get angry. If the sister continues to insist, she will not have peace, because the Lord will continue to tell her that He does not approve of her purchase. He may bother her so much that she is unable to eat well or sleep well for a few days. This is an experience of Christ living in us.</p>
<p>As Christians in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have been captivated by Christ; He has charmed us. We have many meetings every week, and we always go to the meeting hall. We go to the meeting hall after work, and we also go to the meeting hall on holidays. Our relatives and friends do not understand why we are more interested in going to the meeting hall than in traveling or sightseeing. In the meeting hall there are only Bibles, hymnals, and spiritual books. Our relatives and friends may even follow us to the meeting in order to find out what we are doing. In the meeting hall they only see people singing hymns, praying, and listening to the Lord&rsquo;s word. Because they cannot understand what we are doing, the church is a mystery to them.</p>
<p>Even though I was young when I believed in the Lord Jesus, I went to the meetings frequently because I was touched by the Lord. As a result, my mother said to me, &ldquo;I also believe in Jesus, but I only go on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. Why do you go to three meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day? You go to one in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening. Why do you also go to so many meetings during the week?&rdquo; At that time I was about twenty-one years old. I did not enjoy anything other than going to the meetings. Even if it was pouring rain, I would not be happy unless I went to the meeting. As soon as I stepped into the meeting hall, I was happy. When I sat down, I forgot all my troubles. This is a mystery.</p>
<p>Christ is a mystery, and Christ in us is also a mystery. The Christ in you is not separate from the Christ in me. Christ in us can be likened to electricity. We can be likened to many light bulbs through which the electrical current flows.</p>
<p>Christ is flowing through all of us, and His flowing connects us. We are joined together as one entity because of Christ, through Christ, and in Christ; this one entity is the church. Strictly speaking, you are not the church, and I am not the church; we are not the church. The church is the Christ in you, in me, and in all of us. The church is Christ in His believers. If Christ had not entered into us, He would still be Christ but not the church. When He enters into us, He becomes the church.</p>
<p>The church is not Christ in heaven, nor is it Christ outside of us. Christ must enter into us in order to be the church. The church is a mystery because Christ in us is a mystery. The church is profound and mysterious. The church is not a chapel, nor is it merely a gathering of a group of people who believe in Jesus. The church is Christ in all the saints.</p>
<p>We are God&rsquo;s called ones, and we have Christ in us. If we are full of criticism and arguments when we come together, we are not the church. The church is Christ being expressed through us. When we gather together and exhibit Christ, we are the church. The church is not merely a gathering together of a group of people. The church is Christ in us and Christ being lived out from us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
