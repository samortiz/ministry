   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE PRAYER AND FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REGARDING SPECIFIC WORKS Scripture Reading: Matt 6:31-33; Rom 12:1-2, 11 SEEKING FIRST GOD S KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 6:31-32 says, Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we become anxious regarding what to eat and drink and what to wear, our eating, drinking and clothing will become our burden, and we will become the same as the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Almost all human beings, regardless of place or time, are anxious for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man s living cannot be separated from the two aspects of eating and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our eating signifies what we need inwardly, and our clothing signifies what we need outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether a person is rich or poor, he is anxious for his eating and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter what a person s degree of eating and clothing is, this is an unalterable principle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the Lord Jesus said, I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on v. 25 . This is the Lord s command, the Lord s charge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 32a the Lord said, For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not need to imitate them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second half of the verse says, For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This can be considered a fact or a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the head of the household, every proper father cares for his whole family, including his children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the spiritual realm we also have a Father, the heavenly Father, who knows all of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we may have never treasured this word in Matthew 6.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to thank the Father for this, saying, O Father, I really worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thank You, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I become anxious concerning what to eat and what to put on, I will offend You because this is what the Gentiles do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They do not have a heavenly Father, so they are anxious for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this should not be the case with me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have a heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not need to be anxious for all these things because You know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verses 31-32a the Lord gives us a command, saying, Do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not follow the custom of the Gentiles, being anxious about what to eat and drink and what to wear every day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what they talk about all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have a heavenly Father, and He knows all that we need regarding food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord said, But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you v. 33 . Here it does not say that we need to beseech but to seek, meaning to find.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What we seek should be God s kingdom and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We not only need to pray or beseech, but we also need to find.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to first find God s kingdom and His righteousness, and then what we need will be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first half of this word seek first His kingdom and His righteousness is a command, and the second half all these things will be added to you is a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not say that all these things would be given to us; He said that they would be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Besides God s kingdom and God s righteousness, He has to add to us all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a similar way, when we buy something at a store, the store may give us a small gift that does not cost anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is something added.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today God s kingdom is the church, and God s righteousness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we seek God s kingdom but are detached from the church and do not live the church life, then we are not truly seeking God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today God s kingdom is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 14:17 says, For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The kingdom of God is the church, and the righteousness of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come to the church and live the church life, we are seeking the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we live Christ, we are seeking God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, we have both the kingdom and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, when we have the church life, we have Christ as well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Does the heavenly Father give us only these things?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No, He adds to us our food, our clothing, our transportation, our traveling, and our housing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All that we need regarding food, clothing, housing, and transportation are added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have been saved for sixty-two years and have been serving the Lord for fifty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have never seen anyone who seeks God s kingdom and His righteousness suffer from hunger, coldness, or a lack of food, clothing, housing, or transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the contrary, all those whom I saw were in the church, living Christ and living the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ultimately, they had God s kingdom and His righteousness, and God also added to them the four essential requirements for living food, clothing, housing, and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, these three verses in Matthew 6 contain a command, a warning, a fact, and a promise.</S>
