   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>O LORD, AMEN, HALLELUJAH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We love to say the four words "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the verses from Revelation, we have seen "Amen" and "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where then can we find "O Lord"?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In many pages of the Psalms, it is so easy to find "O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, these four words are not something we have invented, but something we have discovered in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When reading the Psalms in the past, we may have entirely passed over these two little words, "O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we use these two words and pray-read the Psalms again, it will be a new book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last five Psalms, Psalms 146-150, all begin and end with "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means "Praise ye the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, these five Psalms are called the Hallelujah Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every Psalm begins with "Hallelujah" and ends with "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So, in the Psalms we have "O Lord" and "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all must exercise ourselves to say these four words: "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE NEED OF PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In learning to do anything, a certain amount of practice is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the beginning it is not so convenient, but by practice, we gradually learn how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe that we will gradually learn how to pray-read the Word in a better way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are still at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you regulate anything at the beginning, you will kill it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must let it grow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a little plant grows, you should not touch it too much.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you regulate it, you will kill it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But you should gradually adjust it a little.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same way, our pray-reading of the Word will gradually need a little adjustment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For instance, sometimes we do not take care of others when pray-reading in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all say something at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At other times everybody stops.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we lack balance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because our technique is not yet so adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have not practiced enough so that we have a balanced and coordinated pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may have a living pray-reading, but not a balanced and coordinated pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need practice, but we must not regulate too much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not make a form out of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are living persons with some regulations, yet with nothing formal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to acquire some skill and technique.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes basketball players who are well coordinated play slowly and then suddenly play very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, we may pray-read quickly, and then slow down a little.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes we may pray-read loudly and then silently.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And sometimes we may have the leading of the Lord to all read together and say "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The main thing is practice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It takes practice to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Another thing we have learned from our experience in pray-reading is that at the beginning all may pray together at the same time for about two minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is like the sound of many waters, the voice of mighty thundering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But after two or three minutes, we should pray-read one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then when we hit a strategic point, everybody may pray-read together loudly, but after a few minutes, all the voices will calm down again to pray-read one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is similar to playing the piano: not every key is struck at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some are struck softly while others are struck loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This makes beautiful music.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our pray-reading should be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the beginning we all pray together, but gradually we pray-read one by one until we reach a crescendo.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This requires coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are no regulations, but we all need to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE BALANCE OF THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This does not mean that we do not need the teaching of the Word, but it is more important that the spirits of all the saints be released and nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The messages are mostly to open our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is helpful, but it does not nourish and feed the spirit as much as pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need the feeding, the releasing and the stirring up of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In every meeting, we must first release and feed the spirit of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Subsequently, we may have some message from the Lord to open our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We not only have a spirit, but also a soul; hence, for the spirit we need the pray-reading, and for the soul we need the understanding to be opened to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the right way to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I do not mean that we do not need any solid and living teaching, but teachings alone are not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why do we always say that it is not teachings we need, but the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We say this because Christianity stresses teaching too much and neglects the feeding and nourishing of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everyone can pray-read, but not everyone is a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some have the teaching gift, but most do not.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even a short message cannot be given by anyone; yet everyone can pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The whole congregation must pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By doing this, the priesthood in the church will be greatly helped and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>THE WEAKER VESSELS</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is another matter regarding the pray-reading that must be mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That is, the sisters must exercise a little boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because the brothers are bold, it is rather difficult for the sisters to get a chance to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I noticed that in the sisters' meetings there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The sisters are bold in that kind of meeting, but in the regular meetings of the church, the sisters must be more bold and enter quickly into the pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The brothers, however, must sympathize with the weaker vessels and share the time with them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But the brothers must not wait too long; otherwise, the meeting will be deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all must learn to "season" the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Of course, this requires practice.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I believe that the Lord as the living Spirit will lead us in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Henceforth, we are in the stage of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must give up our background, leave all the old ways, and follow the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He is so living; He is ever fresh and ever new.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This will cause a real release of the spirit in the function of our meetings.</S>
