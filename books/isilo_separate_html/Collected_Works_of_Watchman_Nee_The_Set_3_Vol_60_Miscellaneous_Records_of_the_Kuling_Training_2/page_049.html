In the conversion of the three thousand and the five thousand in Acts 2 and 4 and in the outpouring of the Spirit in the house of Cornelius, the Bible does not say anything about the laying on of hands. It is clear that through the baptism of the Holy Spirit all the members were baptized into one Body. First Corinthians 12:13 says that all the believers have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. There is no need to have any additional procedure, but in Samaria and Ephesus we find the laying on of hands (Acts 8:14-17; 19:6). This is because those two instances were somewhat special. The Samaritans had no contact with the Jews. When some in Samaria became believers, they needed the laying on of hands to usher them into the fellowship of the Body. The disciples in Ephesus who received the laying on of hands were baptized through the baptism of John, and they had to be brought into the fellowship of the Body.</p><p>Hebrews 6 speaks of baptisms in the plural. This refers to the many Jewish ordinances regarding purification. At the time Hebrews was written, the temple was still there, and many Hebrew believers were still under the influence of their Jewish background. The same can be said about the ordinance regarding purification in Acts 21.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING FOOT-WASHING</h2><p>Foot-washing is a sign of Christ's humility. It is an actual practice, not just an illustration. The Lord's word in John 13:14 shows that He intended for His disciples to learn this lesson of humility. This is a personal gesture and act (cf. 1 Tim. 5:10); it is not something done in a corporate way. The same can be said about kissing. At the time the Lord was on the earth, foot-washing was a common Jewish practice. The Jews wore loose sandals. When they entered a house, they first needed to wash their feet. This was something that a servant would do. This is like the Chinese who offer guests a wash basin and a cup of tea before serving the meal. This practice is not found in other countries. If the Lord were in China, He could have said, "I am the host. Today I am serving you towels to wash your face. This is the work of a servant. Yet I am doing this with the hope that you would do the same to others."</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE CUP</h2><p>Concerning the cup, it is better to have one cup. If anyone is afraid of this practice, he can drink with a straw.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING RECOGNIZING A CO-WORKER</h2><p>The highest test in recognizing a co-worker is whether or not one can touch him with his spirit. We have to recognize men with our spirit. Unless we do this, we can easily be deceived.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
