   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A DRUNKARD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following is a drunkard's will which was found on a chair in his room after he had committed suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It concerns a very sober and tragic matter: "What I am leaving to the world is a detestable character and corrupted example.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What I am leaving to my parents is unbearable sorrow in their failing age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What I am leaving to my brothers and sisters is my extreme shame and dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What I am leaving to my wife is a broken heart and a shameful life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What I am leaving to every one of my children is poverty, illiteracy, poor character, and the memory of a father lying in a drunkard's tomb, going into a drunkard's hell."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>SAFE IN THE ARMS OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day, two sisters were playing and singing, "Safe in the arms of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The older sister asked the younger one, "How do you know that you are safe?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The younger one answered, "When my hands are holding the Lord's hand, I know that I am safe."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The older sister said, "What if Satan comes to snatch you away from the Lord's hand?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can you still be safe?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The younger one changed her countenance, and she thought for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then she said, "Oh, I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the Lord's hand that is holding my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan cannot snatch from His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore I am safe."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus said, "No one shall snatch them out of My hand" John 10:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>MISSING THE TRAIN BUT GAINING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was nine o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The 8:50 train had paused and left the beautiful station after all the passengers had boarded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One old stationmaster had been working in the company for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the exciting activity of the last train, he lay back to rest for an hour in front of the little garden filled with flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was his reward for his hard work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suddenly there were some rapid footsteps followed by a man rushing in. His anger could as easily be detected as the redness on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Though his impatience and annoyance made him somewhat short of words, he was nevertheless harshly rebuking the driver for the latter's negligence in waking him up to catch the train.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"I was willing to pay you twenty-five dollars; I did not want to see myself missing the train.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What should I do now?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, under such circumstances the only proper thing to do was to wait quietly for the ten o'clock train to arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the poor man was not yet resolved in his mind as to what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The stationmaster was a kind and diligent person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had met such cases many times before, and he knew what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said, "The best thing to do is to leave him alone, because soon he will recover."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, he patiently waited, until the pace of the man's walking on the platform slowed down.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then he spoke up, "Sir, here is a comfortable waiting room.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Would you care to come in and sit down?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The man turned and followed him into the small and cozy room.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Outside the window were some climbing roses, and the air was clean.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the midst of the room was a round table with many tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These were little God-sent messengers for weary travelers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They were all appropriately designed and could easily attract people's attention.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The passenger was happy to have something to do while he was waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He flipped through the tracts, picked up one of them, sat down, and began to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By that time, the stationmaster had returned to his little garden.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He thought to himself, "What a quiet day!"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A little later he looked up at the clock and realized that the next train was about to come.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some passengers had arrived, and the ticket booth had opened, and they were waiting for the next train to come.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first passenger was still sitting in the waiting room reading the tract.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was a long article, and he was fully absorbed in what it said, to the extent that he had forgotten the time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The stationmaster said, "Sir, the train is about to arrive."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He jumped up from his chair as one who just woke up from sleep and shouted, "The train is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Will you sell this tract to me?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I want to finish it."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Sir, you can take it with you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am more than happy for you to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A kind lady gave these to me, and I am sure she would be happy for you to have it."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Thank you, and please thank her for me."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A minute later, the man was on the train.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One month later, the stationmaster was on the same platform.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the train stopped, a passenger jumped out of the train car and stood in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He stretched out his hand and said, "Do you recognize me?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"Sir, I still recognize you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You are the frustrated person who missed the train a few weeks ago."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"I could have avoided that.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But that morning though I missed the train, I gained the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How wonderful was that tract!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Previously, I was always busy with my business, and I had no time to think about God or read any book about God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But I could not avoid the serious questions posed by the tract.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I wish I could have the time to tell you everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But you can tell the lady who gave you the tracts that they have led me to the Lord Jesus, and I have done my best to buy and give away many tracts to others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have never experienced greater joy."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The sound of the train whistle interrupted their conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The old stationmaster was happy at heart when he saw the train slowly leaving the station with one passenger glowing with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"One new creation created in Christ Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>BEING FILLED THROUGH WORKING FOR THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One zealous but poor believer always attended the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>She always brought her friends and relatives along to listen to the sermon, and her face was always filled with unspeakable joy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When her friends and relatives met her, they always said, "You must have struck a fortune after you became a believer!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Before, you worked seven days a week, but were still short of your daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now you do not work on Sunday, yet you still have enough to live on!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Probably you have struck some fortune!"</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>She answered with a smile, "I do not have any riches in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But I have received the heavenly inheritance and exhaustless treasures in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I still have to work to earn my living.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But every Lord's Day, I stop my work for the Lord's sake and consecrate the Lord's Day to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>On Sunday I am busy attending meetings for breaking bread and busy attending services; I am busy inviting people to come and busy testifying to others.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It does not mean that I can earn my living without working.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But when I am so busy working for the Lord, my stomach is filled already."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Bible says, "If anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat" 2 Thes 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Lord Jesus said, "I have food to eat...My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work" John 4:32, 34 .</S>
