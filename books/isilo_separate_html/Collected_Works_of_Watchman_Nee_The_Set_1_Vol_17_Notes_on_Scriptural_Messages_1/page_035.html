"Learn from Me"</H2><P>Not only do we have to take the yoke, we also have to learn from the Lord. The Lord's pattern is recorded in Philippians 2:6-8: "Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross." There are two things we should consider concerning the Lord's pattern.</P><P>The first is that the Lord did not stand up to speak for His own right. "Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself." This is to forsake His legal right. Originally, our Lord was equal with God, having the same glory and sharing the same authority. He was the same as God. However, He did not uplift Himself; on the contrary, He emptied Himself and took the form of a slave. Originally, there was nothing wrong with His being equal with God. He was not like the devil, who was a created being, an archangel, yet who tried to lift himself up to become equal with God. The Lord was totally opposite from the devil. He did not strive to become equal with God; rather, He emptied Himself. Therefore, we have to remember that none of us should speak anything for our own rights. Everyone should give up his legal right willingly and joyfully.</P><P>There was a sister who lived like a king at home. After she believed in the Lord, she became like a servant. If she wanted some pocket money from her parents, they would not give it to her so willingly as before. However, she was willing to forsake the position and right she had as their child. Since we belong to Christ, we should not expect our parents to treat us like regular children or our friends to treat us as nice as before. If they do not provide for you, you cannot beg. You ought to place yourselves in the hand of God and learn from Him. "Who, existing in the form of God...emptied Himself." He never spoke anything for Himself; we also should not speak anything for ourselves.</P><P>The rest in our Christian life lies not only in not taking advantage of others, but in being able to endure when others take advantage of us. Many young Christians took advantage of others before they believed in the Lord. After they believe in the Lord, they begin to treat others justly. Now when they see others being unjust, they become indignant. Little do they realize that the Christian standard does not stop merely at being just but at enduring the unjust. What the Lord received was not justice. If it had been according to justice, the Lord would have had no need to come to be a man and would not have needed to save man. But for our sake, He was willing to endure all kinds of unjust treatment.</P><P>The second matter is His "taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men." This is to say that He became limited. Originally when our Lord was in the heavens, He could come and go freely like the angels; He could also appear to man like the angels did in the Old Testament. However, He descended to the earth and was made in the likeness of men to become an infant and then an adult. He grew up year after year in the human way; like all other men, He also needed to eat, drink, sleep, work, and rest. This is the limitation on His divinity that He received. However, He was not only made in the likeness of men, but also took the form of a slave. Although He had given up His freedom as God, He could still have His freedom as a man, and He could still enjoy whatever the other men could enjoy. Yet He took the form of a slave and sacrificed even the freedom He had as an ordinary man. In every aspect He endured the entanglement and limitations which are unbearable to man. Besides God's-the Father's-will, He did not know anything else. This was the restriction on His humanity. Although He was God, He was limited. Although He was a man, He was limited. How about us? Our hearts would rather rebel. How we wish to break off all the entanglements and restrictions so that we can move freely. How we wish everything and everyone in the world would go along with our desires and according to our hearts' delight. We are not like the Lord; although He was God, He still was restricted. Among us, many mothers would wish not to be mothers but would prefer to go out to preach the word freely instead. There was a wife who once told me that if her husband would allow her, she would leave her three children behind and go to Tibet to preach the gospel. She thought that it would be wonderful if she could break all the entanglements and fly away. However, this is not the Lord's pattern. The Lord was God, but He still obeyed His parents and took care of His younger brothers and sisters. We ought to obey and not be ambitious. Since God has used your children to limit you and your family to restrict you, you should submit willingly and joyously. It is wrong for a businessman to think, "It would be nice if I did not have to be in business," or a student to think, "It would be nice if I did not have to study." It would be wrong for a worker to think, "It would be nice if I did not have to work," and for a teacher to think, "It would be nice if I did not have to teach." If we would be like our Lord who accepts all kinds of restriction without any struggling, we would have rest.</P><P>Therefore, an unbeliever can have rest, the rest of being reconciled to God. At the same time, if a worrisome, restless, and troubled Christian is willing to bear the yoke of meekness and lowliness, learn from the Lord's limitation, and not stand up to speak for his own rights day after day, but is willing to accept the yoke which God has apportioned to him day after day and choose for himself a life of restriction, he will surely have rest in his heart.</P><P>The Lord said, "For My yoke is easy and My burden is light." Every person who is experienced in the Lord will say "amen" to this. How rough are the roads we have chosen for ourselves! How troublesome are the things which we do according to our own desire! How pitiful are the consequences and how many difficulties there are along the way! If we are willing to take up the Lord's yoke and learn from Him, we will see that the things He gives us, the demand he has upon us, and the environment which He has arranged for us are all easy and light. Nothing that He causes us to pass through is unbearable for us. He knows how to apportion His yoke; He knows our strength. We can be at rest. He will not require of us what we cannot do. Whatever He apportions is what each brother and sister can bear. As one would not put an iron yoke on a three-month-old calf, the Lord will not ask a person to encounter something in his environment that he cannot endure. Before something comes upon us, God has already decided that we are able and have the strength to pass through such a thing. God does not make a mistake. Therefore, we should not murmur. Instead, we should quietly, humbly, gently, and joyfully accept all the yokes and burdens He gives us, even though many of these are not according to our desire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CORRESPONDENCE</H2><P>Our sister, Miss Ruth Lee, because of her health, is now in Sha Ming Tung On receiving the rest she needs. I hope the readers will not forget her in their prayers.</P><P>Brother Lien-chun Wang, who is most one with us in the Lord's truth, came to Shanghai at the beginning of March and stayed with us until the middle of April before returning to Foochow. During this time of a little more than a month, we have had fellowship and have learned profitable lessons in the Lord.</P><P>Sister Pearl Wang went to Chia-shing in the middle of March; at the beginning of April, she went to Soochow for meetings; all have the blessings of the Lord. Brother Watchman Nee went to Japan at the end of March to work for a week. On April 11, we had Mr. Ming Cheng Lan, Miss Wei Ching Siou, and Miss Moo Jeir Chirk baptized to enter into Christ. We thank the Lord for all these works!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
