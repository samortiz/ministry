The Beginning and Development<br />of the Meeting in Ying Pien</h2><p>This locality is on the westernmost border of our region. It is joined to Shou Ning. Although it used to belong to the China Inland Mission, its roots are somewhat different than the other localities. A brother from among us, Ts'ai Ch'i, did some edification work among them not long after the denomination had been established. Therefore, they understood the truth more easily than the brothers in the other localities. Furthermore, one of the brothers among them, Su Pi Chung, loved the Lord very much and did much for the church. He was very hungry and thirsty in the pursuit of the truth. He read The Christian and other publications from the Gospel Book Room in 1925. We can say that he was a burning star and was instrumental in turning them away from the denominations. Later, they were helped by the co-workers; they left the denomination in 1929. The leaders of the denomination would not let them go. They often sent workers to them. Although the brothers still received the workers, they would not let go of the matters of the truth. Although the denomination used many methods to try to accommodate them, they stood fast to the end and even debated with them hotly. In the end, the brothers discharged the workers boldly. In 1931 they completely severed their relationship with the denomination. Later, because too many people were meeting in a very small place, they built a meeting hall in 1932 with a capacity of one hundred people. The condition of the meetings is better and more zealous than before because God manifested His special protection among them last year. The region had a severe epidemic of dysentery. Many Gentiles died from it, but not one person in the Lord died. This was a great wonder to the Gentiles, and many in the believers' families also believed. After this epidemic, the number of Gentiles who believed increased gradually. Now there are twenty-one brothers and sisters in the table meeting. There are twenty-eight people who come to hear the message but who do not partake of the table yet. Brothers Su Pi Chung and Su Ting K'ai mainly preach the messages on the Lord's Day and handle the affairs of the meeting. There are a few older brothers who help sometimes. These elderly brothers are very precious because they are so zealous. They are like old eagles who have returned to their youth. They can be a pattern to us all in coming to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">14. The Condition of the Meetings<br />in Chou Pien and Shih Yang</h2><p>These two localities originally belonged to the China Inland Mission. They were originally shepherded by the same teacher as Hsiu Hsi Pien and Ying Pien. When the brothers in Ying Pien and Hsiu Hsi Pien left the denomination, the teachers left. The denomination considered these two localities as a burden and abandoned them. The members of these two localities did not leave the denomination for the sake of the truth but instead followed us after being spit out by the denomination. Therefore, we dare not confess that their meetings are of God. There are jealousies, strifes, and sins among them. Although our brothers go to visit them, they have no way to correct them! They have no strength to change anything! The only thing we can do now is let them go on in their own way. There are only two or three people left in one of these two places. Although there are a few more people in the other place, the brothers are not at peace with each other. Among two flesh brothers, if the elder meets downstairs (the meeting place is downstairs), the younger will go upstairs to worship. If the younger is meeting downstairs, the elder will go upstairs to worship. They are like fire and water; they do not mix well with each other. Oh, this is such a pitiful situation!</p><h2 class="head2">15. The Beginning and Condition<br />of the Meeting in Lien T'ou</h2><p>This locality originally belonged to the China Inland Mission. It is difficult to say when or why they left the denomination. They probably left at the same time as Yang Ya or a little before that time. They left because Brother Lai from among us worked among them for a little. Not long after, they left the denomination. Later, Brother Lai left and no one continued the work there. The brothers got colder and colder over time, and many sins occurred among them. There was also a brother who had great compassion and who also loved and gave himself for the church, but unfortunately he was too bold and not wise enough. He did not do things in a measured way. If this brother had had another brother who could have directed him and could have been a helper to him, he would have been a great help to the church. Unfortunately, he did not receive any edification! He was not completely clear about the matter of the church and only understood the other truths partially. Therefore, he always acted independently. His own locality suffered, and other localities were influenced quite a bit by him. Thank the Lord and praise God! He knows the ignorance of His children and sympathizes with them. This year He prepared a brother, Yang Teh Huei, to go there to teach school on the one hand and to help the church on the other. When Brother Yang Teh Huei arrived and saw the church in this condition, he was very sad! Not long after this, Brother Lai came home from Wenchow and passed through this locality. The two of them discussed how to deal with the church there. They decided to invite the responsible brothers from a few of the localities in the area to meet with them on July 8 to specifically deal with those who had committed the six kinds of sin mentioned in 1 Corinthians 5:11 and with other matters of the administration of the church. Thank the Lord! The sinners in this locality were dealt with as were those in Hsiao Chien, Sung Hsiu Yang, and Chang An. This individualistic brother was also dealt with. He repented, grieved, shed tears, and confessed his past errors. His wife was as sad as he was! There are now twelve brothers and sisters in the table meetings. There are more than ten others who come to hear the messages but do not yet take the table. Brother Yang Teh Huei is mainly responsible for the messages and edification on the Lord's Day. Brothers Ho Teng Ch'in and Ho Teng Yung are responsible for the other affairs of the meeting.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
