   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REVELATION BEING THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Numbers 12:4 says, "And suddenly Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the Lord spoke suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suddenly means something unexpected.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Aaron and Miriam might have criticized Moses many times, but the Lord suddenly called them to the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people criticize easily and act against authority lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They speak against others loosely because they are living in their own tent; they are far away from the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a man is in his own tent, it is easy for him to criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But once he enters the tent of meeting, everything becomes clear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All three came before the tent of meeting, and Jehovah said to Aaron and Miriam, "Hear My words" v. 6a . They first questioned if it was fair that God only spoke to Moses, and now God summoned them to hear His words too.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that they had never learned to hear God's word and had never known what it was like for God to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On that day Jehovah spoke to them for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Indeed, God was speaking, but He spoke words of rebuke, not words of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was not for the manifestation of God's glory, but for the judgment of their actions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He said, "Hear My words."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was as if He were saying, "I did not say anything in the past, but let Me say something now."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word may also mean, "You have been speaking for so long and so often.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now give Me a chance to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You who are so good at speaking, listen to Me today."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A talkative person cannot hear God's word; only a meek person can hear His word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses was meek, not talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He could turn any way the Lord wanted him to turn; he could go forward or backward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But Aaron and Miriam were stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After this God said, "If there is a prophet among you..." v. 6b , as if He did not know that there was a prophet among them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It sounded as if God had forgotten something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But God said that even if there were a prophet, God would at most speak to him in a vision or in a dream v. 6c . But with Moses, God spoke mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in obscure words v. 8 . This was God's vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's speaking to Moses came in the way of revelations and light; they were very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses did not vindicate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was God who vindicated him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is true that everyone who is sent in the name of the Lord to speak to God's children has some degree of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But I do hope that you will not try to establish your own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that you will not vindicate yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation was granted to Moses alone, not to Aaron or Miriam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whoever speaks with God face to face is God's appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The establishment of authority is based upon God's choice; it is God's business, and man cannot interfere in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Neither is the annulling of authority achieved through man's reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God could appoint Moses, and He could also annul Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But whether it was appointment or annulling, it was God's business; man had no right to question it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man could not annul Moses' authority with reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man's worth before the Lord is not based on others' evaluation of him nor his own evaluation of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A man's worth before the Lord is based on revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Revelation is the standard of God's measure and valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The establishment of authority is based on God's revelation, and God evaluates a person based on revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as a person is set aside by the Lord, he loses his revelation, and God no longer speaks to him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God said that Moses was His servant and that He spoke with him mouth to mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If God grants us revelation, everything will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He does not grant us revelation, nothing will work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Aaron and Miriam complained, and God seemed to ask, "How much revelation do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All My revelation is with Moses."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to learn to be the authority, we have to consider what we are before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we set out for our work, the test is not in Aaron's or Miriam's measuring, but in God's measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If God grants us revelation, and we have a clear word from Him and face-to-face fellowship with Him, no one can annul us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if the way upward is not clear and heaven is not open to us, nothing will avail even if all the doors on earth are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If heaven is open to us, we will have God's vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will have the proof of being a son of God, that is, the proof of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the Lord was baptized, heaven opened Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Baptism is a symbol of death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the Lord was crucified on the cross, He entered death and was placed in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When darkness is at its worst, when pain reaches its height, and when all doors are shut, heaven opens.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Revelation is the basis of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must learn to not fight for ourselves or speak for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not be like Aaron or Miriam, clamoring for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If after you leave here you fight for authority, it will prove that you are in the flesh and in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It will also prove that you have not seen anything here on the mountain.</S>
