   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BIBLICAL WAY TO GAIN PEOPLE FOR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The best way to gain people for Christ is the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The biblical way is, first, to pray for people 1 Tim 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, it is to get the proper word in the Bible digested into our being so that we can use what we have digested of the Word to cherish and to nourish others 1 Tim 4:6; 2 Tim 3:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, we ourselves must be persons living on this earth with no other interest but Christ with His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our interest on this earth must be simply to live Christ with His church Phil 1:21; 3:8; 2:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, we need to make a living, get married, and have children, but all these are not our main interests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our main interest is in Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not just our work or our conduct; this is our life and this is our living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once we possess these three qualifications, we must know that we need to bear fruit John 15:1-8, 16 ; we need to produce some members for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every day we need to pray for the people around us, including our relatives, our in-laws, our schoolmates, and our neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we should digest the Word within us to become a person filled and even constituted with the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are such persons, we will gain the proper persons, and we will bring them directly to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, it will be easy for us to bring such people on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who are seeking for God, yet merely in a natural, human way, and those who like to have a religion will not come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In society, among so many people, everyone has his own taste.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not spend our time on those who are seeking for a religion so that they can have some rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is difficult to bring such people to seek after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Something in their natural being prefers to have religion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is God who created us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that I was created by God to be what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am a person who desires to sacrifice everything for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was made that way by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I love the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In knowing the Bible I have a very good memory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems that I could never forget the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Quite often I may forget a name, but it is difficult for me to forget one verse of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that I was made in such a way by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I was a young man I was very fond of playing soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day after I was saved, all of a sudden I repented, thinking that I should not play soccer any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This took place sometime after I heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the day that I heard the gospel, I was caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The gospel message I heard on that day concerned the children of Israel's being usurped by Pharaoh, who was a type of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I responded to that word, saying to myself that I would not be usurped by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We who have believed in the Lord Jesus did not do so because we ourselves are capable of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were created that way by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before we were born, God chose us Eph 1:4; 1 Pet 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God created us in such a way that we feel happy to be what we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you were to give me the entire world, making me a king, I would not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was my prayer that afternoon when I got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I walked out from that meeting, I stopped on the way home and prayed, "Lord, even if I could possess the whole earth and be a king, I would not want this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I want to follow Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I would be willing to carry a Bible and travel through the villages to preach the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today I am still the same.</S>
