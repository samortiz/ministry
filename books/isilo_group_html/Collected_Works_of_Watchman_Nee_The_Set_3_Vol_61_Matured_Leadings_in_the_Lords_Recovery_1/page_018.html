The co-workers in particular should spend time together to study the Word corporately. Every time they do this, they should spend at least three hours together.</p><h2 class="head2">The Keys</h2><h2 class="head3">Compiling and Translating</h2><p>One of the ways to study the Bible is to take a portion of the Word and compile and translate it from scratch. In translating each word, one has to compare the existing Chinese versions word for word. We can consult the writings of a few Bible teachers: Dean Henry Alford's word study, Stephen's New Testament in Greek, Young's Concordance, Newberry's Bible published by the Brethren, and F. G. Grant's and J. N. Darby's expositions.</p><p>If we are not careful and serious in our study of the Word, we can easily build a message upon a wrong translation of a word. In Romans 1:1 Paul said that he was called by God to preach the gospel of God. In Philippians 1:16 he spoke of the defense of the gospel. In Galatians 1:6-9 he pointed out that those who preached a different gospel should be accursed. Therefore, we should never consider God's Word in a light way; neither should we consider that anyone can expound it at will or preach the gospel from it. Paul told Timothy that the church is the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15) and that this truth is concerning God's divine economy (1:4). The cross, life, faith, truth, and teachings are all included in the gospel of God, which is revealed in the Scripture. The gospel of God encompasses all of God's communications with man. Paul was separated for this gospel, yet he was only a slave. God keeps His enterprise under His own hand. This is the reason Romans 11:34 says, "Who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has become His counselor?" God's gospel is God's entire divine enterprise. Paul was a slave in this enterprise. We are called by God to be slaves as well. Therefore, we should not be so presumptuous as to expound the truth by ourselves. If we do, we will become God's counselor.</p><h2 class="head3">Word Study</h2><p>The second way to study the Bible is by word study. We have to study every word and phrase in every passage carefully and thoroughly. Consider Romans 1:1. Expressions such as Christ Jesus, slave, called, apostle, separated, and the gospel of God require special attention. We have to find out how many times these expressions are used and under what circumstances they are used. We have to find the Scripture references and teachings behind these expressions and organize them a little. This will give us a basic and clear understanding of the use of these expressions. With the word separated, for example, we can note the process through which God separated Paul:</p><p>1) Separated at birth from his mother's womb (Gal. 1:15).</p><p>2) Separated to be a vessel at the time of salvation on his way to Damascus (Acts 9:3-19).</p><p>3) Separated for the work in Antioch (Acts 13:2).</p><p>In some cases, the expressions Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus are used interchangeably. However, we should not think that they are the same thing. This work is time consuming. Do not take any expression for granted. If we can dig into a few dozen of these expressions, we will have some foundation in the knowledge of the Bible.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
