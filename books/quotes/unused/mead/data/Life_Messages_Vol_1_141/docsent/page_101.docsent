   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HIS LIFE BUT YOUR LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As you go through the day, you need to realize that Christ and you have only one life, not yours but His.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this to be your experience, your own life has to be put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then you two will have only one living, not His but yours, because His is concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ask the Lord to make you clear.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Lord, thank You that You and I have one life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Show me how to take this life; show me how to put aside my life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank You, Lord, that the two of us have only one living; this is my living, not Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I thank You that the life is Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should thank me that the living is mine!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you keep praying this way, you will become clear that in the Christian life the Lord and you have only one life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In yourself you have your life; in Himself, He has His.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in Him, in His life, you are both one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This one life is your living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we pray this way, we may sense that the Lord is pleased pleased that He has a life for us and that we have a living for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>HOW TO PUT ASIDE OUR OWN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For us to experience the one life, our own life must be put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In specific terms, we must put aside both our will and our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord said, "I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me" John 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 7:17-18 He said, "If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of Him Who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord sought both the will and the glory of the One who had sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To put our will and glory aside is to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All human beings are for their own will and their own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why do we prefer to live by our own life?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is because within us we have a will concerning ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The direction of this will is to promote our name, our popularity, our position.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our will within seeks to advance our glory without.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Self-promotion characterizes human society.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone wants to be somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even in the church there are these aspirations to be someone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the church annuls every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have heard the church people criticized as being a "bunch of dummies," lacking any self-assertiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is not this a testimony that the Lord is making us different from the world?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we put down the will and the glory of the natural life, that life is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>HOW TO BE HELPED BY THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To get the most help from the Word, do not seek your own will and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are after a position for yourself, when you come to the Word the help you receive will be fragmentary at best.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Be content to be nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as you are somebody, you are taking yourself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus' baptism at the beginning of His ministry was a declaration that He was terminated, that His natural life was under the cross, and that He would live the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is when you choose such a life that the Word nourishes you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Word is not for the sustaining of your natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The intent of the Word is not to instruct you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not try to do what is taught in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Just open to Him as you open His Word and receive Him through the Word as your supply.</S>
