<P>The new ones should also be grouped together for group meetings. In the old way of having group meetings, the attendants merely took turns reading through something from the Word and the ministry. Many became disappointed and dropped this kind of meeting. One brother told us that a certain denomination broke up into small groups, and this brother's father was assigned to be a leader of a certain group. When these ones came together in the group, however, everyone was quiet. No one would speak. Eventually, the pastor of this denomination gave up these small groups, thinking that they did not work. It is easy for everyone to attend a so-called Sunday service to listen to a pastor speak, but it is difficult to practice group meetings in which all the attendants function organically.</P><P>This shows that practicing the church life is not simply a matter of changing our way. It is a matter of changing our life. We must be persons who are really living in our spirit, walking in Christ, and living Him. Some may feel that this is too demanding, but the things of life are demanding. God can do so much for us, but He cannot eat, drink, or breathe for us. We have to exercise to eat, drink, and breathe. We must help the saints realize that they need to exercise to be brought into the enjoyment of the Lord. They have to contact Him.</P><P>The Lord is rich to all who call upon Him (Rom. 10:12). This does not mean that the Lord is rich to everyone. He is rich to that one who calls upon Him. The first thing that we should do in the morning is to enjoy Him. Then we should enjoy Him continually throughout the entire day. The Lord is real, true, and faithful. He never fails anyone who seeks after Him, who calls on Him. We must help ourselves and help the saints to contact the Lord, to call on Him. This will change our lives. This will make us powerful to touch people. When revived people come together to meet as a group, they will all have something to say. They will have a group meeting that is living, fresh, and new.</P><P>The new ones also need to be brought into the full realization of the proper church life. We must labor to bring the new ones into the larger meetings of the church and help them to know the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22b-23). Eventually, the new ones need to be led into prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P>
