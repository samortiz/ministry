   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOSPEL WORK IN THE SCHOOLS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also need to take care of the work in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The city of Taipei has about one hundred twenty thousand university students, eighty thousand technical college students, fifty thousand high school students, and one hundred forty thousand junior high school students.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This adds up to a total of almost four hundred thousand students.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The young brothers and sisters who serve full time should be assigned to preach the gospel in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not need to do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They need to do only this one thing: preach the gospel from morning to night on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is easy for one household to save three people in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But how many people can a full-timer serving on the campus save?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If every full-timer saves an average of ten people in a year, four hundred full-time brothers and sisters will be able to save four thousand people in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By doing only the campus work, we should be able to gain four thousand new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE CHILDREN S GOSPEL WORK</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another item is the children s gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should assign at least ten full-time serving ones to concentrate on the children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It would be best for most of them to be sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At present, no more than five hundred children come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We hope that we can increase this number to one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The children s meetings should be carried out in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There should not be more than twelve children in a class, and they can have three high school sisters or brothers as their teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The full-time co-workers should promote this work, prepare the teaching materials, and take care of all the other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every children s home meeting should frequently preach the gospel and invite their relatives and the children of their neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though some parents will not come, they will allow their children to come.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We believe that many people will be brought in through the children s gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope that we will have two thousand children by next spring, three thousand by the summer, and four thousand by next fall.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a great future in this work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we take this way, there will be ten thousand children in the church in Taipei within two to three years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At least two to three thousand children out of the ten thousand will not be the children of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The children s meetings will open up a way to gain people, especially the parents of the other children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE GOSPEL WORK AT ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition, we can gain people from different professions in society, such as those who work in hospitals, government offices, factories, and businesses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is very probable that we can add five to ten thousand people every year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This requires us to maintain the two great pillars of preaching the gospel from house to house and preaching the gospel in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apart from these ways to preach the gospel, we must use the small groups to recover the dormant brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are approximately ten thousand dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are faithful, within six months we will recover one-third of them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This can bring in another three thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>OPENING EVERY HOME FOR THE UNIVERSAL</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>SPREADING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must pay particular attention to opening the homes for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Opening one s home to preach the gospel must become a universal practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every saint s home must be open for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even a newly baptized saint can open his home for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The saints who have recently been baptized are fresh, and they have many friends and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they invite their friends and relatives to their homes, it will be easy to gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must change our concepts and not think that a spiritual household will be more effective in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not necessarily true.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the contrary, sometimes a household that is too spiritual does not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In general, people have children when they are young and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, our view must change.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must see that even newly saved ones can preach the gospel to gain others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, we are not saying that the saints should not be spiritual, nor are we encouraging the saints to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are saying that there is no need to be tied down by conventions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not be influenced by different situations; rather, we should just do our best to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must come to the Bible to see how the Lord Jesus preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus went to the homes of tax collectors and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He did not go merely to preach the gospel; He also sat down to eat with the tax collectors and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He said, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill Matt 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord was saying, Pharisees, if you think that you are not ill, I can have nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you feel that you are sick and that you are a sinner, come to Me. You must know that you are great sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For this reason we must change our view.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we go to the homes of the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, we should not judge the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not measure the heart or the appearance of the saints to determine whether their household is qualified to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must believe that when the gospel is preached in their home, their household will change.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The New Testament shows that the gospel was preached in the homes of sinners and in the homes of God-fearing people.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even though Zaccheus was a sinner, because he was a chief tax collector, the Lord Jesus said, Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house...Today salvation has come to this house Luke 19:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Cornelius, a God-fearing man who gave many alms to the poor and frequently prayed to God, invited Peter to his home to preach the gospel to his friends and relatives Acts 10:1-8, 24-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must go to both kinds of households.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must do whatever we can so that open homes for the gospel is a universal practice.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It does not matter whether a person is experienced; as long as he is saved, he should open his home for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are calling out to the saints, and we want every household to answer this call.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everyone, the old and the young, must preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let us put this to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we preach the gospel, we should not worry about how to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We simply need to bear the responsibility of opening our homes and inviting our relatives, neighbors, and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must also prepare some snacks; occasionally, we can even have a love feast.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, it is better to keep things simple and inexpensive.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the saints come together, they must practice speaking for the Lord by giving testimonies of how they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The gospel meetings in the homes must not be turned into worship services.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because believers in Christianity follow the customs of the nations, they cannot avoid the rituals in worship services.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, according to the record in the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus never used rituals for worship when He was in someone s home, yet people were always willing to repent and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the true worship sought by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>True worship is not prostrating oneself on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>John 4 reveals that the true worshippers of the Father are those who drink the living water vv.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>14, 23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Luke 15 records the return of the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The father saw the prodigal son from afar and ran to meet him, kissed him, and ordered the servants to put the best robe, a ring, and sandals on him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then they slaughtered the fattened calf and called everyone to eat and rejoice together vv.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>11-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When the son enjoyed what the father prepared, the father was worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the same way, the Lord does not want us to bow before Him; His delight is that we eat Him and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hence, true worship is to use our spirit to receive the Lord as life, to eat the bread of life, and to drink the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the past many Christians thought that breaking bread to remember the Lord was to meditate quietly upon all that the Lord passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I also practiced this for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I finally gained a true understanding of what the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord s Day is supposed to be when I left mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Then I wrote How to Break Bread.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When the Lord established His feast, He took the bread and blessed it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then He broke it and gave it to His disciples, saying, Take, eat; this is My body.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Then He said, Do this in remembrance of Me Matt 26:26; Luke 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>What the Lord wants us to do is to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Eating is the true remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Hence, to remember the Lord we must know that He is the bread of life and then take and eat Him in true remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Before I had this realization, I used to pay much attention to kneeling in prayer; after I had this realization, I began to pay attention to whether or not my spirit was open and exercised and to whether or not I had touched the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There should be no outward rituals in remembering the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>According to the Bible, we should return to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Everything depends on the spirit, not on letters.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In promoting the home gospel meetings, we do not want to give the saints a natural understanding or a religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We must throw these things away.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>As long as a saint has a home, that home should be open for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Everyone should give his or her testimony and speak concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We should not speak too long; we should give a short word concerning our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In this way, we will gradually produce many more saints who are able to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Preaching the gospel in the homes is a fountainhead from which we can draw much water.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>As long as we dig the well deep, the number of people who get saved in the homes will constantly increase.</S>
