In types, we see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God’s eternal economy and the divine blessing to all God’s chosen people. In history, we see that the all-inclusive Christ is the God-promised good land that all God’s chosen people should take, possess, inherit, and enjoy to the uttermost, even to the level of kingship. In poetry, we see that Christ is the unique perfection for God’s chosen people to pursue after and the unique satisfaction for God’s chosen people to obtain and enjoy. In prophecy, we see that the Triune God has become a God-man to accomplish His full redemption for the fulfillment of His eternal economy which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth.</p></ol>
