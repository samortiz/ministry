   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SON OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that while the Lord Jesus was being falsely accused, He was silent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But when He was questioned concerning His Person, whether He was the Christ, the Son of the Blessed, He answered, I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven 14:62 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although He was asked whether He was the Son of the Blessed, that is, the Son of God, the Lord referred to Himself as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord is the Son of Man, not only on earth before His crucifixion, but also in the heavens on the right hand of God after His resurrection Acts 7:56 , and even at His coming back on the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To accomplish God s purpose the Lord had to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without man, God s purpose could not be carried out on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 14:62 the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to the Jewish leaders, You ask Me whether I am the Christ, the Son of the Blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I say, Yes, I am.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am also the Son of Man, and you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of Power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You speak of the Blessed, but I speak of Power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both Blessed in verse 61 and Power in verse 62 refer to the almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s use of the word Power indicates that the Jewish leaders were not the government, but that He is the government.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord went on to indicate to them that He would come back as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord also seemed to be saying, You revere God as the Blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But I tell you, He is the Power to govern all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Pilate was examining the Lord Jesus, he did not care whether or not He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, Pilate questioned Him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To this question the Lord answered, You are saying it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that the Lord admitted to Pilate that He was the King of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, He was both the Son of God and the King of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of this, He was sentenced to death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that He was crucified as the Son of God and as the King of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PASSING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In chapter fourteen, while the Lord Jesus was passing through the judgment at the hands of men, Peter failed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In his failure he passed through the experience of the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the close followers of the Lord were also brought into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not think that the Lord Jesus was finished with Peter because of his failure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No, Peter s failure was his crucifixion, and this crucifixion was the entrance into the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter needed to be crucified, to be brought into the death of Christ, because he was so natural.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being bold, he always took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Certainly it is necessary for such a person to be crossed out, and Peter was in fact crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although he did not realize it at the time, he entered into the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No doubt, later, after the Lord s resurrection and ascension, Peter came to realize that he had entered into the Lord s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For years I did not understand why the record concerning the judgment of the Lord Jesus is merged with the account of Peter s experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I thought that this was merely intended to be an exposure of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now I see that not only was Peter being exposed, but He was passing through the process of death with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because Peter is our representative, this means that we all entered into the Lord s death with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus went through death in a triumphant way, but Peter went through death in the way of failure.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This failure exposed Peter s natural being and caused it to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus was not the only one who passed through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All of us, represented by Peter, have passed through this process with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you not think that you are a Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all are Peters needing to be exposed, judged, and crucified.</S>
