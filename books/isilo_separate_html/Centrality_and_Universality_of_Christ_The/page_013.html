After you read through the entire book from chapter one through chapter twenty-one, where did this Christ go? You may say that Christ went to heaven after His resurrection. However, according to the Gospel of John, Christ is still here. In Mark and Luke, we are told that Christ went to the heavens after He was resurrected. But the Gospel of John, the Gospel of Christ being life to us, does not say that the very Christ who is life in us has gone to the heavens. So where is He? Praise the Lord that today He is not only among us but also and even more He is in us. He is the subjective Christ in us. If He is not subjective, if He is merely a Savior in the heavens and He is not in us, how can He be life to us? He can never be life to us unless He is in us. We must know and realize Him as One who is more subjective than objective to us.</P><P>John 15:4-5 says, "Abide in Me and I in you....I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him...." These verses clearly show that Christ is subjective to us. Let us also read Romans 8:9-10: "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. But if Christ is in you...." "Christ is in you"&#151;this is the key phrase in the book of Romans.</P><P>Now we come to the book of Galatians. In 1:15-16 Paul said, "It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me." Then in 2:20 he said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." So we see that Christ is revealed in us and then lives in us. Furthermore, in 4:19 Paul said, "My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you." To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ mingled with our whole being. In every part of our being&#151;in our mind, in our emotion, in our will, in our conscience, and in our spirit&#151;Christ is mingled with us. This means Christ is formed in us. It is not only Christ revealed in us and living in us but also Christ being formed in us. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ fully grown in us. Christ has to saturate us and permeate us until He is altogether blended with us. Then He is formed in us. How subjective He is to us!</P><P>Colossians 1:27 says, "To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." This mystery of God is not just the Christ in the heavens but even more the Christ in us as our hope of glory. Furthermore, Colossians 3:4 tells us that Christ is our life. Christ is our life today and He is our hope in the future. He is everything to us. However, the most important thing is that He is in us.</P><P>In addition to the verses mentioned above, we have Ephesians 3:17: "That Christ may make His home in your hearts...." The Greek word for make home is the verb form of the noun home. Christ not only dwells in us but also makes His home in us. To dwell, to remain, in a certain place is one thing, and to make home, to settle down, in that place is another thing. I have been a guest in the saints' homes many times in the past years in the Lord's work, but I have never once settled down in any of the saints' homes. I cannot do this, because that is not my home. I do not have the liberty and the right to settle down in their home. However, Christ not only is in us, lives in us, dwells in us, and is being formed in us, but also wants to make His home in us, to settle down in us. Many Christians are longing to go to heaven as their home, but Christ is longing to come to them as His home. You may want to go there, but He wants to come here. You are going in the wrong direction. You want to go, but He wants to come. You want to have heaven, but He wants to have you.</P><P>I know you all have Christ within you, but do you have Him living in you and being formed in you? Even the more, do you have Him making His home, settling down, in you? This is very subjective. Only such a subjective Christ can be everything to us. If He is only objective, He might be able to be our Savior, our Deliverer, and our Help, but He cannot be the life and the subjective inner strength to us. But praise the Lord that He is now within us, so He is everything to us. This is just like saying that the electricity in this room is everything to this room. If we need heat, it gives us heat. If we need cooling, it gives us cooling. If we need light, it gives us light. If we need power, it gives us power. There is one electricity yet it is all-inclusive. However, it must be in the room. If it is only in the power plant and not in the room, it has nothing to do with us.</P><P>Let us learn how to realize Christ as the subjective One. He is the center and He is everything, yet He must be subjective to us. No matter how much He is, how good He is, and how all-inclusive He is, if He is not subjective, He is nothing to us. The objective Christ who is far away from us has nothing to do with us. But, praise Him, today He is in us. I can testify that every day I am dealing with this subjective Christ.</P><P>Christ must be subjective more than objective to us. Then there is the availability for us to experience Him and enjoy Him. Today He is not only with us and close to us, but He is also within us. I would say that He is so "handy" within us. We have to experience Him as such a handy and subjective Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
