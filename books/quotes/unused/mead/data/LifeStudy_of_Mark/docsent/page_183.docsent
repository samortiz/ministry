   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO CASES OF BLINDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Gospel of Mark we have two cases of particular healings of blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first case is that of the healing of the blind man in Bethsaida 8:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the Lord spit in the blind man s eyes and laid His hands on him, He asked him, Do you see anything? v. 23 . The man replied, I behold men; I see them as trees walking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the Lord laid His hands upon his eyes, and the man looked intently and was restored, and he saw all things clearly v. 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Immediately after the healing of the blind man in Bethsaida, the Lord Jesus went with His disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>8:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They answered, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, one of the prophets v. 28 . Then the Lord questioned the disciples further: But you, who do you say that I am? v. 29 . This question indicates that the Lord was healing His disciples seeing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second case of the healing of blindness recorded in Mark is the case of blind Bartimaeus 10:46-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is significant that this case comes immediately after the Lord s dealing with the request of James and John to sit at His right and left in His glory 10:35-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that they could make such a request proves that they were blind and in need of the Lord s specific healing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The disciples needed the healing of their seeing, hearing, and speaking organs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>CHRIST REPLACING THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Beginning in chapter eight, the Lord Jesus began to help the disciples to see His Person, His all-inclusive death, and His marvelous resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Three times He spoke to them concerning His death and resurrection 8:31; 9:30-32; 10:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the Mount of Transfiguration the Lord Jesus gave a demonstration to Peter, James, and John concerning who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was transformed before them; and His garments became brilliant, exceedingly white, such as no fuller on earth could whiten them 9:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the mountain there appeared to them Elijah together with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus v. 4 . Not knowing what to say, Peter took the lead to say to the Lord Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And let us make three tabernacles one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah v. 5 . What Peter spoke was according to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not realize that the Old Testament things had been buried with the Lord Jesus in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the human point of view, there was nothing wrong with Peter s suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moses and Elijah were both great men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moses represented the law, and Elijah represented the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, from the point of view of God s New Testament economy, Peter spoke in a nonsensical way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mark 9:7 says, And a cloud came overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is My Son, the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hear Him!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This word is our basis for saying that Christ is the entire, universal replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This One should replace Moses and Elijah; that is, He should replace the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He should replace the old things, which were terminated and buried in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Chapter nine of the Gospel of Mark indicates that Christ is the universal replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>CHOSEN IN CHRIST AND BAPTIZED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus gathered the disciples to be the soil in which He sowed the Triune God as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord healed the disciples organs of seeing, hearing, and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then He brought this soil with Him when He was examined, judged, and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He brought it with Him through His all-inclusive death and into His wonderful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to consider the Gospel of Mark from the point of view of the Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to Ephesians 1:4, God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that in eternity past God put us into Christ, for He chose us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fact of His choosing us in Christ indicates that He had already put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we were put into Christ before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to our experience, we may say that we were put into Christ when we believed into Him and were baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This understanding is correct, and it is according to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are told in the New Testament that we are baptized into Christ Gal 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a word concerning being in Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ephesians 1:4, however, is a word concerning God s selection of us in eternity, a word that indicates that before the foundation of the world God had already put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to view Mark 1 in the light of Ephesians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In chapter one of Mark the Christ into whom we were put by God in eternity past came to be baptized by John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since we had been put into Him before the foundation of the world, Christ did not come alone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, He came with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, when He was baptized, we were baptized in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you believe that you were put into Christ by God the Father before the foundation of the world and that you were in Christ when He was baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you see this, you will praise the Lord and say, Hallelujah, when the Lord Jesus was baptized in Mark 1, I was baptized too!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was in Him when He was baptized in the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have the view presented in Paul s Epistles, we shall realize that we were baptized in the Jordan with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all need to see this.</S>
