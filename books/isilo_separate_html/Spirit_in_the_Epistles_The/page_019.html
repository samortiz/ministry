The problem of the Galatians is the problem of every Christian. According to our natural concept, we the saved ones all have a desire to do good. In other words, we like to keep the law. Immediately after we are saved, we have a concept within us, thinking that before we believed in the Lord, we had a bad temper and our conduct was poor; now that we are saved, we ought to improve our conduct and behave properly. The strange thing is that every Christian has this concept also whenever he is revived. He has the feeling that formerly he was a careless and indifferent Christian, but now since he has been revived through the Lord&#8217;s mercy, he should behave properly and not be so loose.<p>Brothers and sisters, is this concept right or wrong? Humanly speaking, it is a very good concept; from God&#8217;s viewpoint, however, it is wrong. This kind of doing good is equivalent to the Jews&#8217; keeping of the law. It is the flesh that keeps the law and works out the law. Whenever man desires to do good, he uses his own strength. Sometimes you know that you are weak, so you pray to the Lord for help. However, the Lord will never answer this kind of prayer. Truthfully speaking, the more you wish to do good, the more the Lord wishes that you would not do good. You think that it would be good if you could succeed, but the Lord considers that it would be good if you fail. For example, you may have a bad temper, so you pray to the Lord, asking Him to help you to be patient. However, the more you pray in this way, the less patience you have. Your temper worsens, even to such an extent that you are altogether disappointed with yourself. You say, &#8220;Lord, I have no way anymore!&#8221; When such a day comes, the Lord would say, &#8220;This is wonderful!&#8221; Why? Because His intention is not for us to do good.<p>Brothers and sisters, God has no intention for us to do good. Rather, God wants us to live out Christ. God&#8217;s goal is not the law but Christ. Galatians chapter one says it pleased God to reveal His Son in us. Chapter two says it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. It is not we who are doing good, but it is Christ who lives in us.<p>Man was created in the image of God, and the image of God is Christ. Second Corinthians 4:4 says that Christ is the image of God. Colossians 1:15 also says that the beloved Son is the image of God. Why did God create man according to Christ? He did this in order that one day He might put Christ in man. Man is a vessel to contain Christ. A glove is made according to the shape of the hand, and it is also made to contain the hand. If I want to put my hand into the glove, but the glove is uncooperative and does not give me the room, my hand cannot be comfortable inside the glove. All the fingers of my hand must fit into the glove; only then can my hand feel comfortable. At that moment the glove is altogether the same as the shape of the hand. We may say that the hand has been formed in the glove.<p>After we have been saved, the Lord Jesus is in us. However, He is very frustrated in us, and sometimes He is imprisoned in our spirit. We may not give Him any ground in our soul, including our mind, emotion, and will. Finally one day, as we are moved by His love, we gradually open ourselves to Him and give Him more ground. Then He is able to spread outward. At a certain time we may have an argument with the Lord again, and we are not willing to give Him more ground; then He has to stop there and wait patiently. Sometimes He may be gracious to us and may draw us with His love, yet it is still to no avail. Then He may be forced to lift His hand to give us a little blow. In any case, if you would not be subdued by Him this year, two years later He will subdue you. If you would not be subdued by Him in this life, He will subdue you when He comes back. Since He is in us, in spite of everything He must be formed in us.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
