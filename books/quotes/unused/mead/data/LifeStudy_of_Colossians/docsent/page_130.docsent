   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Galatians 3:27 Paul says, For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Christ in Galatians 3:27 is equal to the Father, Son, and Spirit in Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many years ago a certain person tried to argue with me about baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acknowledging that we respected the Bible and baptized people in water, he asked me in what name we baptize the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Was it in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, in the name of Christ Jesus, or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He went on to say that the name makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I asked him to explain the difference between Christ in Galatians 3:27 and the Father, Son, and Spirit in Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He replied that Christ is merely the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then I went on to say that instead of arguing, we should simply enjoy the Father, Son, and Spirit, Christ Jesus, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I said that Christ is all-inclusive, that He is not only the Son, but also the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I also told him that we may baptize one person into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit; another, into Christ; and still another, into the Lord Jesus Christ or into Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is nothing wrong with baptizing people in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we compare Matthew 28:19 with Galatians 3:27, we see that to baptize people into Christ is to baptize them into the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not care to argue over terminology; we care only for the living Person, for the all-inclusive, life-imparting, processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Romans 6:3 Paul asks, Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Have you ever wondered why Paul says that those who are baptized into Christ Jesus are baptized into His death?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have been baptized into a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How then can we be baptized into His death?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why are we not baptized into His resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I had been the author of Romans 6:3, I would have said that those who are baptized into Christ are baptized into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you had a choice, would you not prefer to be baptized into resurrection instead of into death?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But Paul says definitely that those who have been baptized into Christ have been baptized into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The resurrected Christ still bears in Himself the effectiveness of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise we could not be baptized into His death by being baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fact that we are baptized into Christ and into His death indicates that Christ and His death are one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Drinking tea can be used as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we drink tea, we drink both tea and water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the water and the tea are one, the water carries the element, the reality, of the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In like manner, the resurrection of Christ carries the element of His effective death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, when a person is baptized into Christ, he is spontaneously baptized into the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is impossible to separate Christ s death from Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The being of the resurrected Christ includes the element of His effective death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The effectiveness of Christ s death is one of the ingredients of His all-inclusive being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a tremendous difference between death in Adam and the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I loathe death in Adam, but I appreciate the sweetness of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His death is dear and lovable, and I long to abide restfully in it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How wonderful that a believer baptized into the all-inclusive Christ is also placed into the death of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the words of a hymn written by A. B. Simpson, Oh! it is so sweet to die with Christ! Rest and victory are found in Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE HEAVENLY AIR</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that to be baptized is to be placed into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How is it possible for Christ to be the spiritual water in which we are immersed?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ can be such water because in resurrection He was processed to become the pneuma, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the pneuma, Christ is the heavenly air.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To baptize someone into such air is much easier than to baptize him into water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everybody knows that water comes from rain and that rain comes from moisture in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ today is the spiritual air full of moisture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we baptize people into Christ, we baptize them into Him as the heavenly pneuma, into the all-inclusive, life-giving, processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The way to get into Christ is to be baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All believers should have the assurance that they have been baptized into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can boldly testify that because we have been baptized into Christ and into His death, we are now in Christ.</S>
