   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY-ONE FAITH BUT NOT DOCTRINE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:13-14; Jude 3; 1 Tim 1:19; 3:9; 6:12a; 2 Tim 4:7; Titus 1:4, 13b</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 4:13 Paul speaks of the oneness of the faith, and in 4:14 he refers to the winds of teaching, of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that we need to distinguish between the faith and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regarding the faith what we must believe in order to be saved the New Testament is strong, strict, and consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Jude 3 we are even told that we should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning the faith, we must be ready to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not merely insist on the faith and stand for it, but fight for it at any cost, even at the cost of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The faith for which we must fight is the common faith, the Christian faith, the faith that saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>LIBERAL WITH OTHERS REGARDING DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In contrast, in the New Testament we are never charged to fight for doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As far as doctrine is concerned, the New Testament is liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Take the example of eating what has been sacrificed to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you read what Paul says about this in Romans and in 1 Corinthians, you may be puzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In some places Paul indicates that it is permissible to eat what has been offered to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, in other places he strongly advises against this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Years ago, I spent a great deal of time trying to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Troubled by what seemed to be an inconsistency in Paul s writings, I wondered why he did not tell us in a straightforward way whether or not we should eat things that have been sacrificed to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only after I had been delivered from preoccupation with doctrine did I come to understand that Paul wrote different things on different occasions about eating because he was liberal with respect to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He knew that under certain circumstances it was permissible to eat, whereas in other circumstances it was not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only when you have been delivered from preoccupation with doctrine will you be able to understand that certain matters pertaining to doctrine are relative to the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why Paul could say one thing on one occasion and something else on a different occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FOUR NEGATIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning the eating of meat or the observing of certain days, Paul did not take a definite stand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, in these matters he was liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in Romans 16:17 he said strongly, Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As far as doctrines go, Paul was liberal, but as far as divisiveness was concerned, he was definite.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He told us to mark out those who cause division and to avoid them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1 Corinthians 5:7-11 Paul deals with fornication and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 9 he charges the saints not to company with fornicators.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Fornication damages humanity, and idolatry is an insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although Paul was liberal with respect to doctrine, he would not tolerate anything related to fornication or idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His word about these things is strong and definite.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Titus 3:10 Paul says, A man that is factious, after the first and second admonition, reject Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>. A factious person is divisive and sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After such a one has been admonished once or twice, he should be rejected if he continues in his divisiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There can be no compromise or neutrality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, regarding idolatry, fornication, and divisiveness Paul was very strict, and we must be strict also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Second Epistle of John, we see that we must also reject those who deny the incarnation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 7 says, For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This verse indicates that even in the first century there were certain ones who called themselves Christians, but who did not confess that Christ was God come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words they denied the fact that Christ was God incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 9 the writer goes on to say, Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word transgress here means to go a little farther.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible reveals that Christ is God incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who denied this went too far; they had given up the teaching that Christ is God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the Apostle John warned the believers concerning this kind of person: If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God-speed: for he that biddeth him God-speed is partaker of his evil deeds vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot receive those who do deny the incarnation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the New Testament, there are four things which we cannot tolerate: idolatry, fornication, division, and the denial of the deity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Concerning the faith, we must be bold, strong, and definite, ready to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, as far as doctrines are concerned, we must be liberal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nevertheless, we cannot tolerate idolatry, fornication, division, and the denial of the incarnation of Christ.</S>
