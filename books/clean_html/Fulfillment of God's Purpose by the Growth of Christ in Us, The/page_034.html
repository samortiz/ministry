<P>Now let us consider Colossians 3. Verse 18 tells the wives to be subject to their husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Verse 16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God." The Spirit within us is the divine power, and the Word outside of us is the great and precious promises. We have to be filled with the Spirit and with the Word. The Spirit is in Ephesians 5 and the Word is in Colossians 3.</P><P>We need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly by pray-reading the Word. When we pray-read the Word, it becomes the Spirit. In John 6:63 the Lord said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." If we call on the name of the Lord and pray and read His Word, His Word will become the Spirit. Then we will be rejoicing in the Lord because we are full of Christ. Spontaneously, we will have the sweet submission.</P><P>The submission comes out of the seed that has been sown into us. The divine power has given us all the things pertaining to life and godliness. This power is the Spirit within us. We also have been given the great and precious promises in the Word outside of us. We should not keep away from the Spirit within and the Word without. We have to continually contact the Spirit within and pray-read the Word without. We do not merely study the Word as a book. We pray-read the Word by calling upon the name of the Lord. We have the Spirit within as the divine power and the holy book without as the great and precious promises. All the riches of the divine life are our portion for us to enjoy. When we enjoy these riches, we will have the expression of life, godliness, in our living. Our living will be one of godliness, the expression of God as life.</P><P>Whatever we need will be supplied to us. Submission, patience, humility, love, power, and mercy are all in the divine seed within us. The Body life, the local church life, is included in this godliness. The local church life has been given to us. Perhaps we have seen the New Testament church, so we agree to come together and practice it. But if we do this without the enjoyment of Christ, our practice will be a mess. We need to call on the name of the Lord, be filled within, and enjoy His Word. This is to render Him the adequate cooperation. Then we will enjoy the current of the heavenly electricity flooding us with the riches of life. Spontaneously, we will have the proper church life. The church life comes out of the divine seed within us. It is not something made up by us. The church life is a great item of godliness. We have the church life within already. What we need now is to develop it. The fruit is included in the seed, and the seed has been given to us. If we develop the seed, we will develop the fruit.</P><P>In Ephesians 5 there is the Spirit, and in Colossians 3 there is the Word. Eventually, the Word and the Spirit are one. By comparing these two matching portions of the Scripture, we can see that the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. We can make the Word the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading. Then the Spirit will be consolidated with the Word. We need to be filled in our spirit and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. God has given, and God has done everything. Now we need to take the initiative to be filled. If we open the window, the air will come in. We have the Spirit and the Word as the key to being filled. Now we need to exercise our spirit to be filled with the Spirit by letting the word dwell in us richly through calling on the Lord and pray-reading the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR A FRESH CONSECRATION</H2><P>We need to consecrate ourselves anew to the Lord for the working of the inner life. We should pray, "Lord, You have given everything to me, and I have received everything of You. Now I want to give You the cooperation. Lord, I am willing. I put myself into Your hands." We need a renewed consecration for the development of life within us.</P>
