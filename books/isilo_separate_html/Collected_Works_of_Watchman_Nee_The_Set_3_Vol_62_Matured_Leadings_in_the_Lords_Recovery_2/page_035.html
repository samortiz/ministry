We left them because we felt that our need for serving the Lord was not met. God wants the whole church to rise up to serve Him. God has put such a desire within every brother and sister. Therefore, the responsible brothers in the church must pay attention to this matter. If we frustrate and stop the brothers and sisters from serving, we are offending the Holy Spirit. This is a very serious thing. This is true not only for the testimony of the Body in one locality but also for the testimony of the Body in the universal church. If the entire church in Hong Kong does not rise up to serve now, one day the tide of universal service will sweep to Hong Kong. You will be forced to take the way of universal service. What is the preaching of the gospel? What is edification and visitation? It is the actual carrying out of the universal service of the whole church.</p><p>A church must arrive at Ephesians 4. It must not only have the first kind of service&mdash;that of the gifts&mdash;but the second kind of service as well&mdash;that of the functioning of all the members. If there is only the first kind of service, the building of the Body is not complete. The first kind of service through the gifts is the initiation. The second kind of service through all the members is the universal service of the entire church. If every member in the church rises up to serve, there will be a very sweet testimony of oneness in the church.</p><p>Please forgive me for mentioning something related to myself. My son is about twenty years old. One day he asked me, "Why are you so busy? Other preachers and pastors are very free. Why are you so busy, not only in the church, but at home as well?" I answered by telling him about the demand of the life within us. I have to shout at the top of my voice today: I wish I could have twenty lives to go to all the churches to coordinate and serve with all the brothers and sisters. Within me I feel that this is the sweetest employment on earth.</p><p>Let me ask Brother Hsia: "Would you like to be a king today?" I believe we would consider this a most glorious calling. If we are given the chance to be a king on earth, we would feel very honored and privileged. But today we are called to serve our God! Once we touch the service of the church, we touch heaven, and we have the presence of God. We must allow that serving spirit to come out of us. We must allow the serving life within us to have an outlet, to break through our own limitations, and to serve freely. The church service is a service in which Christ flows out of our being. Once God moves in the church, there is service. Once we see God working in the brothers and sisters and in the church, we have to be prepared; the universal service is just around the corner. When the Holy Spirit operates within the saints, their service will be like the moving of mighty winds and billowing waves; nothing will stop it. Therefore, if we ignore the Body coordination and service in the church, we bear a great responsibility. The greater the coordination, the more manifestation of the Body testimony there will be. The deeper and more thorough this coordination develops, the more God's glory will be expressed. We have to pay attention to all the responsibilities that the brothers and sisters are able to bear, whether they are great or small. We have to follow them up, give them a free hand to serve, watch over them, and help them to serve. We should never frustrate them, stop them, or replace them. If we are faithful to practice this, God will have a way. Otherwise, I am afraid we will be a hindrance to hundreds of souls in their salvation. If we go along with God's flow, it will be very easy for men to be saved. We must not only urge and remind the brothers and sisters to go on, but we must learn to usher them into the service. Personally, I feel that if the heart to serve in all the brothers and sisters is stirred up and if the whole church rises up to serve, it will not be hard to gain a thousand souls by the end of this year. We can neglect many things, but we can never offend the serving spirit of the saints. If my words are too strong, please forgive me.</p><p>Let me give another testimony. On April 15, 1942, I went to Tsingtao from Chefoo for some meetings. At that time I asked how many brothers and sisters were in fellowship with us there. Seventy to eighty were in attendance. I then asked how many saints were in the entire church. I was told that there were a little over one hundred thirty. We met that day until the evening. All the co-workers and responsible brothers and sisters were brought into one accord. No one had any resistance in his spirit concerning the service of the church. At that time we had not baptized a single person. But by June 15, two hundred people were baptized in Tsingtao alone. By the end of the year, the number increased to six hundred. In 1943 the number increased to over a thousand. Because of the invasion of the Japanese, the meetings were stopped, and saints began to meet in the homes. By 1950 there were over three thousand saints in Tsingtao. Later, the brothers and sisters from Tsinan visited Tsingtao. They saw the situation. There was resistance among them because they did not have the same spirit of one accord, and the spirit of service could not get through in Tsinan. Even now the number in Tsinan is still under five hundred. The brothers and sisters from Tsinan did not express any opposition outwardly, but they did not agree with the practice in Tsingtao in reality. For this reason, the church did not get the blessing. We cannot offend the Holy Spirit. In order for the service to grow and expand, we must never offend the serving spirit in the church. If we offend the serving spirit in the church, we offend the Body of Christ. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT OFFENDING THE CHRIST WITHIN THE CHURCH</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Time is almost up. I will only say a few short words. The offenses God's children commit against the Christ in them are much less than the offenses they commit against the Christ in the church. It is easy for a Christian to be recovered if he offends the Christ within him, but it is not as easy to be recovered if he offends the Christ in the church. I say this because these two things are basically different. If we offend the Christ within us, we have not touched God's plan in this age. This is the reason it is easy to be recovered. But if a man offends the Christ in the church, he has offended God's plan of administration in that age. This is a serious thing. The damage is great. It may frustrate the salvation of many souls. Let me say this to the responsible brothers and especially to the elders: We can never offend the Christ in the church.</p><p>If we offend the Christ in the church, on the one hand, we close the door to God's gospel. On the other hand, we frustrate those whom God may possibly use in a great way. We block the gospel and annul the gifts in the church. Therefore, we must never offend the Christ in the church. This is a very serious matter. We must have a godly fear and understand that it is a grave matter to block Christ's way within the church.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Brother Bau: Lord, be particularly merciful to us. Every one of us has Your life, and every one of us has a desire to serve. Without service, there is no manifestation of the life of Christ in the church. Lord, draw us so that we will consecrate ourselves to You once again. We want You to have a clear way in the church through our service. Lord, may You express Your glory through the church, and may You work through the church. Be gracious to us. May none of us be a hindrance to You. Be merciful to the church in Hong Kong. Be merciful to us. We admit that we are useless servants. We are prepared to go on with Your present flow today. Lord, may You gain the full glory.</p><p>Watchman Nee: Lord, we give ourselves to You. Grant us no peace within when our spirit is dull. Whenever we are wrong, may we sense death. May our mind, spirit, emotion, and will be completely open to You. May You gain a free way within us. Amen.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
