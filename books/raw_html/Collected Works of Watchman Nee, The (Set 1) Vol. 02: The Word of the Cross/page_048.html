<P>Some men with equal or higher intelligence than these critics have pointed out the unreliability of their arguments. Modern scholarship has gradually overturned the authority of higher criticism. Many of the higher critics are unable to answer the challenges of books written by their opponents. A recently published book Is Higher Criticism Reasonable? was written by Dr. Wilson who came to China two years ago (1923). The higher critics have not been able to answer the challenges made in his book. The knowledge of one critic or the knowledge of all the critics combined are not enough to overturn the authenticity of the Bible! Dr. Wilson said, "We now acknowledge that the authenticity of the Old Testament cannot be overturned by any human knowledge that has been thus far acquired."</P><P>The higher critics are only a disguised form of the devil who said, "Yea, hath God said?" (Gen. 3:1) All the facts of archeology disprove the theories of these critics. Dr. A. H. Sayce, a famous archaeologist once said, </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Archaeological finds based on scientific methods have removed the suppositions and judgments of the dogmatic critics. Without exaggeration, the discoveries of the archaeologists during the last thirty years have, with no exception, overturned the most trusted judgments of the literary critics, and they have also confirmed the reliability of our record, the Bible. The early use of the written language in the Near East for literature, the high standard of education at the time of Abraham and Moses, and the fine and detailed record of the Bible, have all been proven.</P><P>If the Bible is a book fabricated by men, all the mistakes made by the copiers of the manuscripts should have been eliminated. There is no need to wait for the critics to find them out. If the Bible is not inspired by God, on what can we base our faith? Without the Bible as the basis of our faith, there is no ground to believe in the divine teaching as revealed in the Bible. The higher critics are purely materialistic because they have assigned all supernatural things to the category of the unbelievable.</P><P>The history of the higher critics proves that they are the very ones that the Lord Jesus referred to in one of His stories: "If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead" (Luke 16:31). The critics try to prove their own theories by quoting the Pentateuch. Then they begin to question the word of the prophets, suspecting that Isaiah was not written by one man, that Daniel was not written by Daniel, and that the story of Jonah is just an allegory. Finally, they doubt the words of the Gospels. They have not heard the words of Moses and the prophets, and they are not persuaded by Christ who rose from the dead!</P><P>The critics say that they consider the writers of the Bible to be great human philosophers. Actually, they consider the writers to be the greatest liars and hypocrites! All the writers of the Bible have claimed that they were divinely inspired. If they were not inspired, as the critics claim, would not their lofty moral and spiritual standards condemn them to the deepest hell? Therefore, the Bible must either be God's Word or the devil's word. Does the devil disguise himself as an angel of light and teach others to worship God, hate the devil, know about regeneration, justification, and sanctification? Does the devil preach these words?</P><P>The critics think that they are Christians and God's servants. Yet according to their philosophy, there is no revelation and no gospel. Does this not make the Bible a strange fairy tale? Is this what a Christian and a servant of God preaches?</P><P>Since this is a present condition, we should "contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints" (Jude 3). Concerning those who are in doubt, we should "have mercy" on them (Jude 23), and should correct them in meekness, "if perhaps God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth" (2 Tim. 2:25). Concerning unbelieving preachers, the Scripture has a clear teaching concerning how to deal with them: "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!" (2 John 10). The danger facing the church today is that the truth is sacrificed in the effort to unite the different denominations. We believe in the fundamental truths and have no fellowship with those who believe in modern theology and higher criticism. The time has come for the Levites to be separated from the other twelve tribes. The time has come for preachers in China and Christians to rise up for God and declare their faith.</P><P>It hurts my heart the most to see that so many leaders in the church are unclear about their faith. They think that modern theology and traditional theology are the same. They do not realize that they either belong to the modern camp or the traditional camp and that there is no middle ground between the two camps. It is, of course, bad to divide the church into denominations, but it is better for the denominations to remain than to sacrifice the truth for ecumenicity! The Lord Jesus is now being rejected by the ones who call themselves Christians and servants of God. Who is willing to stand with the Lord Jesus and be rejected? We would rather write books that no one reads than to oppose God's truth in an attempt to please the religious, social mentality. We would rather publish magazines that no one reads than to publish magazines that are an offense in God's eyes, which have thousands of subscribers. We would rather speak sermons that no one hears than to whitewash sinners, only to see them becoming sons of hell! "Whoever...does not doubt in his heart, but believes" (Mark 11:23). "Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed" (John 20:29).</P>
