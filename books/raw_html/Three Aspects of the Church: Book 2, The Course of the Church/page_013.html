	 <h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT&rsquo;S WAY OF<br />
BREAKING THROUGH THE PROBLEMS</h2>
<p>After Paul returned to Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit came in to discipline him. On the seventh day, just as Paul was about to complete his vow, some Jews came to the temple and seized him (Acts 21:26-27). Not long after this incident&mdash;perhaps ten years later&mdash;the Roman prince Titus led an army to destroy the temple. It has not been rebuilt to this day. If Titus had not destroyed the temple, the church would have been mixed with the Jewish religion. Thank God that He did not allow His children to go back to the Old Testament, nor did He allow the church to be mixed with Judaism. He completely destroyed the influence of the Jewish religion in the church.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul returned to Jerusalem to accommodate the Jews, but instead he was imprisoned. Jerusalem, which promoted returning to Judaism, was thoroughly torn down. From the time of its destruction, the Bible does not record anything concerning Jerusalem, nor is it given much position in church history. In God&rsquo;s eyes Jerusalem was a place that damaged grace and covered up the light; therefore, both the city and its temple had to be torn down in order to break through the problems and obstacles.</p>
<p>After his weakness in accommodating Judaism led to his arrest, Paul had to use his wisdom in his interrogation by the Sanhedrin. First, he discussed the matter of resurrection before the Pharisees and the Sadducees (23:6-8). Paul set the Pharisees against the Saducees by saying to them loudly, &ldquo;Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!&rdquo; (v. 6). The orthodox Jews immediately took Paul&rsquo;s side, and began to argue with the Sadducees, who did not believe that there is a resurrection. This was Paul&rsquo;s wisdom. Next he appealed to Caesar (25:11). Paul&rsquo;s original feeling was that he needed to go to Rome. The Holy Spirit confirmed this by revealing to him that he would testify for the Lord in Rome (23:11). Ultimately, Paul did go to Rome, but not in a way of convenience. He could have gone to Rome in freedom; now he came in a different way. He even might have done more while in Rome, but from this time onward, Paul&rsquo;s movements were greatly restricted.</p>
<p>In spite of the inconvenience of his imprisonment, Paul learned a deep lesson and wrote many precious Epistles while in prison. We cannot deny this. Nonetheless, Paul&rsquo;s return to Jerusalem was a hindrance to the spread of the church. It is always a problem and a frustration when we go in circles rather than a straight line. Paul should have gone straight to Rome from Corinth, but the elements of oldness within him and his attachments to the ordinances became an entanglement to him, causing him to go backward to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Between Paul&rsquo;s trip to Jerusalem in Acts 15 and his trip in Acts 21, he wrote the book of Galatians. In Galatians he had depreciated the Jewish law to the uttermost. Although he had said that he could be all things to all men (1 Cor. 9:20-22), in Acts 21 he was too much in his accommodation of Jewish traditions. In reality, one cannot be all things to all people; if someone worships idols and we follow him in his idol worship, we have gone too far. It is absolutely wrong to do such a thing. When Paul taught the Gentile churches, he explained the revelation he had received very clearly&mdash;the law is over, so we need not tolerate Jewish things. In order to be a Jew to the Jews, he could have done a few things, and it would have been enough. He did not need to make a vow or offer sacrifices. His practice in this case was against his revelation and against the teachings he had given to the churches; what he did was too much.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother goes for a walk with his friend, and when they reach the door of a movie theater his friend wants to go in and see a movie. The brother should tell his friend that he cannot go in with him and let him go in alone. When some friends are playing mah-jongg, we cannot sit with them. We cannot be all things to all people. Paul was weak when he was in Jerusalem because he was not in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit was not with him. We cannot be strong in ourselves. When we follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, we have His presence and can spontaneously be strong. But without His presence, we are all weak.</p>
<p>Although the Holy Spirit disciplined Paul, God still sent him to Rome. Because Paul was always in the hand of the Lord, the Holy Spirit could use His disciplining hand to send him to Rome. When Paul arrived in Rome, he was limited in many ways according to God&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p>
<p>Acts chapters 16 through 28 all speak of the church&rsquo;s spreading in Europe. The biggest and most frustrating problem in this section is the Jewish religion. In the beginning the problem was Judaism, and at the end this problem was still there. The problem of Judaism was considered at the conference in Jerusalem in Acts 15, but it was not completely resolved. Only when God stretched out His hand to destroy the temple in Jerusalem was this problem solved. Once the problem of Judaism was cleared up, the church was set free. The church was like a chick coming out of the eggshell of Judaism. When God stretched forth His hand to destroy Jerusalem and the temple, the eggshell was completely cast aside. From then on, the church could spread in freedom.</p>
<p>According to Acts 21, the church in Jerusalem was steeped in Judaism. The brothers in Jerusalem told Paul that there were tens of thousands of believers, all zealous for the law (v. 20). The fact that many among them still made vows shows that they were zealous both for the spirit of the law and the ordinances of the law (v. 23). They even went to the temple to worship God and to ask the Jewish priests to offer sacrifices for them (v. 26). This shows that there was no separation between the believers in Jerusalem and Judaism; they had returned to the Jewish religion. Not only did they practice elements of Judaism, they also exhorted Paul to do the same. They even made these elements into a doctrine with which they taught Paul. When the brothers exhorted Paul, they did it before James and all the elders (v. 18). Yet no one stood up to protest. All the elders gave their silent approval to this matter.</p>
<p>Clearly, the church in Jerusalem had fallen into Judaism. The earthly Jerusalem is not trustworthy; only the heavenly Jerusalem can be trusted. Thus, from this time onward the Bible does not mention the church in Jerusalem. Even in church history, Jerusalem has no position. This shows that deadened Judaism and old human concepts are great frustrations to the spread of the church.</p>
<p>The old creation and the old ordinances within us hinder the spread of the church. Outward persecution and troubles cannot stop the church&rsquo;s spread; instead, they help. However, old relationships, ordinances, methods, and even truths become entanglements to servants of the Lord and hinder the spread of the church. Even though we have a sense within and a burden, the church often cannot spread because of our weakness.</p>
<p>Over the past two thousand years, if the servants of the Lord had always allowed the Holy Spirit to go forward, the church would have matured long ago. If all of us move in a straight line without going in circles, the churches would multiply and be built up in every part of Taiwan. If the Holy Spirit has a straight way in us, the spread of the church would not be limited by us in any way. Any sympathy for human relationships and old ordinances will frustrate the spread of the church. May the Lord have mercy on us. Whoever receives mercy from the Lord will be saved in these matters. The degree to which we are saved is the degree to which the church can spread and be built up.</p>
