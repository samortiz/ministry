   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE TWO ASPECTS OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WATER AND FIRE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9b-10a; 3:24; Dan 7:9-10; Luke 12:49-51; John 7:38-39; 1 Cor 10:4; Rev 4:5; 22:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the matter of life, there are two aspects related to our practical need.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One is our need for the experience of life, and the other is our need for the revelation of the truth in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we lack either of these two aspects, it will be difficult for us to have the knowledge of life and the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most Christians who read the Bible confess that the Bible is consistent from beginning to end and has a unique subject.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, although they acknowledge this fact, they often do not agree on what the unique subject and the consistent line are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, we have to see the central thought of the Bible from the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first mention of man in the Bible is concerning man being created in God s image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This implies that the purpose of God in man is to make man exactly the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the end of the Bible, at the end of Revelation, we see the completion of God s work in man, in which man is exactly the same as God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The twenty-two chapters of the book of Revelation can be divided into two main sections.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first three chapters are one section, and the remaining nineteen chapters are another section.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first three chapters speak of Christ being in the church, and chapters four through twenty-two speak of God being in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first section shows us that Christ is in the midst of the lampstands, and the second section shows us that God is in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the beginning of the second section, God and the throne of God are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God Himself is like a jasper stone 4:3 , and there are seven lamps of fire burning before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God v. 5 . This picture depicts the work of God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This work comes from the One who is like a jasper stone in appearance and from the throne where the fire comes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This work begins from chapter four and continues through chapter twenty-one and produces a city that surrounds the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The wall of the city is also made of jasper 21:18 , having the same color as God in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>GOD S PURPOSE IN THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The purpose of God in the universe is to produce a group of people who will be exactly the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In terms of image, they will be the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is jasper, and they will also be jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In terms of radiance and color, they will also be the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever kind of glory He has, they will also have.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, the condition of these people will be the same as that of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Revelation 4 the One who is sitting on the throne, having the appearance of a jasper stone, is the same as the jasper wall of the city in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the beginning of the universe God was sitting on the throne, and only He had the appearance of a jasper stone, but at the end of God s work in the universe, a jasper wall is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The jasper wall surrounds the One on the throne who is like a jasper stone, indicating that God will eventually gain or produce a group of people who are exactly the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once this issue comes forth, the new heavens and new earth will come, and the eternal rest will begin, because God will have accomplished and fulfilled His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the unique subject of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE UNIQUE SUBJECT OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>MAKING MAN THE SAME AS GOD In Romans</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The unique purpose of God in the universe is to make man exactly the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the unique subject of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to this unique subject, the Bible has a consistent line, which is the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible speaks of this matter from beginning to end. For example, Romans 8:30 says, Those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those whom God predestinated were called by God at a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did God predestinate them?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God predestinated them that they would be conformed to the image of the Son of God v. 29 . God chose us, predestinated us, and called us for the purpose that we would be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants us to be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His Son is the mold of the image.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one has ever seen God, but the Son of God has declared Him John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Colossians 1:15 says that the Son of His love is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Son of God is the image of God, and the image of God is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, God wants to make us exactly the same as His Son.</S>
