We want to see how Christ can be our life in a subjective way.</p><p>In order that we may know and contact Him, God was incarnated to become a man. Through this man we come to realize what God is like. This man was none other than Jesus of Nazareth. He was God clothed with humanity.</p><p>Physically speaking, the body of Jesus was no different from ours. But the life within Him was absolutely of another category. His life was purely the life of God. It had the characteristics of God. God bestows to those who are in Christ the very same life that was embodied in Jesus of Nazareth.</p><h2 class="head1">DEATH RELEASED LIFE</h2><p>However, when Jesus was walking on the earth, the life that He possessed could not be imparted into us. His life was bound by time and space. It was confined to Himself. It could not enter into the believers to be their new source of existence. Therefore, Christ had to die in the flesh. When He died, the bondage of the flesh was shattered and His life was released.</p><p>In John 12:24 the Lord said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." The Lord compared Himself to a grain of wheat. There is life embodied in the seed. When the grain falls into the ground and dies, the life within is released, and much fruit is brought forth.</p><p>Hence, God did not stop at incarnation. He went through death in order that His life would be freed from the flesh and released into the Holy Spirit. He is no longer limited by time and space. His life can now be dispensed unreservedly to all who believe. The death of Christ on the cross was not merely for redemption of sin but also for the release of divine life. The latter is the primary goal, while the former is only a remedial necessity.</p><h2 class="head1">DEATH ALSO SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF SIN</h2><p>However, before we could receive this life, God also had to solve our problem of sin. Hence, the death of Christ had the aspect of redemption with it. Now God has a just ground upon which He can dispense life to us, and we also have a proper standing to receive boldly this new life from God.</p><p>There is a passage in the Bible with which we are quite familiar. John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life." I wish to point out two things in this verse.</p><p>First, it does not say that God loves sinners; it says that God loves the world. The world denotes humanity in general and has a higher sense than sinners. I do not mean to say that God does not love sinners. But the purpose of God in this verse&mdash;the bestowing of eternal life&mdash;is not granted to sinners. Sinners are at a lower level than God's basic requirement for humanity. There is a basic standard upon which God can freely dispense life. But a sinner is below that standard. Hence, before anything could be realized, God had to forgive and deal with our sins. The death of Christ paid the ransom for sin. Now we need no longer be sinners.</p><h2 class="head1">SUMMIT OF SALVATION</h2><p>But receiving the forgiveness of sins merely recovers us back to the state before Adam's fall. He was just a man, and his life was merely a human life at the proper level. But God intends to give His only begotten Son to us so that we may receive eternal life. This is the summit of God's salvation. God is not only recovering what we lost in Adam; He is bestowing what Adam never received. Adam did not eat of the tree of life. Had he not sinned at all, he would still be merely human. He had no relationship with the life of God. But we have inherited something far more excellent in Christ. In addition to a human life, we have a new life, a life from God, which is the very Son of God Himself. This is eternal life.</p><h2 class="head1">ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>What is the meaning of eternal life? It simply means a life of eternity. Man's life is transient; it will not survive in eternity. Only the life of the Son of God can exist there. If I put my own life in eternity, it would shrivel up immediately. It would not last! It would perish as a fish in air or a bird in water. Man's life can only carry him through a temporary existence on this earth. It will not make it through eternity. Only an eternal life can survive in eternity.</p><p>First John 5:11-12 says, "And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life." Here we are told that this life of eternity is in the Son. It is found in no other place. Whoever does not have this life in the Son is merely a human; he can only exist on earth, but not survive in eternity. He does not have that life which qualifies him for eternity.</p><p>After the Son of God passed through death and resurrection and became the Holy Spirit, He is no longer limited by time and space. We can now receive Him anytime and anywhere. Hitherto, whoever received the Son of God received God. In the same way, whoever receives the Holy Spirit receives the Son. First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." This enables all those who have received Christ to obtain a new life. Not only are their sins forgiven, but they inherit an eternal life from God as well.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 27: The Normal Christian Faith &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
