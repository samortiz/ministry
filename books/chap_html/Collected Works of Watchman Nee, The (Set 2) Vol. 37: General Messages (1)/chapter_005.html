<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">PUTTING ON THE HELMET OF SALVATION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:9, 17; 3:6-7; 2 Cor. 1:12; Eph. 6:17; 4:23; Rom. 12:2; 8:5-6</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>In the garden of Eden, there were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God commanded Adam saying, "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:16-17). This shows us that these two trees are in opposition one to another. On one side, there is the tree of life. On the other side, there is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, a tree that leads to death. We can say that one is the tree of life and the other is the tree of death. When man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the result was death. The greatest effect on Adam and Eve after they had sinned was that they acquired knowledge. After they ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they understood good and evil. In other words, the influence of the fall on man's physiological constitution and the first subjective impact it had on man was that man's intellect became bigger than before. Before man fell, he had a mind and an intellect. But after his fall, his mind and intellect became different from what God had intended them to be at the beginning; they were no longer what God wanted them to be. For this reason, Paul said in Ephesians 6:17 that we should "receive the helmet of salvation." This shows that man's "head" needs salvation. After many people believe in the Lord, their life and their living are definitely changed. But with many people their "head" is not yet saved. In spiritual warfare, if our "head" is not saved and covered, we cannot deal with Satan. Therefore, it is important to put on the helmet of salvation; it is important for our "head" to be saved.</p><p>Among God's children, there is a great problem: we can find excellent men, and we can find men with good behavior, but they all have a "head" that belongs to the old creation. In other words, they have the life of Christ, but they still have the "head" of Adam. This frustrates them from understanding God's will. To measure a person's spiritual life, all we have to do is measure his "head." The degree to which a man is saved from his "head" is the degree to which he is saved from Adam and the old creation. The basic difference between living in the old creation and living in the new creation lies in the condition of the "head" before God.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Second Corinthians 1:12 says, "Not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world." All of us who consider ourselves to be clever, shrewd, and great need to look to God for His deliverance. We need to realize that the principle of the Christian life is to be according to God's will and not according to our wisdom. It is trusting in His grace rather than in our wisdom. This is the one thing that we have to learn.</p><p>Suppose a matter is presented to you, and you do not know whether you should do it, or you do not know how to do it in the proper way. You consider and reconsider, pondering this way and that. You think if you do it this way, you will have this result, and if you do it that way, you will have that result. If you say this, others will answer in one way, and if you say that, others will answer in another way. You think you should be a little more clever in handling the situation. What does it mean to be clever? It means to face the least difficulty and avoid the most opposition in saying or doing something. But you have forgotten that God's children do not live on earth in fleshly wisdom. Being a Christian is a simple thing. All we need to do is ask what God wants.</p><p>We must realize that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that was in the garden of Eden is still growing among God's children today. Many of God's children are still eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil day and night instead of the fruit of the tree of life. They still ask if they should do this or that, and they are still entangled with questions of good and evil. Paul said that it is a simple matter to live before God; we do not live in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God. We are responsible for one thing only, doing His will.</p>
