   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DESTROYING THE TEMPLE OF GOD, THE CHURCH,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY BOASTING IN SPIRITUAL GIANTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To boast in spiritual giants is also to destroy the temple of God, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To do this is to be in the flesh and to walk according to men 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we must be careful not to have preferences in elders, co-workers, or in brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Along with learning not to bring our nature, being, and doings into the church, we must also learn not to have preferences for any persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we exalt a certain person, we shall mar, defile, destroy, the temple of God, and we shall suffer God s punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THINKING OURSELVES TO BE WISE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>AND BEING SELF-DECEIVED</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 18 Paul says, Let no one deceive himself: if anyone among you thinks himself to be wise in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both the Judaizing believers and the philosophizing Greek believers deceived themselves by bringing the elements of Judaism and Greek philosophy into the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The apostle s thought here centers mainly on those Greek believers who highly esteemed the wisdom of their philosophy 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To boast in spiritual giants is also to think ourselves to be wise and thus to be self-deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who exalt a certain person regard themselves as wiser than others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ones who exercise their philosophical mind are those who exalt others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To think ourselves more clever than others and to exalt certain persons is to be self-deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Exalting spiritual giants not only destroys the church; it also causes us to be self-deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the context of verse 18, deceiving ourselves is related to exalting man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, many think that there is nothing wrong with exalting others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, someone may say, Brother So-and-so is one of the best elders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I like him, and I am for him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This may sound harmless, but it is actually damaging to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Lord s recovery there must not be the exalting of any person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BECOMING FOOLISH</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>IN ORDER TO HAVE GOD S WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 18 Paul charges the one who thinks himself to be wise in this age to become foolish that he may become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To become foolish here is to forsake the wisdom of philosophy and receive the simple word concerning Christ and His cross 1:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To become wise is to take the wisdom of God in making Christ everything to us 1:24, 30; 2:6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although it is easy to become wise and difficult to become foolish, everyone in the Lord s recovery must learn to become foolish in the sense in which Paul speaks in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually all believers today are Greeks, for we are philosophical in our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, we need to become foolish in order that we may become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more foolish we become in the proper sense, the more enjoyment we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the more we become wise in a philosophical way, the less enjoyment we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, the growth in life in the churches depends on this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are all willing to become foolish, we shall experience much progress in the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church life it is necessary that we learn to become foolish that we may have God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then God s revelation will come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who receive the most revelation from God are those who have learned to become foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, they have God s wisdom.</S>
