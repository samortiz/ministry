   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 1:2 also says, "Isaac begot Jacob."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaac and Ishmael were brothers by the same father, but by different mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jacob and Esau were more intimate; they were twins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob means a superseder.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He supersedes others, puts them under him, and climbs above them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When he and his older brother Esau were coming out of the womb, Jacob held Esau's heel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jacob seemed to be saying, "Esau, don't go yet!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wait for me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let me go first!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jacob was a real heel-holder.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The meaning of the name Jacob is the heel-holder, the supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Beat others down.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Put them under your feet by any deceitful means.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because God had already chosen Jacob, all his endeavors were in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob needed a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not need to supplant others, because God had chosen him to be number one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even before the twins were born, God had told the mother that the younger would be the first, and the elder would be second.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated" Mal 1:2-3; Rom 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unfortunately, Jacob did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he had, he never would have tried to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, he would have said to Esau, "If you want to go out first, just go out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter how much you try to be first, I will still be first.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You can never beat me because God elected me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jacob, however, did not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even when he had grown up, he still did not realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, he was constantly supplanting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Wherever he went, he supplanted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He supplanted his brother Gen 25:29-33; 27:18-38 , and he supplanted his uncle Gen 30:37 31:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He schemed and he stole from his uncle, Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet, all his labor was in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God could say, "Stupid Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You don't need to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I will give you more than what you have gained."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But Jacob kept striving.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although he was a descendant of Abraham, according to his striving and his nature, he was altogether a descendant of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Positionally speaking, Jacob was a descendant of Abraham, but dispositionally speaking, he was a child of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What did Jacob need?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He needed God's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, God raised up his brother, Esau, and then his uncle, Laban, to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God even raised up four wives plus twelve male helpers and a female helper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was a great deal of suffering in the life of Jacob, but this suffering came from his striving, not from God's election.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more Jacob strove, the more he suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may laugh at Jacob, but we are exactly the same as he.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we try to do something, the more problems we have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Christ, we need, firstly, the life of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to forget what we are, live by Christ, and trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Secondly, in Christ we have no need of Ishmael, our doing; we need Isaac, His doing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thirdly, we do not need Jacob, but Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not need the natural Jacob, but the transformed Israel, the prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you realize that it is absolutely not up to you?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you hear this, you may say, "If it is not up to me, but completely up to God, then I'll stop my seeking."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you can stop your seeking, I encourage you to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Tell the whole universe that you have heard that it is up to Him, and that you have stopped your seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you can stop it, it should be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But, I assure you, the more you stop, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The more you stop, the more He will stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Try it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Tell the Lord, "Lord, I stop my seeking!"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord would say, "That's wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your stopping opens the door for Me to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I will burn you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You may stop your seeking, but I will burn you!"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all have been elected.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In a sense, we are caught.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What can we do?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can never get away.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is absolutely due to the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We did not choose this way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I certainly did not choose it, but here I am.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What can I do?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What can I say?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because God has chosen us, we can never get away.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we read Romans 9, we shall discover that it is up to Him, not us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was and still is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Praise Him that His mercy has come to us!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No one can reject His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We may reject His doing, but we can never reject His mercy Exo 33:19; Rom 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What a mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ and to participate in Him as God's eternal blessing!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In one sense we are Abraham, in another sense we are Isaac, and in still another sense, we are Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Later, in a fourth sense, we shall be Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Thus, we have Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The genealogy of Christ is a matter of the birthright, and the birthright is mainly the association with Christ and the participation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Jacob's supplanting was not justified, but his seeking after the birthright surely was honored by God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Esau despised the birthright and sold it cheaply Gen 25:29-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Thus, he lost it and was not able to get it back, even when he regretted and wept for it Gen 27:34-38; Heb 12:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He had lost the blessing of participating in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This should be a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Jacob respected and sought the birthright, and he obtained it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He inherited God's promised blessing, the blessing of Christ Gen 28:4, 14 .</S>
