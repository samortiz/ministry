   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Five Questions on</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not Being Dissimilarly Yoked</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have believed in the Lord and you know what righteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must deal with your former unrighteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must deal with whatever you owe to others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But unbelievers, even the most moral ones, do not know what righteousness means.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The two are diametrically the opposite of each other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Righteousness and unrighteousness have no partnership with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot take advantage of others in even the smallest way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps some people like to take advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past you might have thought that this was smart, but now you realize that this is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How can righteousness have partnership with unrighteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your views are basically different now.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, righteousness can have no partnership with unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, What fellowship does light have with darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have been enlightened, and now you see.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The other person is in darkness and cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A child of God, who has made some progress on his spiritual journey already and who has some depth in the Lord, will find it difficult even to fellowship with a fleshly Christian who lives in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How much more difficult would it be for him to commune with one who is totally in darkness and sees nothing?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At least you have been enlightened by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here is a basic contradiction: Light has no fellowship with darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unbelievers can do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their philosophies, ethical standards, and outlook on life are different from those of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Believers are in the light, while unbelievers are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can they fellowship and commune with one another?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are basically different in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Third, And what concord does Christ have with Belial?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Belial refers to Satan and contemptible things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Satan is surely contemptible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We belong to the Lord, while unbelievers belong to Belial.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are honorable 1 Pet 2:9 , and they are cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We were bought with a high price, with the blood of the Son of God, not with corruptible gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have our Christian standing, our dignity as believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are many things which we cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can bargain with a rickshaw-coolie within a reasonable limit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But it would be wrong for me to bargain beyond that limit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are Christians, and we cannot go beyond certain limits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot bargain too much with others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must not lose our Christian dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are worth more than the few cents that we bargain for.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot lower ourselves to the level of the street hawkers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to maintain our Christian standing and our Christian dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some people belong to Belial.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They may do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may take advantage of others or make gain for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we cannot do the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have our Christian honor and status.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can these two kinds of people be in harmony with one another?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One is pulling to one side, and the other is pulling to the opposite side.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The two cannot be yoked together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Putting them under one yoke will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The yoke will surely break.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Please remember that many people are not that honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are, in fact, rather ignoble.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christians, however, are noble people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The two are totally different; they cannot be yoked together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After one becomes a Christian, he cannot develop strong friendship with unbelievers, because he is incompatible with them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Fourth, Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a repetition of the question prior to it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is another comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You have faith, and the other person does not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You know God in faith, but the other person does not believe in God and does not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You find faith in your life, but the other person does not have faith in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You trust in God, while he has no trust.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You look to God, while he looks to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You say that everything is in God s hand, but he says that everything is in his own hand.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The two are basically different.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We often cannot communicate even with nominal Christians; we cannot fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They say that they are Christians, but they have no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is a problem here.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not only is the conduct of the two persons different, but one has faith while the other does not.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The conduct is different because the measure of faith is different.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>With this difference, it is hard to have any communication at all.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A believer has nothing to do with an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A believer spontaneously trusts in God in many things; it is as natural as breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But this is hard to an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He would say that the believer is superstitious, backward, or foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is no way for us to make friends with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They will pull us down, and the pull will be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Fifth, What agreement does the temple of God have with idols?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What is the temple of God?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What is an idol?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I think this refers to the sanctification of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Following this, it says that we are the temple of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the book of 1 Corinthians, the believers bodies are considered the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>One group of people were idol worshippers, while the other group of people said, Our bodies are the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We cannot defile the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What we do with our friends is related very much to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Drinking, smoking, and other activities all affect the body; they touch the body.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But the body is the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>One should not destroy this temple or defile it.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must preserve our body as we preserve God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The living God dwells in us, and we must not destroy this temple.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We are the temple of God, while they are the temple of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They are related to idols, visible or invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They do not care for the holiness of the body, but we do.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Do you see the difference here?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>How can the two be yoked together?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We can never be friends with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>There is only one result if we befriend them we are dragged down with them.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should never think that we are strong and steadfast and that it is all right for us to make a few unbelieving friends.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Let me say that we have been Christians for many years, but we are still fearful of making friends with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>A relationship with them invariably brings loss to us.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We should contact them only for the sake of bringing them to a meeting or testifying to them.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Apart from this, all other contact is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Once we are in their midst, we will have to sacrifice our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It will be hard for us to maintain our Christian standard when we are among them.</S>
