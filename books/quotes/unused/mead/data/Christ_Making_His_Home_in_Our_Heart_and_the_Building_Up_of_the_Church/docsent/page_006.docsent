   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE CROSS SOLVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROBLEM OF MAN S SIN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR MAN S REGENERATION Scripture Reading: Rom 7:8, 17; 8:3; Num 21:4-9; John 3:14-16; 1 Pet 2:24 MAN HAVING SIN Three Aspects of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sinful Deeds, the Sinful Nature,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and the Record of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to see how man can obtain the highest life, God s life, we need to see that we are different from Adam when he was first in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the beginning in the garden of Eden, Adam had the created human life but not the uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Similarly, when we were born, we also had the created human life but not the uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we have something more than Adam had; in the beginning in the garden of Eden, Adam was sinless, but we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sin involves both outward sins and inward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two aspects of sin result in a third aspect a record of sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever sin is mentioned, these three aspects are involved: one is outside of us, another is inside of us, and the third is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Outside of us are sinful deeds, sinful acts; inside of us is a sinful nature, a sinful disposition; and at the same time, before God there is a record of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sinful deeds refer to sinful acts, such as lying, reviling, cheating, and stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe that we all have stolen something from others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the least we have stolen from our parents; some steal candy, and others steal money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our heart we all know what we have stolen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, we all have hated others and been jealous of others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, we are discontent when we score ninety-seven in an exam but someone else scores ninety-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are sinful acts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sinful nature refers to an element in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our nature there is an element called sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 7:8 says, Sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the sin in us is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not only living; it also has power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 17 says, Now then it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse points out that sin with its power dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word dwells is a particular verb.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not say that a bench dwells in a room, because a bench is not living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can say that a dog or a cat dwells in a room, because they are living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For something to dwell, it must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sin not only lives in us; it also dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we should never think that sin refers only to the sinful deeds we commit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is something living in us that drives us to commit sins and that thing is our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man Having a Sinful Nature,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>and Sin Having Power</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 6:6 and 14 say that we are slaves of sin and that sin is ruling over us as our lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sin dwells in us as our lord, and the power of sin is able to rule us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only so, sin also has the power to force us to do the things that we dislike.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This can be likened to a person who is standing in the middle of a river.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The river exerts such power on the person that he is carried along by the flow of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sin in us has this kind of power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It will cause us to do the things that we hate and go to places that we dislike.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This proves that the sin in us is living and has authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE SINFUL NATURE IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BEING THE NATURE OF SATAN, THE DEVIL</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is this sinful nature, the power of sin, within man?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To put it simply, it is the nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we were saved, we were born of God to have the life and nature of God; in the same way, when man fell, he was born of Satan, to have the life and nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible says that all who sin are children of the devil 1 John 3:10; John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every child is born of his father and, hence, has his father s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the descendants of Adam are sinners and children of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are born of the devil and have the life and nature of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This nature of the devil within us is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The sinful nature in us is the nature of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone who is saved has God s nature within him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This nature of God, which is God Himself, is the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the same principle, fallen sinners as Adam s descendants have the sinful nature within them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This sinful nature is the nature of the devil, or we may say that it is the devil himself, his element.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When someone says that the devil is in us, perhaps we do not believe it, or we may even become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if someone says to me that I am a wicked person, I would reply, Of course I am.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since I have the devil in me, how can I not be wicked?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When Adam was created, he was pure and had only the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, one day he received Satan s word and ate the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, Satan, through his word and through the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, entered into Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>From that time Adam was no longer pure, because within Adam there was not only the element of man but also the element of Satan, the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can use a glass of water as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Originally, Adam was like a glass of water.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the garden of Eden he was very pure.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, one day Satan, through his word and the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, injected his element and thoughts into Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>From that time onward, Adam was no longer pure; instead, he was filled with Satan s poisonous element.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Adam became another person; he became the devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whom do you look like when you are angry or play mah-jongg?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you look at yourself in the mirror, will you see a demon or a human being?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You may seem to be kind and polite and to look like a human being who is very proper.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, since you are fallen, you are contaminated and damaged, and you have the poisonous element of Satan in you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I am not saying this in a casual way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The gamblers in a casino look like demons.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Chinese refer to gamblers as gambling demons, drunkards as drinking demons, and opium-smokers as opium demons.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There are all kinds of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When people commit sin, they look like the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Initially, Adam was like a glass of water; however, Satan, through his words and the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, injected his thoughts as poison into Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, as Adam s descendants, we have inherited this poison in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, we are not only human beings from birth; we are also contaminated with the element of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to admit that as sinners our sinning is involuntary; it is not dependent on us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The first time a person plays mah-jongg, he may think that he likes it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Later, however, he becomes sick and tired of playing and even hates playing mah-jongg.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>At this time he discovers that whether or not he plays mah-jongg is not up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He discovers that there is a force within him that propels him and forces him to play.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There was once a man who played mah-jongg to the extent that he felt that he was imprisoned by it.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then he began to hate playing mah-jongg.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, he could not stop playing, because there was a force in him propelling him to play.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There was another person who would dance until two or three in the morning every day.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It was as if his two legs would mysteriously begin to dance as soon as the sun went down.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After dancing, his back would ache and his legs would be sore, such that he lay on the bed and wondered why he caused himself to suffer so much.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When he woke up in the morning, he would tell himself that he would never go dancing again.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, as soon as the sun set, inexplicably he would go to the dance hall.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When he finished dancing and returned home, he would berate and loathe himself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It was not until he was saved that he realized that it was not he who went to dance but that there was an evil power, an evil nature or a corrupted life, within him that propelled him, forced him, and pushed him to dance.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Those who drink, smoke, or gamble will invariably discover that there is an evil force compelling them to do these things.</S>
