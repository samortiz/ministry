   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Indicating God's Desire That Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Would Eat the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>to Receive God into Him as His Life</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's warning to man concerning not eating the tree of knowledge indicates three things: God's greatness, God's love, and God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's desire was that man would eat the tree of life to receive God into him as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God did not force man to take what He wanted man to take, but He left this decision up to man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His warning man indicates that, on the one hand, He was great and, on the other hand, He was loving.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not force man to do what He desired.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That shows that He was great.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet He warned man not to take the wrong thing, and this implies that God had love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He put man mainly in front of two trees, and He warned man not to take the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That surely implies that God wanted man to take the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, God's warning indicates His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wanted man to take the tree of life, that is, God Himself, into man as man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This message is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a kind of revolutionizing concept to the human mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must have this message as a preparation for the saints to go on in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Question: What is the best way to show that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil represents Satan's life?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Answer: The Bible shows us that in this whole universe there are only two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan came in to seduce man to partake of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That means that Satan captured man by getting man to take him in. This is a big thing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The tree of life and the tree of knowledge actually are the two controlling lines through the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the families, in the nations, and even in the churches, God is here as the tree of life, and Satan is here as the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Which way would you take and whom would you contact?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you contact God, you get life and you depend upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you take the tree of knowledge, you get Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you get Satan, you become independent from God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To become independent means to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more you take the tree of knowledge, the more you rebel against God and become independent from God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you take the tree of knowledge, you become one with Satan, who was and still is a rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you take the tree of life, you are one with God and become dependent upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These two principles are with us today, but most people always take the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is very rare to see persons who would take the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even in our daily life, we have to admit that we take the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a husband argues with his wife, he is taking the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we argue about who is wrong and who is right, the more of the tree of knowledge we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result we become deadened and independent from God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we have to repent and confess.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to get the cleansing of the precious blood, and the blood brings us back into contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we contact God again, we become dependent on God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The next time we are tempted to argue we should say, "Lord, if You don't debate, I don't debate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If You don't argue, I don't argue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am one with You."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all need to live a dependent life of the tree of life and turn away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
