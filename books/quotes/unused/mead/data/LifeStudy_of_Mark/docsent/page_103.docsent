   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE THE PREPARATION OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 2 Scripture Reading: Mark 11:1-26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue to consider the preparation of the Slave-Savior for His redemptive service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message we saw that the first step of His preparation was entering into Jerusalem in a glorious way and receiving the acknowledgment, the approval, of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE CURSING OF THE FIG TREE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AND THE CLEANSING OF THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 11:12-26 we have the cursing of the fig tree and the cleansing of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord saw the fig tree with nothing on it except leaves, and in verse 14 He said to it, May no one eat fruit of you forever!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After cursing the fig tree, He entered into the temple and began to cast out those who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who were selling the doves v. 15 . Then He said, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers v. 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two actions the cursing of the fig tree and cleansing of the temple indicate that the entire nation of Israel, which had been chosen by God for His purpose, had become fruitless and corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fig tree cursed by the Lord had leaves, but no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It had outward glorification, but it did not have any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It did not have any reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It had nothing that could satisfy God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The temple, which should have been a house of prayer for all nations, the Gentiles as well as the Jews, had become a den of robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the sight of God, those worshipping in the temple were robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s house on earth actually had become a den of robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, after cursing the fig tree to end its life, the Lord cleansed the temple in order to eliminate the corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Lord was doing these things, no one dared to oppose Him outwardly, for He had already received the people s approval.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning this, verse 18 says, And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and they sought how they might destroy Him, for they feared Him, for all the crowd was astounded at His teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cursing of the fig tree signifies the terminating of the life of Israel as a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From that time onward, the nation of Israel was finished with God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In addition to cursing the fig tree, the Lord also cleansed the corruption from the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the first ten chapters of the Gospel of Mark the Lord was kind, merciful, and compassionate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But here in 11:12-26 it seems that He is very different, first cursing the fig tree and then cleansing the temple, even overturning the tables of the moneychangers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to verse 16, He did not permit anyone to carry a vessel through the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord was very bold, strong, and even severe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He seemed to show no mercy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to see that the cursing of the fig tree and the cleansing of the temple were part of the Slave-Savior s preparation for His redemptive death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He prepared the way for the Pharisees and scribes to put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was late in the day when the Lord cleansed the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 19 says, And when it became late, they went outside the city.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is likely that during the night He lodged in Bethany.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A WORD CONCERNING FAITH AND PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mark 11:20 says, And passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Remembering what the Lord Jesus had said the previous day, Peter said to Him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which You cursed has withered v. 21 . The Lord answered by saying, Have faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Truly I tell you, that whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says happens, it shall be to him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the Lord went on to speak about prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In particular He pointed out our need to forgive others: And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, that your Father who is in the heavens may also forgive you your offenses v. 25 . Here we see that to forgive the offenses of others is the ground for our heavenly Father to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is especially true in our prayer time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Strictly speaking, we cannot pray with a heart that holds anything against anyone, that is, with a heart that feels offended by anyone or remembers another s offense.</S>
