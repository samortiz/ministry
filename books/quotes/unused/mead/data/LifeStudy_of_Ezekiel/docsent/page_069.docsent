   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Setting Up David as a Shepherd over Them</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 23 goes on to say, And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>David typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the real David, the real Shepherd, feeding us and causing us to be filled and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Taking Care of Us</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As our Shepherd Christ takes care of us, including all our problems and responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He takes care of us not only in spiritual things but in all things related to our human needs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that, according to Psalm 23, He takes care of us in every aspect of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the Lord Jesus is our Shepherd taking care of us, we should not worry about our problems or about our living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, we need to learn to put our trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the end of the day, it is very good to pray to the Lord as our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no need to pray at length in a formal, religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Simply say, Lord Jesus, I thank You that I am under Your care.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now I am going to sleep, and I ask You to come and take care of me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a simple prayer is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you wake up in the morning, you say, Lord, I thank You that I am still under Your care.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need to be religious, asking the Lord to protect you and do many other things for you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you pray in a religious way, the Lord might say, Child, I know what you need.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not waste your time and do not burden Me with this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Simply enjoy My care.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus truly is our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I could give many testimonies of how I have enjoyed His care throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wherever I have gone and wherever I have worked, I have been under His shepherding care.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I rejoice that we are under the care of our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not a flock without a Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His recovery we, as His flock, are under His constant shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As He cares for us, He feeds us, and we have the real experience of Psalm 23: The Lord is our Shepherd, and we have no want.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May we all learn to experience Christ as our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Coming to Be the King</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord Jesus comes as the Shepherd, He comes also as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The issue of the Lord s caring for us as our Shepherd is that we obey Him as our King and come under His kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord is our Shepherd to be our King, and He is our King to be our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand He shepherds us; on the other hand, He governs us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we receive the Lord s shepherding, we understand the Lord s throne, kingdom, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is shepherding us with His care and supply so that we may be subject to His kingship and that He may set up His throne and His kingdom within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Making a Covenant of Peace with Them</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Certain portions of Ezekiel speak of God s covenant with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ezekiel 16:60 and 62 say, Nevertheless, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant....And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 37:26a the Lord promises, Moreover, I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once a matter has been covenanted, it is established and secure and it cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, this covenant of peace is established, secure, and unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we experience the Lord s shepherding and remain under His kingship, we enjoy His peace and are no longer subject to spiritual troubles and disturbances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regarding this covenant there are a number of points that deserve our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Causing the Evil Beasts to Cease out of the Land</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ezekiel 34:25a says, I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we are told that, under the Lord s shepherding, all the evil beasts will be kept away from the Lord s recovered people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to Paul s word in Acts 20:29 evil beasts fierce wolves refer to evil persons who disturb God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the proper church life there are no wolves, only lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In His recovery the Lord causes the evil beasts to cease.</S>
