<P>The apostle John stressed fruit-bearing in his Gospel, telling us that we are the branches of the divine vine, the organism of the Triune God (John 15:5, 16). As His branches, our first responsibility is to bear fruit. In Revelation, John speaks not of the fruit-bearing branches but of the priests of the New Testament in the church, the kingdom age, and in eternity (1:6; 5:10; 20:6). We may think that the fruit-bearing branches in John's Gospel and the serving priests in Revelation are two different things. Actually, they are one. The branches' bearing fruit is the real service of the New Testament priesthood.</P><P>The apostle John told us that we, the New Testament believers, are priests, but he did not tell us what to offer. As a young Christian, I sought to know what we as New Testament priests should offer. I was told that we firstly have to offer our praises and our good conduct to God. I was also told that our giving of material things to others could be considered as an offering to God. However, these are not the main offerings in the New Testament. In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a New Testament priest, offering the sinners saved from the nations as sacrifices to God. He also said that he was poured out as a drink offering (Phil. 2:17), and he charged all the New Testament saints to offer themselves as living sacrifices (Rom. 12:1). Paul's concept was that he was working on the believers for Christ, ministering Christ to them that he might present them full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28) as sacrifices to God. As the New Testament priests, we should offer to God the sinners saved through our preaching of the gospel. After being saved, they become members of Christ, and since they are the members of the corporate Christ, we offer them as sacrifices to God. The Old Testament priests offered the types of Christ; we offer the increase of Christ, the reality of Christ.</P><P>The high point of Peter's Epistles is the portion concerning the priesthood. He presented the New Testament priesthood in a very marvelous way. He said, "You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 2:5). In verse 9 he said, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light." As the New Testament priests, we must be built up into a corporate priesthood to tell out the virtues of God. In this verse Peter did not speak in a common way of preaching the gospel of God's grace, love, kindness, and forgiveness. Rather, he used an extraordinary expression: "tell out the virtues of Him." To "tell out" is to preach, and some of "the virtues" are God's grace, love, kindness, forgiveness, and light. We should have the concept that when we go to preach the gospel, we are going to tell out God's virtues.</P><P>Verse 9 says that God called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. In this verse Peter does not directly mention salvation or the kingdom. Rather, he speaks of God's marvelous light. Light is an indication of God's salvation and of God's kingdom. We have to go out to tell out God's virtues that people may be called out of their darkness into the marvelous light of God. This is to bring them into the kingdom of God. By this we can see that the first responsibility a local church must bear is to tell out the virtues of God, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</P>
