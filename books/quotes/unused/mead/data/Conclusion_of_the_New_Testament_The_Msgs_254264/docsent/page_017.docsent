   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Having Been the Bride of Christ in the Millennium</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the new heaven and new earth Christ will have a wife, but in the millennium He will have a bride Rev 19:7-8; 21:2 , consisting of the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At His coming back Christ will marry the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This marriage is described in Revelation 19:7-9.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 19:7 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be completed at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the bride, who will consist of the overcoming believers, will be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The words His wife in Revelation 19:7 refer to the church Eph 5:24-25, 31-32 , the bride of Christ John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, according to Revelation 19:8 and 9, the wife, the bride of Christ, consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride, the wife, in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Revelation 19:7b tells us that the wife "has made herself ready."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The readiness of the bride depends on both the overcomers' maturity in life and on their being built up together as a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the overcomers are not only mature in life but also built up together as one bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation 19:8 says, "It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here pure refers to the nature and bright, to the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The righteousnesses, or righteous acts, do not refer to the righteousness which is Christ we received for our salvation, a righteousness that is objective and that qualifies us to meet the requirement of the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The righteousnesses of the overcoming believers in Revelation 19:8 are subjective so that they may meet the requirement of the overcoming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fine linen, therefore, indicates our overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is actually the Christ whom we live out of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. Constituted of All the Perfected Saints</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ultimately, in the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem as the wife of the redeeming Christ will be constituted of all the perfected saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the millennium all the saints will have been perfected and constituted together to be the wonderful entity of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The consummation of the church as the counterpart of Christ will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation 21:2 says, "I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed and perfected by God throughout all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the bride, the wife, of Christ as His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the wife of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ and becomes His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She is prepared by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 22:17 indicates that Christ and the New Jerusalem as His wife will be a universal couple for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit, who is the totality of the processed Triune God, becomes one with the believers, who are now fully matured to be the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the consummation of the processed Triune God and the consummation of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people will be one and will be a universal couple expressing the Triune God for eternity.</S>
