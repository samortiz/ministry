   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE BEING PRUNED BY THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO LIVE A FRUIT-BEARING LIFE Scripture Reading: John 15:2, 5; 1:29, 32-48; Matt 4:13-16, 18-22 FRUIT-BEARING BEING THE NORMAL LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE BRANCHES OF THE VINE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Throughout the past centuries, many matters concerning the Christian life and church life were lost in the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, today the Lord desires to have a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This recovery includes fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A proper Christian life is a fruit-bearing life, because we are the branches of the vine John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s operation in the universe is with His vine, and we are all the branches of this vine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The normal life of the branches is nothing other than to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whatever else a branch on a vine can do means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In actuality, branches can do nothing but bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, to bear fruit is the normal living of the branches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The important matter is not how long it takes us to bear one fruit; what is important is that we do bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To bear fruit is not merely a work, and it is not simply the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we could ask a branch on the vine what it is doing, it would say, I am doing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am simply enjoying the life of the vine, living, and growing, and out of this kind of living, fruit spontaneously comes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fruit-bearing is not a mere work or preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A living is always according to a certain life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Cats, for example, live day and night according to a cat s life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To catch mice is not their job; it is their living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, for dogs to bark is not their job; it is their living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are branches of the vine, and our living is simply to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not to bear fruit means that we are abnormal, not right in our Christian life and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>DEALING WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TO BE NEW, FRESH, AND TENDER BRANCHES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we said in the previous chapter, the three tests of whether we are right are the church life, fruit-bearing, and caring for younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not bear fruit or take care of younger ones, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 15:2 says, Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one should say he is too old to be a fruit-bearing branch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For someone to say this indicates that he needs to be pruned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For a branch to bear fruit, it must be new, fresh, and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way to be new, fresh, and tender is to be pruned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To understand the Bible in a proper way is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may think that we should wait until the Father prunes us before we bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we wait, however, the Father may not do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, we must all go to the Lord to deal with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the meaning of being pruned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our physical age means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether we are old or new in the presence of the Lord depends upon our thorough dealing with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To deal with the Lord properly is not to say, Lord, I was wrong in the past because I did not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From now on I will endeavor and do whatever You demand me to do to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a poor way to deal with the Lord; it is not a dealing but a willing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul says, To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we will to do is a work, not a living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not make up our mind and will to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we must go to the Lord to deal with Him by opening ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we go to the Lord in this way, we receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At first we may not have much light, but if we obey the light we receive and deal with what the light condemns, we will receive more light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must go to the Lord to have a thorough dealing with Him, opening ourselves and presenting ourselves to Him without any covering for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must strip off our cover as much as possible and present ourselves fully on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should say, Lord, here I am.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Come to enlighten me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Shine upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Investigate, examine, test, and expose me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do everything You can to bring me fully into the light that I may see my real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do this, we will immediately see several items that we must deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Perhaps the first item we need to deal with concerns our wife.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may need to say, Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am constantly wrong in my attitude toward my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then the Lord will demand that we go to her to make a thorough confession and ask her forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It seems that this has nothing to do with the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, we are not speaking of a mere work of gospel preaching; we are speaking of fruit-bearing as the issue of a proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After reading the previous chapter, some may go to the Lord to say, O Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the past I was sloppy and abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have not preached the gospel to my in-laws, my cousins, and my schoolmates.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lord, starting from now please help me to contact others and care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As we have said, this is not a Christian living; it is merely a willing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should never forget that to will is present with us, but to work out the good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What we must do is go to the Lord to have a thorough dealing with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the sisters, for example, mean business with the Lord when they go to Him in this way, He may touch them concerning their shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>With many of the young people, especially the young sisters, shopping is truly a snare, and they do not care for the Lord adequately when they shop.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the morning they may say, Lord, I offer myself to You as a burnt offering to satisfy You, but afterward they may read in the newspaper about a sale and make up their mind to go shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As the tender branches, they should be the ones who bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, they have been damaged simply by their shopping apart from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Shopping in a worldly way deadens our spirit and reduces our love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we mean business with the Lord to have a thorough dealing with Him, the Lord may come first to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we will need to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should say, O Lord, how much I need to be saved in Your life from my shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some of the married sisters also, both in the Far East and in America, are addicted to buying things.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some wives already have dozens of pairs of shoes and several sets of silverware, but they still like to buy more.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>At least, they like to window shop.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This kind of addiction kills the sisters spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The reason that some sisters are old, fruitless branches is that they are old in the matter of buying things.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If the sisters mean business with the Lord to bear fruit, the Lord may say, Go home and get rid of all but five pairs of shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the Father s pruning.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some sisters also love their hair, and in these modern times, even the young men love their long hair and beards.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some brothers may allow the Lord to touch anything but their hair.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Their hair is a kind of Holy of Holies to them, and their beard is a sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In order to bear fruit, the brothers must let the Lord prune them in the matter of their haircut and beard.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A brother may not have borne one fruit in many years, but if he will allow the Lord to prune him concerning his hair, he may bring someone to the Lord after only one month.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All these worldly, fleshly, and natural desires, likes, attractions, and addictions need to be pruned.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then we will become fresh, new, and tender.</S>
