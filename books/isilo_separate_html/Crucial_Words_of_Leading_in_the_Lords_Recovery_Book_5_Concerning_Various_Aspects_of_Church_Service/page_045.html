<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
IN THE WAY OF COMPELLING PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 14:15-23</h1>
<p>The Lord always leads us forward. We hope that the church life will now have a new beginning. In order for the church life to have a new beginning, we need to promote and carry out the small groups. The goal of promoting the small groups is first to bring in new ones, then to recover those who have not been meeting, and lastly to uphold the saints who meet regularly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST GOAL OF THE SMALL GROUPS<br />
BEING TO BRING IN NEW ONES</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, to bring in new ones is to preach the gospel and lead people to the Lord. In promoting the small groups, we first need to encourage the saints to bring in new ones. When we came to Taiwan, we were rather successful in preaching and promoting the gospel. Almost all the saints in the church in Taipei were mobilized to distribute gospel tracts to every door on the street where they lived. As a result, in one week every household in the city of Taipei received a gospel tract.</p>
<p>We printed many gospel banners, such as &ldquo;God so loved the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jesus Christ came to the world to save sinners,&rdquo; and we posted them in streets, alleys, and crossroads, and at train stations and bus stops. At that time there were not many high-rise buildings; most buildings were Japanese-style houses. The saints posted banners on both sides of the front door of their house. If someone walked on the street and saw gospel banners posted on the two sides of a front door, he knew that it was the house of a saint.</p>
<p>In addition, we often conducted gospel marches on Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoons. The saints would walk to Taipei City New Park and preach the gospel in the outdoor amphitheater, which had enough seats to hold about three thousand people. We often filled the seats. After every gospel meeting, we usually received about five hundred names. The next evening the saints would gather together, and the names would be distributed to the saints. Everyone received a burden from the Lord and visited the gospel friends. In this way we contacted over two thousand new ones within a month. One time we baptized seven hundred. Many of those who were newly saved later became elders, deacons, and deaconesses in various localities all over Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMPELLING PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>During those years, the fire of the gospel was indeed burning among us. However, we did not reach the stage of going out and compelling people. In Luke 14:23 the Lord Jesus told us that to go out and bring people in, we even need to go to the roads and hedges and compel people. According to the original Greek, to compel people means to force people. The Lord said, &ldquo;Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.&rdquo; Our burden is to teach you how to compel others. The Lord Jesus spoke of our need to compel others.</p>
<p>In verse 23 the Lord said that we should compel people to come in. Then in verse 26 He said, &ldquo;If anyone comes to Me and does not hate.&rdquo; These two matters spoken of in Luke 14 are quite harsh. First, we have to go out and compel people to believe in the Lord. Second, after they believe, they have to &ldquo;hate.&rdquo; Seemingly, this is against what Christianity teaches about being kind, loving, and broad, but this is indeed the Lord&rsquo;s word. Not only do we have to hate our parents and our wife, we also have to hate our self. The teaching of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; is quite particular. Hymns #664 in Chinese says, &ldquo;Rise up quickly and preach the gospel!&rdquo; But the Lord&rsquo;s word goes even further; He wants us to rise up quickly and compel people. The secret to preaching the gospel is to have a zealous heart, to be crazy. A person who is crazy does not care for himself. Forty years ago I was crazy whenever I preached the gospel. However, I was not crazy to the extent of compelling others. For this reason, I feel that I am still indebted to the gospel.</p>
<p>Our main impression concerning the Gospel of Luke is that it is a sweet gospel. It tells us that the Lord Jesus is a good shepherd who is full of compassion. In His tender love He looks for us, He embraces and bears us, and He brings us back to His flock (15:1-7). This Gospel also tells us that the Lord is a good Samaritan. We are wounded and on the verge of death, but He binds our wounds and pours oil and wine on them (10:25-35). However, we never saw the matter that the Lord Jesus wants us to go and compel others, nor did we see that the Lord wants us to hate.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
