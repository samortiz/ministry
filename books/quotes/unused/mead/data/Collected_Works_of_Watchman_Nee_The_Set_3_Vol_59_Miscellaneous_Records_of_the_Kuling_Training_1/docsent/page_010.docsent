   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fulfilling the Ministry of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the ministry of the word?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peter said, "But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word" Acts 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peter's words indicate that everyone has a ministry, and that the apostles were committed to fulfill the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The phrase the ministry of the word in Greek is diakonia tou logou.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means a service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A ministry is a service; it means to wait on others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should serve men with words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ministry of the word is to serve men, to attend to their needs, with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A minister of the word first must have the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he does not have the word, he cannot fulfill his ministry or attend to others' needs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can one attend to others' needs by fulfilling the ministry of the word?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When a man has the ministry of the word, he receives a revelation and a burden in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is clear within about the Lord's will, the Lord's commission, and the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knows how to release this word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the books of the prophets in the Old Testament, the word inspiration should be translated as "the burden of the word."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, once a person has a burden, he has inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without a burden, there cannot be any inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A minister of the word first must have a burden for the word before he can step onto the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not hard for a man to have a burden, but whether or not his outer man is broken is altogether a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes a man has a definite burden and sense from the Lord, but his outer man cannot furnish him with the proper utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This happens to those whose outer man is not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those whose outer man is not broken cannot speak to relieve their burden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes, their burden becomes heavier by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a man is broken, his inner man will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes a person stands on the podium and goes around in circles in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is bound by his burden; he cannot release or discharge it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The burden inside his spirit cannot break through his outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Outwardly he may be preaching, but inwardly his burden is still within his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His mind is not under his control, and he cannot discharge his inner burden through his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He may speak for two hours, tiring out the audience as well as himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He may use many words, but his spirit is not released.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He comes to the meeting with a burden, and he returns home with the same burden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The load on his shoulder remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If part of our outer man, the mind, is not broken, we will be useless to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not saying that we should not exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am saying that the mind and the soul have to be servants to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The soul must be dealt with and smitten before it can become useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only then is our mind no longer its own master but an instrument of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A minister of the word must not only have a burden and a word from the Lord; his mind must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If his mind has been dealt with, he can listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is not independent, and he can easily convey the burden of his spirit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the word is released this way, the burden is released.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One must not be satisfied simply with others' approval of his speaking; he must have the sense that he has spoken the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If he speaks in this way, his burden will be discharged as soon as he finishes speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The audience will be satisfied, and he will be satisfied as well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The two worst conditions facing a minister of the word are: 1 Having thoughts but not being able to release the spirit in his ministry, that is, the spirit is not exercised, and 2 having the spirit and the exercise of the spirit in the ministry, but not having the proper thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both cases speak of a conflict between the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In neither case is there a proper ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first kind of ministers are heady and full of thoughts; they are blind in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The second kind of ministers have a burden in their spirit, but they do not have the words to release them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Their outer man and inner man are in conflict with one another; they are not in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only a broken man can fulfill the ministry of the word and release his spirit quickly without going around in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As soon as his spirit is released, it touches others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a man does not have an inward burden, he cannot fulfill the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If he has a burden but his outward thoughts do not cooperate with him, he cannot fulfill the ministry of the word either.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only those whose outer man has been smitten and broken by God can be proper ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The ministry of the word means a ministry that discharges one's inward burden.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Conditions after the Breaking of the Outer Man The Will Being Pliable yet Strong</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After a man experiences the breaking of his outer shell, several things happen.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First, the will becomes pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The will occupies a great part of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once the outer man is broken, the person, the will, becomes softened.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before a man's shell is broken, he is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those with an uncracked shell have a will that is hard but not powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A broken man, however, is a softened man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His will is strong but not hard.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His will is like a tire which is strong but not hard.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who want help find that it is easy to approach such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Such a person sees light easily.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is easy to approach such a person, and it is easy for him to approach others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those whose outer man is broken and whose will is made pliable are very approachable for help, and it is also easy for them to receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They know men, and they are easy to get along with.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is easy for them to release their spirit and easy for them to receive God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can talk to some people for two hours and yet still be in the dark about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We can talk with others for two minutes and all of our problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Those whose outer man is not broken have a hardened will.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They like to argue, and they become quite rigid in their mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is not easy for them to receive light or teaching from God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The first thing that happens with the breaking of the outer man is a softening of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is not a mere form of politeness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Such softening is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The kind of softening that is manifested in a broken man is very spontaneous.</S>
