<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Escaping from His Uncle Laban</H2><P>Jacob escaped from his uncle Laban according to the indication of the complaint of Laban's sons and the attitude of Laban and according to God's instruction (31:1-21). Jacob stayed with Laban and worked for Laban for twenty years, and within this time Laban changed Jacob's wages ten times (v. 41). The first fourteen years of his labor were his service to Laban so that he could gain Leah and Rachel as his wives. Jacob loved Rachel and told Laban that he would serve him seven years for her. Laban agreed to this, but when these seven years were completed, Laban tricked him and gave him Leah. Then he told Jacob that he would give him Rachel for another seven years of his service. Jacob agreed and Laban then gave him his daughter Rachel (29:18-28). Jacob served Laban for a total of twenty years. Although Laban was so subtle and even changed Jacob's wages ten times, Jacob was eventually the winner. He came to Laban's house as a young bachelor, but he left Laban's house with four wives, eleven sons, and many herds of cattle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Facing the Trouble of Laban's<br>Pursuing and Overtaking Him</H2><P>Jacob faced the trouble of Laban's pursuing and overtaking him while he was under the secret care and protection of God as the Angel of God&#151;Christ (31:10-13, 22-55). Laban was not an easygoing person. Jacob with his four wives did not say goodbye to him when they left. They stole away and fled from Laban (v. 20). When Laban realized this, he took his men to pursue them and he eventually overtook them. Laban rebuked Jacob, but Jacob in turn rebuked Laban more strongly. That subdued Laban (vv. 25-44). Eventually, he and Laban made a covenant of peace with each other. Then Laban kissed his daughters and grandchildren, blessed them, and returned to his place (v. 55). This account is a good example of human diplomacy.</P><P>Actually, though, Jacob faced the trouble from Laban while he was under the secret care of God as the Angel of God&#151;Christ. The first time we see Christ as the Angel of Jehovah to serve God's people is in the book of Exodus. Exodus 3:2 says that the Angel of Jehovah appeared to Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. Exodus 14 shows that when Pharaoh's army came to overtake Israel, Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was going before them and was also taking care of them from behind to protect them (v. 19). Jacob was under the secret care of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah.</P><P>After Laban departed from Jacob, Genesis 32:1 and 2 say that "Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim." Mahanaim means two hosts, two camps, two armies. As Jacob was on his way, he was probably thinking about how he would face Esau. Much to his surprise, two hosts of the angels of God met him, indicating that they would protect him. Afterward, Jacob divided his family into two camps, two armies (v. 7). Jacob was under God's protection because his preservation was vital to God's New Testament economy. Out of Jacob eventually came Mary, of whom Christ was born (Matt. 1:2, 16).</P>
