   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Olive Oil</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible olive oil signifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Olive oil is produced by the pressing of olives.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The olive oil signifies the Spirit of God, through the pressure of Christ s death, flowing out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The olive oil is the base of the ointment; it is the basic element compounded with the spices.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The four spices are compounded into the olive oil to make the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the Spirit of God, signified by the olive oil, is no longer merely oil, but now it is oil compounded with certain ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regarding this, John 7:39 says, But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that before the Lord s glorification, the compound Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was after Christ s resurrection that the compounding, or the blending, of such a Spirit was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Four Spices</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Signifying Humanity in God s Creation,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>and the Oil Signifying Divinity in the Godhead</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The four spices signify humanity in God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible the number four signifies God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have the four living creatures and the four corners of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, the four spices themselves are elements of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These spices signify the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His incarnation the Lord Jesus was both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The four spices signify the humanity of the Lord Jesus in God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, some Christians do not like to hear the word creation used in the case of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is due to the heretical teaching of Arius who taught that Christ was merely a created being, and that He was not the eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The oil signifies divinity in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen that the number four signifies the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number one signifies God, the unique Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this compound ointment we have the numbers four and one, with the number four blended with the number one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This signifies humanity blended, mingled, with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning the compound ointment, we cannot avoid using the word mingled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The words compounded and blended actually mean mingled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The four spices were mingled with the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The mingling of the spices with the oil can be compared to the mingling of fine flour and oil in the meal offering Lev 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the meal offering, the dough is produced by blending, mingling, fine flour with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This also signifies that in the one Person of Christ we have both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have read some books which say that the Gospel of John was written in an attempt to reconcile the different parties who were debating concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some said that Christ was God, and others that He was merely a man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Others said that Christ was not God, but was the Word, the Logos, created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This makes it clear that the Word, which is Christ, is God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, John 1:14 says, The Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The very Word who is God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, I do not like to use the words conciliate or reconcile with respect to John s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The writings of the apostle John actually are not conciliatory; rather, they are all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If He were only God and not man, or were merely man and not God, He would not be all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord that Christ is God as well as man, man as well as God!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because Christ is all-inclusive, the writings of John are also all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The compound ointment likewise is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Can you see the all-inclusiveness of this compound?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this all-inclusive compound we have olive oil, myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This indicates that in the compound Spirit typified by the ointment we can see divinity, humanity, the all-inclusive death of Christ, and the effectiveness of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, we can see the precious resurrection of Christ and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these elements are included in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As used in the New Testament, the Spirit of Christ is an all-inclusive expression.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, there is no reference to the bountiful supply of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Genesis 1 we read about the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But in the Epistles of Paul we have the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of Jesus Christ as well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May we all be deeply impressed that today the all-inclusive Spirit, as the compound ointment, is nothing less than the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive Spirit to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some Christians consider this understanding of the Spirit heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the judgment made today is not final.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to the Bible, this is the day of man, and man s day is not final.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let us wait until the day of the Lord, and let Him judge.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have the assurance that the Lord will say that this understanding of the all-inclusive Spirit is right.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Old Testament we have the olive oil signifying the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, after the tabernacle was built up and the priests were made ready, there was not only the olive oil, but the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This indicates that we have not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No doubt, Mr. C. A. Coates has seen something here.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In his writing on the ointment in Exodus 30 he speaks of the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of another Man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As believers, we have been anointed with the compound ointment, with the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Psalm 133:2 describes how the anointing oil flowed down from Aaron s head to his beard and then to the skirts of his garments.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This signifies that the whole Body is anointed with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then in 1 John 2:20 and 27 we are told that we have received an anointing and that this anointing teaches us all things.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>First John 2:20 says, And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 27 says, The anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To receive the anointing is to receive the divine painting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Painters know that it is good to apply more than one coat of paint.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In painting certain things it is good to have layer upon layer of paint.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In our experience of the Spirit, we need to be painted again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Eventually, we may receive hundreds of layers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Praise the Lord that He is daily painting us by His anointing!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As the anointing is being applied to us, it teaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today God mainly teaches us silently by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For example, you may ask the Lord about something, and He will teach you concerning it by anointing you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we would say, Lord, please tell me what color You want, the Lord may not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Instead, He may pick up His brush and paint you a particular color, perhaps green.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead of speaking to you about the color green, He tells you that He wants green by painting you green.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is the Lord s way to teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>According to 1 John 2, the anointing within us teaches us in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Many times we know that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>No one needs to tell us this.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But the moving of the anointing within us teaches us that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I believe that we all have had some amount of experience of this teaching of the anointing.</S>
