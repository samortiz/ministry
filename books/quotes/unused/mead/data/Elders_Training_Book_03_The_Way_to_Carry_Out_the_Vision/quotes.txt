[1]  Elders' Training Book 03, The Way to Carry Out the Vision CONTENTS
[2]  The Need to Acquire the Crucial Points of the Truth and a Bird s-eye View of the Scriptures
[3]  Book one presents the essential aspects of the ministry of the New Testament; book two sets forth the vision of the Lord s recovery; book three covers the way to carry out the vision; and book four emphasizes other crucial matters concerning the practice of the Lord s recovery.
[4]  Those of us that were in these meetings were deeply convicted of our need to be further enlightened by the Lord concerning God s economy and concerning the intrinsic essence of the New Testament ministry which is for the carrying out of this divine economy.
[5]  If you read the Chinese Bible, you must understand the Chinese language; if you read the English Bible, you must understand the English language; and if you are trying to read the Greek Bible you must understand the Greek language.
[6]  I hope you would also give me the freedom and the mercy to say something frankly and honestly to you all.
[7]  Since I have been in America over twenty-two years, I have noticed that most of the Chinese are far inferior in speaking in comparison to the Americans because of the different educational principles in their cultures.
[8]  When I was listening to the testimonies in the meetings concerning the Life-study of the Bible, I noticed that the American saints are very smart in picking up funny thoughts many times, but they neglect the crucial points.
[9]  For the last ten years, however, many of you have been sitting under a kind of speaking which is awkward and repetitious, but when you go home you have the realization that an injection got into you which heals and nourishes you.
[10]  Second, after picking up the crucial points, we must put these points together.
[11]  In order to have a bird s-eye view over a message, a chapter, or over a portion of the Word, we must learn how to put the points together to make a section.
[12]  For example, there may be twenty-five points in a certain chapter of the Bible, but you must learn how to section this chapter.
[13]  CHAPTER TWO A BIRD S-EYE VIEW OF MARK AND ROMANS
[14]  The best way to become impressed with a book of the Bible and to keep this book in your memory is to keep the bird s-eye view of this book.
[15]  In this chapter, we will look at the bird s-eye view of the book of Mark and of the book of Romans.
[16]  I must honestly tell you that in my whole Christian life I never loved the book of Mark until I was forced to write the notes on this book for the winter training of 1983.
[17]  Before preparing for the winter training of 1983, the only thing that I could tell you about the outline of the Gospel of Mark is that in the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, John the Baptist came out 1:1-4 , and at the end the disciples went out to preach the gospel to all the creation 16:15, 20 .
[18]  The bird s-eye view of the book of Romans is mainly of four stations.
[19]  If you have such a bird s-eye view of these four stations you can see that the book of Romans shows us the fallen condition of a sinner who is going to be made a son of God that he can be an organic member of the Body of Christ which is expressed in the local churches.
[20]  CHAPTER THREE NOT BECOMING CONTENTED A LESSON FROM CHURCH HISTORY
[21]  Based upon what we have picked up by the crucial points and by the bird s-eye view over an entire book and even over the entire Bible, we must learn how to go further based upon what we have read and studied.
[22]  Church history shows us that throughout the centuries many Bible readers and teachers became contented once they got something really good from the Bible.
[23]  You may know all the crucial points in these books and you may even have a bird s-eye view of the entire Bible.
[24]  At this point you may have the attitude that you know the Bible and, thus, you would not go any further.
[25]  Even after I opened up some portions of the Word, I studied them further.
[26]  I would like to illustrate to you what I mean by sharing with you what I have seen from a further study of Isaiah 9:6.
[27]  Many of you know that I have been speaking on this verse for over twenty years in America.
[28]  I did some further study on this verse and I believe that I have seen a better way to present it.
[29]  Now we want to see something further concerning 2 Corinthians 3:17.
[30]  They say that the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17 does not refer to Jesus Christ, but that it is a general address referring to God.
[31]  In the opening word of this Epistle, however, Paul did not write in a way that we would think to be so serious: Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently 1:3 .
[32]  Please do not have the peace and assurance that as long as you teach things scripturally that it is alright.
[33]  They brought the Bible, the gospel, and the Lord s name to China, and they brought a substantial number of God s chosen ones into the salvation of Christ.
[34]  In the earlier chapters, we have seen what the New Testament ministry is and what the vision in the Lord s recovery is.
[35]  If you mean business with the Lord and if you love the Lord for His recovery and you love His recovery for the Lord you must get yourself constituted with this New Testament ministry.
[36]  Some condemn us and slander us by saying that we take the Life-study messages more than the Bible and even as the Bible because we use them so much.
[37]  We must ask, though, which students of the Bible and which teachers of the Bible have never used commentaries, expositions, or other books.
[38]  Commentaries and expositions are not for the purpose of replacing the Bible but for the purpose of opening up the Bible, which is somewhat hard for us to enter in. Because we need the help of reference books, this does not mean that we replace the Bible with reference books.
[39]  Those of us who have read the Life-study messages can testify that these Life-studies with the Recovery Version and all the footnotes open the Bible to us whenever we touch them.
[40]  We must see that the processed Triune God is dispensing Himself into His redeemed, tripartite man, making this man a man of life first his spirit is life v. 10 , then his mind becomes life v. 6 , and finally, life is given to his mortal body v. 11 . Until you have seen such a vision you could never enter into Romans 8.
[41]  If you read the book of Romans by yourself without any help, I am afraid that you will not see that this book ends with the local churches and that the revelation in this book intends to bring you from a sinner to a son of God and a member of Christ to the local churches.
[42]  Temporarily, I felt that this was right, but eventually I discovered that this interpretation does not fit with the children of Israel being a type of God s people in God s economy.
[43]  From the Reformation to the present time many different truths have been recovered in the Lord s recovery.
[44]  These things, however, should not be separated from Christ and the church v. 32 . The woman s submission and the man s love are taught in the Bible with Christ for the church.
[45]  Another principle which we must take in our interpretation of the Bible is the principle of four items: Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.
[46]  The first principle we have seen is a general principle the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people.
[47]  Now we see a third principle of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.
[48]  Any message or any development of the Bible without Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church is an empty shell with no content.
[49]  However, many of these people turned to the way of the Lord s recovery to pick up Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.
[50]  If you compare Moody s messages to the other evangelists messages of his day, you can see that with Moody s messages there is some solid content, while with the others you can see mostly eloquence.
[51]  Even if you have a good portion of the Word with a good idea to stir up people s interest, you must consider whether or not Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church are the content of your message.
[52]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE DIVINE TRINITY 1 THE ESSENTIAL TRINITY
[53]  Thus far, the two main aspects we have seen concerning the divine Trinity are the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity.
[54]  In the essential Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and coinhere at the same time and in the same way with no succession.
[55]  In the work of the Father s plan we can say that the Father did the works in the Son and with the Spirit, but we cannot say that the Son did that work with the Father and by the Spirit.
[56]  Now we need to go on to see the difference between the Triune God and the divine Trinity.
[57]  It is more correct to refer the divine dispensing to the divine Trinity rather than to the Triune God.
[58]  The New Testament reveals that the Father is in us, the Son is in us, the Spirit is in us, and God is in us.
[59]  Through our fellowship in this training I want to assure you that there is no need to be doubtful concerning what you have received through this ministry concerning the Lord s recovery today.
[60]  In the history of theological study concerning the divine Trinity, three words have been used essence, hypostasis, and substance.
[61]  We need to clarify the meaning of these three words, which we have already mentioned in relation to the divine Trinity.
[62]  In the first step there was the need to exercise foreknowledge.
[63]  Second, God selected persons according to His foreknowledge, and third, He predestinated or marked out His chosen people.
[64]  This does not mean, however, that when the Father did these three things, the Son was not there or the Spirit was not there.
[65]  According to the entire revelation of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Trinity of the Godhead is for God s dispensing.
[66]  God s desire with His strong intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people as their life, as their life supply, and as their everything.
[67]  God chose us, God predestinated us, God created us, God became flesh, God accomplished redemption and redeemed us, God regenerated us, God sanctified us, and God is doing everything in us, through us, and for us.
[68]  In the Bible we cannot see the church of the Father or the church of the Spirit, but the church of Christ and the church of God.
[69]  CHAPTER NINE BRINGING THE SAINTS INTO THE TRUTH 1 GETTING INTO THE MINISTRY
[70]  Thus far, we have seen that to carry out this New Testament ministry we must first get into this ministry.
[71]  After getting into it, we must have some proper way or the best way to help the saints in the recovery to get solidly educated in this New Testament ministry.
[72]  I believe that when all the saints in the recovery have received the proper education they will spontaneously become good ministers to carry such a ministry to the outsiders, to the unbelievers, and to the other Christians who do not meet with us.
[73]  I feel that it is crucial for us to find out what the best way is to help the saints in each local church to get into the same things which we ourselves have gotten into.
[74]  A number of the saints have been meeting with us for years and years, but they still have not gotten into the basic intrinsic element of the Lord s recovery.
[75]  I believe that we all have to admit that a good number of saints have been meeting with us year after year, yet if you check with them today, you would discover that not much intrinsic element of the divine revelation has been really wrought and constituted into their being.
[76]  In 1974 I began to write the notes for the Recovery Version of the Bible.
[77]  I do not believe you can find as many basic truths in other books as you have found in the Recovery Version.
[78]  In order to get the benefit of these four purposes in full you must dive into the Recovery Version with the footnotes and the Life-study messages.
[79]  We hope that the leading ones, either the elders or the ones who are taking care of any meeting such as the Chinese speaking meetings, the Spanish speaking meetings, and the young people s meetings, would pick up a burden and look to the Lord for a desire that all the saints would get into this New Testament ministry.
[80]  Some of you may be concerned as to how you could do this.
[81]  I do not mean that you do not know anything, but you must realize that, even humanly speaking, a short period of study does not qualify a person to get a job having to do with the exploration of space in the space center in Houston.
[82]  CHAPTER TEN BRINGING THE SAINTS INTO THE TRUTH 2 THE NEED OF THE TRUTH
[83]  History has clearly shown us that the existence of a denomination, free group, or the genuine church life all depends on the doctrines.
[84]  Since the Lord s recovery has come to the United States, we have stressed very much that the building up of the church depends upon the experience of Christ, upon the life-giving Spirit, and upon the matters of life.
[85]  I say this to show you that even in the past I occasionally indicated strongly that the so-called Spirit cannot build up the church, but the solid truth or the solid doctrines can.
[86]  The Lord s recovery is just for the recovery of the processed Triune God to be dispensed into us, and the living Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church are the crucial contents of the Lord s recovery.
[87]  I believe that those of you who have read the Life-study messages can testify honestly that these messages with the notes of the Recovery Version have opened up a certain chapter or a certain book of the Bible to you.
[88]  Based upon this, I feel that for the long range for the Lord s recovery in such a top country as the United States, which is full of culture, education, scientific knowledge, and biblical knowledge, the greatest need we must meet is to bring the saints in the Lord s recovery into the truth to carry the Lord s recovery on.
[89]  We need to find a way to bring all the saints in the Lord s recovery into a proper education of the truth concerning God s New Testament economy.
[90]  We should help the saints to build up a practice or a habit that every day they would spend a least thirty minutes in the Word.
[91]  We all need to build up such a practice to spend at least thirty minutes a day to get into God s Word.
[92]  In this chapter we will continue our fellowship on how to bring the saints in our locality into the truth so that they will get a solid foundation in the Word.
[93]  Each saint must have a proper, daily, regular diet of a few verses in the Bible with the notes of the Recovery Version accompanied by the Life-study messages.
[94]  Some of the elders may think that this is not easy.
[95]  In principle I hope that you would take my word to help the saints in their personal time to get into the Word and also to bring the church meeting into such a living way and, even more, a rich way.
[96]  If the elders and all the seeking ones come to the meeting without this kind of preparation beforehand, they are leaving the entire meeting to fortune.
[97]  If you come to the meeting without being prepared you may offer a two second prayer such as, Lord, have mercy upon us and enrich the meeting, Lord.
[98]  When you see that nothing good is coming out in the meeting, by that time you will have nothing to minister.
[99]  LIVING IN THE SPIRIT AND SPEAKING IN THE SPIRIT
[100]  We also must remember that whenever we speak in the meeting, we should speak in the Spirit.
[101]  Today we are in the New Testament age, but even David in the Old Testament age spoke in the Spirit 2 Sam 23:2 .
[102]  Therefore, when you go back to your locality, you must call a meeting, not of all the saints, but at least of all the serving ones who have a heart for the Lord s recovery, to have some fellowship with them to consider and to reconsider the situation.
[103]  Concerning the use of the Life-study messages in the church meetings, the elders in each locality need to seek the Lord s leading as to which book of the New Testament is most helpful to the church at the present time.
[104]  Instead of making this decision by themselves, the elders should fellowship with those who are interested in bearing responsibility, not only of the church in their locality but also of the Lord s recovery.
[105]  Just as people have different tastes in food, so the Lord s recovery also has a taste for the ministry that has built up the recovery over the years.
[106]  This means that if you speak something contrary to the taste of the Lord s recovery, your speaking will be rejected, and you will be the first to suffer loss.
[107]  Just as parents will have trouble with their children if they force them to eat food that is contrary to their taste, so you will have trouble if you expect the saints to eat something against the taste in the Lord s recovery.
[108]  Whether or not a particular ministry is part of the New Testament ministry can be proved by applying three governing principles: one, the principle of the processed Triune God being dispensed into His chosen people; second, the principle of Christ and the church; and third, the principle of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.
[109]  If a brother is to be an adequate elder, or even an adequate leader in any church meeting, he needs to have the adequate knowledge of the truth.
[110]  Anyone who does not have this knowledge of the truth cannot take care of the church, God s flock, in a proper way.
[111]  If you would be a leader in the church caring for the flock, and if you would keep spiritual germs away from the church life, you must have an adequate knowledge of the New Testament truths.
[112]  As a help to gaining the full knowledge of the basic truths, I would encourage you to go through the entire New Testament using the Recovery Version with the notes and the Life-studies.
[113]  I may realize that the appointment of a particular brother as an elder is not a divine appointment, but as I consider the situation I also realize that there is no way to do anything about it.
[114]  In this chapter I would like to say something further concerning our experiences from the past years until today.
[115]  As far as the attendants of his meetings were concerned, his messages were good for inspiration and the ministry of life to help the saints to grow in life, but the saints did not have the view of being built up in the truth so they could continue to present the same truths to the needy ones.
[116]  I am very happy about these annual trainings because many truths were not put out according to inspiration, but according to the books of the Bible.
[117]  They do not, however, serve the purpose of educating the saints or building up the saints in the full knowledge of the truth.
[118]  To study our way through the books of the Bible, however, does not allow us to pick up our burden to put out something in the way of inspiration.
[119]  I must truthfully testify that if I had not been writing the notes on the books of the Bible, I would never have had an inspiration to give messages on the book of Mark.
[120]  I am not fellowshipping in a legal way, but in principle I beg the elders to reconsider the way to carry out the meetings.
[121]  I believe that the textbook entitled God s Full Salvation will be useful not only for the summer school with the junior high and high school students but also for a weekly church training.
[122]  The Lord s Day morning is the time for us to come together around the Lord s Word for the preaching of the gospel, the teaching of the truth, or for the ministry of life.
