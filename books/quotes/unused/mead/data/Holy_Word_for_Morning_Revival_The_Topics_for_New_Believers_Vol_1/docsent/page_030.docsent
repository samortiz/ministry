   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 5 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matt 5:23-24 If you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, first go and be reconciled to your brother</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 John 1:7 But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Basis of Dealing with Sins</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our object in dealing with sins includes all the sins we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In carrying it out, however, God does not require us to deal with all the sins at once, but to deal with all those that we are conscious of while in fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not mean to say that we must deal with all the sins that we have actually committed, but only with those we are conscious of while in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The basis, therefore, of dealing with sins is the consciousness we have while in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We read in the Scripture concerning this in Matthew 5:23 and 1 John 1:7.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Offering the gift Matt 5:23 is for fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore this means that when we are having fellowship with God and are conscious of any discord between ourselves and others, or vice versa, we should immediately endeavor to rectify this situation lest our fellowship with God be affected or hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First John 1:7 indicates that if we have fellowship with God, we can see our sins in His light; then, according to what we have seen in His light, we are to confess this to God and deal with it before God in order to obtain God's forgiveness and cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew 5 speaks of our problems with others, 1 John 1 about our problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both indicate our consciousness while in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our dealing with sins is based only on the consciousness while in fellowship with God, not on all the facts of all the sins we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the realm of the basis is much smaller than the realm of the object.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are aware of only ten percent, we deal with ten percent; if we are aware of twenty percent, we deal with twenty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, we deal only with the number of sins which we remember.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Practically speaking, dealing with sins is not an ordinance of the law, but a requirement of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are not conscious of the sins which we have committed, we do not need to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If however, we are aware of them, we should deal with them quickly; otherwise, our conscience will accuse us, our faith will become shipwrecked, and all spiritual things will thereby leak out 1 Tim 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The consciousness of fellowship upon which we base our dealing with sins is not absolute, but differs according to the degree of depth of fellowship the individual has with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the degree of our fellowship is deep, our consciousness will be keen and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If, on the other hand, the degree of our fellowship is shallow, our consciousness will be dull and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, we should never measure others by the yardstick of our consciousness, nor should we accept the consciousness of others as a yardstick by which to measure ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone should learn to deal with sins only according to his own consciousness at the time he is in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Limit of Our Dealings with Sins</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The limit of our dealing with sins is similar to that of our clearance of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we deal with sins, we should do it until we have life and peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we follow our consciousness in dealing with sins, we will feel inwardly satisfied, strengthened, refreshed, and quickened; we will also feel joyful, restful, comfortable, and secure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our spirit will be strong and living, and our fellowship with the Lord will be free and without hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our prayers will be releasing and with authority, and our utterance will be bold and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All these senses and experiences are the conditions of life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the limit of our dealing with sins, and this also is the result of our dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>103</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
