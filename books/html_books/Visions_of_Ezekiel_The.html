</div><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A WORD OF INTRODUCTION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:1-3; Num. 4:2-3; 1 Chron. 23:3a; Luke 3:23a; Ezek. 40:17; 41:6a; 46:22; Num. 8:24; Gen. 11:1-9, 31</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PURPOSE</H2><P>Before we get into Ezekiel, we need to consider the picture revealed in Genesis 1 through 3. In these three chapters, God created man and placed him before the tree of life. The tree of life signifies God Himself as life to us in the form of food. Due to the fall of man, the tree of life was concealed and encompassed by the cherubim. Not only was it encompassed and concealed, but also the flaming sword came to bar the way to the tree of life. But through the redemption of Christ, man gained access to the tree of life again, to take the tree of life as his food. This is why the Lord Jesus told us in John 6 that He came as the bread of life, and that we should take Him as our food. He said, "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me" (John 6:57). We can take Him as our food. Then we will have His life and His nature, and eventually we will bear His image. By having His life, His nature, and His image, we all will be built up together. In John 17:21, the Lord Jesus prayed, "That they all may be one." What did the Lord mean? He simply meant that we all must be built up together. If we go then from John's Gospel to John's Revelation, we can see that all the redeemed ones are built up together into one city. In that city, we are all one, not just in word or in doctrine, but in building. We must be built up with one another in life. Then God will have a city, the New Jerusalem.</P><P>The book of Ezekiel unveils to us the very same thing. In the first chapter are the cherubim of flaming fire with God in their midst. Other chapters show us how that God comes to be our life (Ezek. 11, 33, 34, 36, 37, 47). Eventually, chapter forty-eight tells us that we who have His life will all be built up together into the holy city, Jerusalem. Thus, we can see that Ezekiel is a miniature of the whole Bible. The Bible shows us clearly that God's eternal purpose and intention is to dispense Himself into us that we may have Him as our life and that we may have His very nature. By receiving His divine nature, we are enabled to bear His glorious image. Eventually, we will be mingled together with God as one entity with two natures. Then we will be built up together as God's eternal dwelling place. This is God's eternal purpose as clearly revealed in the Scriptures. We must remember that both the Bible and the book of Ezekiel reveal that God's intention is just to dispense Himself into us as our life so that we may have His divine nature and that we may bear His glorious image. Then, by the divine nature with the divine image, we all will be built up together as one eternal dwelling place&#151;the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PARALLEL TO REVELATION</H2><P>Ezekiel and Revelation have very much in common. In fact, the main points in these two books are nearly the same. Ezekiel and John the Apostle both saw visions, and the two books both begin with the visions which they saw. In both, the visions are related mainly to life. Without these two books, we may realize that the Bible tells us about life, but it would be difficult for us to understand clearly what life is. These two books not only have the term life, but also have visions portraying what life is and how life is working within us and among us. By these visions, we can actually see something of life. The messages in this book are not interpretations of the prophetical aspect of these visions, but applications of their spiritual significance according to life.</P><P>Both of these books show us the flow of the river of living water. In Ezekiel 47, the river flows out of the habitation of God. Also, in Revelation 22, a river of living water proceeds out of the throne of God and the Lamb. Thus, in both Ezekiel and Revelation, a river flows out of God with a life supply. Both books also show us a vision of Jerusalem. Ezekiel ends with a vision of Jerusalem and so does Revelation. Furthermore, both of these books tell us how God's intention is to come into us to be our life, that we may have His divine nature and His glorious image. Then, in His divine nature with His glorious image, having Him as our life, we may be built up together as the Holy City to be God's dwelling place for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FOUR SECTIONS OF EZEKIEL</H2><P>Ezekiel is a book of visions. The first section of Ezekiel, which is all of chapter one, presents a vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord. It reveals how God is manifested, how God moves, and how God administrates His government through the four living creatures. Through their coordination, God is able to move and administrate. In the second section, from chapter two through chapter thirty-two, God comes as the consuming fire to judge His people and the heathen nations. After the judgment, God comes in to recover His people by life. The third section, that of recovery, begins in chapter thirty-three and continues through chapter thirty-nine. The fourth section, concerning the holy building of God, comes out of the recovery by life and consummates the whole book. Thus, Ezekiel begins with the appearance of the glory of the Lord and ends with the holy building of God. This indicates that God's goal and purpose is the building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INTRODUCTION TO EZEKIEL</H2><P>Now we come to the first three verses in the book of Ezekiel. These verses are an introduction which open the content of the book to us. They are a very special, specific, and extraordinary introduction. Every one of the sixty-six books of the Bible begins in a unique way. For instance, Genesis begins in this way: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Matthew begins in this way: "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham." The Gospel of John begins in this way: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Ezekiel begins in a very peculiar, apparently meaningless, way. Let us read these three verses: "Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity, the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him." What is the meaning of these verses? What is the meaning of the thirtieth year? of the fourth month? of the fifth day of the month? Apparently, these three verses have little meaning; yet actually they are very significant. In these three short verses of introduction, four main things are covered. This is a book of visions, and these three verses first show us the year, the month, and the day that Ezekiel saw the visions. Second, these verses also show us the place where he saw the visions. Third, they show us the man, the person, who saw the visions. Fourth, they indicate to us the conditions, the situations, at the time of the vision. Thus, this short introduction shows us the date, the place, the person, and the conditions at the time of the visions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DATE OF THE VISIONS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Thirtieth Year</H2><P>Let us now consider these four points in more detail. First is the date, with the year, the month, and the day. The year was the thirtieth year. It is really difficult to understand the meaning of the thirtieth year. If we study the whole of Scripture, though, we can be clear that the thirtieth year means the thirtieth year of Ezekiel's life. At that time, Ezekiel was thirty years of age. According to Numbers 4:2-3 and 1 Chronicles 23:3, a priest, a Levite, started to serve the Lord when he was thirty. The Lord Jesus also started to serve God in His ministry when He was thirty. As a priest having reached the age of thirty, Ezekiel was qualified to start his priestly ministry. Here we discover a principle: to realize spiritual things and to see heavenly visions, we need the maturity of life. The age of thirty signifies the maturity of life. By the age of thirty, all the priests were mature. By this age, Ezekiel was mature. By this age, the Lord Jesus Christ was also mature. This indicates to us that if we would see the visions in this book, we need a certain measure of maturity in our spiritual life. Christians today have difficulty understanding this book because most of them are so young in life. Spiritually, some may be only five years of age. Others may be twelve years of age and others even fifteen years of age, but not many have reached the age of thirty in spiritual maturity. It is difficult for a childish Christian to understand the visions in this book. The one who saw these visions was full of maturity. He had reached the age of thirty. The number thirty is also used in Ezekiel 40 through 48, the portion regarding God's building. The outer court of God's temple in 46:22 has four corner courts, each of which has a breadth of thirty cubits. These four corner courts are the places for the priests to prepare the offerings for the people to eat and enjoy. Furthermore, in 40:17, the outer court of the temple has thirty chambers. When the people come together to worship God, they enjoy the rich offerings in these thirty chambers. Ezekiel 41:6 mentions another thirty side chambers. These are around the temple on three sides, in each of the three stories. In every story there are thirty side chambers. All these side chambers indicate the fullness of the temple.</P><P>By putting all these verses together, we can understand the meaning of these things. We can see that the number thirty is a number related to preparing Christ, ministering Christ to others, enjoying the riches of Christ, and expressing the fullness of Christ. What is the meaning of the number thirty in the Bible? It signifies the maturity of life; it signifies the ability to prepare Christ for others to enjoy and for you to enjoy; and it indicates the capacity to express Christ in all His fullness. When Ezekiel saw the visions, he was thirty years of age, and this means that he was a mature person. He was able to prepare Christ and minister Christ for others to enjoy. He was also mature and able to enjoy all the riches of Christ in all His fullness. The number thirty is not only for Ezekiel, but also for us. We must be mature in our spiritual life so that we can see the visions concerning Christ and His Body. Then, we can prepare food for others' enjoyment, and we ourselves can enjoy all the riches of Christ and become the side chambers of the temple, the fullness of Christ.</P><P>The number thirty is constituted in two ways in Ezekiel. It is constituted of five multiplied by six and also of three times ten. Mainly, it is constituted of three times ten. The number ten in the Bible is always composed of two fives, not four plus six or three plus seven. In Matthew 25, there are ten virgins. Five virgins are wise and five are foolish. With the Ten Commandments, there are five commandments on one tablet and five commandments on another tablet. What is the meaning of the number five? Five signifies the responsibility that you can bear by having God added to you. Consider the four fingers plus one thumb. With these five fingers, you can bear the responsibility to do things. The number four is the number of the creature, and the number one is the number of the Creator. When the creature has the Creator added to him, he can bear responsibility. Thus, you can see that ten is composed of two times five, and this means that we are the creatures who have God added to us in order that we can bear responsibility. This responsibility is in three layers as shown in the following chapters. These three layers, or three stories, signify the three persons of the Godhead&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</P><P>Thus, the number thirty means that the creatures have the Triune God added to them so that they can bear responsibility. This is the maturity of life that we need to prepare Christ for others' enjoyment, to enjoy Christ in a full way for ourselves, and to express Christ in His fullness. Before we were regenerated, we were the creatures having only the number four. But one day we received God into us and became the number five. We all must have God added into us in the three Persons of the Triune God. By that addition, we can become the number thirty, full of maturity. We all need to be Ezekiels who are thirty years of age. As such, we can see the vision, we can prepare the offering for others' enjoyment, we can enjoy all the riches of the offerings for ourselves, and we can express Christ in a full way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fifth Year</H2><P>Ezekiel not only said that it was the thirtieth year, but he also said that it was the fifth year. The thirtieth year was counted from the year of his birth, but the fifth year was counted from the year of captivity. Five years had passed since they had gone into captivity. Remember that five means four plus one, signifying the Creator added to the creatures. Why did the visions come in the fifth year of the captivity and not in the first year or the second or the third? It was because the people were not ready until the fifth year. Ezekiel, being under the age of thirty, was not ready; likewise, the people also were not ready until they had been in captivity five years. One more point about the fifth year: five years before, Ezekiel was but twenty-five, not thirty. Numbers 4:2-3 tells us that all the priests began their ministry at the age of thirty. But Numbers 8:24 tells us that all the Levites started to serve at the age of twenty-five. Apparently there is a contradiction in the Bible. One chapter says they started to serve when they were twenty-five, and another chapter says they started to serve when they were thirty. What is the difference? This indicates they needed five years of apprenticeship. They could not come into the priestly service right away. They needed to be trained and disciplined for five years. At the beginning of the captivity, Ezekiel was an apprentice. He had just come into his apprenticeship. He was a learner. He did not see the visions at the beginning of his apprenticeship, but at the end of his apprenticeship, when he had fully matured. This means that to accept and receive the visions requires the maturity of life. For Ezekiel to see the visions, he needed the maturity of thirty years, and for the people to receive the visions, they needed five years to mature. This shows us that in spiritual things there is the need of maturity. You cannot see or receive spiritual things when you are young. We all must look to the Lord that He would grant us the maturity in life so that we may see the spiritual things, and that we may be able to accept, receive, and take in all the spiritual things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PLACE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In Chaldea</H2><P>Let us now consider the place where he saw the visions. The place was not a good place, but was the land of the Chaldeans. Chaldea was the place where Babel began. The name Babel in Hebrew is the same word as Babylon in Greek. Therefore, Chaldea was just Babylon. We know from Genesis 11 that Babel was the place Satan collected all the fallen people to rebel against God. That was the very place where Ezekiel saw the visions&#151;the place where Satan started a great rebellion against God among the fallen people. But hallelujah! That was also the place out of which God had called Abraham and His chosen people. Unfortunately, most of His chosen people had been carried back to that place as captives by Ezekiel's time. Their captivity was a kind of fall. They had fallen into the very place from which their forefather Abraham had been called out by God.</P><P>Let me ask you a question. Where is today's Christianity? Do you consider that today's Christianity is in the land of Canaan? Or is it in the land of the Chaldeans? What would you answer? Surely most Christians today are not in the good land, but are in the place of degradation. This is why the book of Ezekiel fits today's situation when so many Christians are not in the good land, but in the land of Chaldea.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By A River</H2><P>When Ezekiel received the visions, he was by a river. In this book, there are two rivers. One river is in chapter one, and the other is in chapter forty-seven. The river Chebar carried the people of God away from God, but the river flowing out of the temple brought people into God's life. Do you realize that today on this earth there are still these two rivers? One river is the trend, the course, the tide, of this world. This river from the fallen world carries people away from God. But hallelujah! There is also another river on this earth. Wherever this river flows, everything shall live.</P><P>By which river are you today? Are you by the river Chebar? Or are you by the river that flows out of the dwelling place of God? You may say that you are by the river of the living water which comes out of the dwelling place of God, but do you not still have something of the course of this age? Are you not yet in the trend of today's world? If you are still in the trend of today's world, you are not by the river of the living water, but by the river Chebar. You are not in the holy land of Canaan; you are in the land of the Chaldeans. Two rivers are flowing today. One is the river of this world, and the other is the river of the holy land. One is the river that carries people away from God, and the other is the river which brings people back to God. One is the river which destroys the building of God, and the other is the river which is for the building up of God's dwelling place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PERSON</H2><P>Now we need to consider the person who saw the vision. What kind of person was Ezekiel? First, he was a priest. A priest is one who lives in the presence of God, serving God and mingling himself with God. Ezekiel was such a priest. Second, Ezekiel was the son of Buzi. Buzi means contempt or despised. Ezekiel was a prophet despised by the people. In his ministry, he received no glory. If today in the Lord's recovery you are one of the Ezekiels, you will be despised. Do not think that you will have any glory. All the people will despise you. But though we may be despised by others, we should never be disappointed. We all must be Ezekiels. Do you know the meaning of the word Ezekiel? It means "God will strengthen" or the "Almighty One, your strength." No matter how much people despise you, you must be strengthened. Furthermore, the Lord told Ezekiel that He would make his face stronger than their faces and his forehead stronger than theirs. His forehead would be like adamant, like a diamond, like a flint, so hard. He was despised by people, but he was strengthened by God (3:8-9). The name Ezekiel ends with the suffix el. What does el mean? It means the "Almighty One." On one hand, he was the son of Buzi, despised by others, but on the other hand, he was Ezekiel, strengthened by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONDITIONS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Heavens Being Opened</H2><P>Now we need to see the conditions for seeing the visions. First, the heavens were opened. Whenever people on this earth are one with God, the heavens will be opened to them. The first time that the Bible mentions the heavens being opened was when Jacob was wandering in his attempt to escape from his brother, Esau. That night he had a dream, and in the dream the heavens were opened to him (Gen. 28:11-17). What did this signify? It signified that God was going to gain that naughty Jacob as His beachhead on earth. Then the heavens could be opened to the earth. When the Lord Jesus was baptized, the heavens were opened to declare that there was a man on the earth who was one with God in the heavens (Matt. 3:16-17). In the land of captivity, there was also a man, Ezekiel, who was mature and one with God so that the heavens were opened to him (Ezek. 1:1). Today the principle is the same. We need the heavens opened to us. If we are today's Ezekiels, the heavens will be opened to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Vision Received</H2><P>Not only were the heavens opened, but also a vision was revealed or unveiled. This message is not a kind of sermon that I have composed by collecting materials from different books. It is shameful to collect materials from others' books and then pass them on to the children of God. What we pass on to the children of God must be something we have seen. It must be something as a vision we have received from the open heavens. What I am ministering to you is not a theory, a concept, a teaching, a doctrine, or a kind of systematic theology from a seminary. Rather, it is a vision from the open heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>An Express Word</H2><P>Furthermore, the word of God came to Ezekiel expressly. We need an express word, not an ordinary word. For such an express word, do not go to the expositions of the Bible. Do not even go to the books of Watchman Nee or Witness Lee. You must have an express word from the Lord. With Ezekiel, the heavens were opened, the visions came, and the express word also came.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Hand of God</H2><P>What followed the express word of God? The hand of God followed. If what we minister is truly God's word God's hand will follow. God's hand always follows His speaking. Whatever He says, He does. If you minister a lot, and nothing happens, this means you have a babbling mouth, but God's hand is not working. You may have a speaking mouth, but you need God's almighty hand to work out what you speak. Oh, today we need the heavens opened; we need the vision coming to us; we need the word to come expressly; and we need God's hand to follow! If I were speaking and the divine hand did not follow, that would be a vain babbling and you should forget it. But if what I am ministering here is God's express word, be careful. Don't touch the word. I may be a small man, but God's hand is not a small thing. He will work according to His speaking.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WIND, THE CLOUD, THE FIRE,<br>AND THE ELECTRUM</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:4; Psa. 75:6, 7a; Ezek. 37:9; John 3:8; Acts 2:2, 4a; Exo. 24:16a; 40:34; Deut. 4:24; Heb. 12:29; Ezek. 1:27a, 28; 8:2b, 4; Rev. 4:3a; 22:1</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR MAIN THINGS</H2><P>Ezekiel 1:4 covers four main things: the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. The Bible is a book full of pictures revealing to us God and the spiritual things. Because God is Spirit, He is very abstract and mysterious. Without a picture, it would be rather difficult for us to understand God and spiritual things. The Bible uses many types, figures, and pictures to describe and portray to us the spiritual things. The book of Ezekiel is especially a book of pictures. The visions Ezekiel saw were absolutely related to God and to spiritual things. Through the figures and pictures, the invisible, spiritual things become visible to us. Chapter one of Ezekiel has many figures and pictures. Verse four alone covers four figures: the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. The picture in this one verse is better than a thousand words. Let us consider these figures in detail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE STORMY WIND</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>From the North</H2><P>First of all, the wind came from the north. Why did the wind come from the north, and not from the south, or from the east, or from the west? The answer is in Psalm 75. There it says that the lifting up, the promotion, comes not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south, but that God judges. What does this prove? This proves that God is at the north. Even in geographical terms the north is always up. North is not down; north is up. Of course, God is always up. When we are going north, we say we are going up. This means that when we are going north we are going to God. The wind from the north means that the wind came from God. God is the source of this wind. The dwelling place, the habitation of God, is the very source of all spiritual things. The wind came from the north, from the habitation of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Signifying the Spirit of God</H2><P>The Hebrew word for wind is ruach. Ruach may be translated wind, breath, or spirit. In the King James Version, this same Hebrew word, ruach, is translated into all three of these words in Ezekiel 37. In verse 9 of that chapter, ruach is translated into wind; in verses 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10, ruach is translated into breath; and in verses 1 and 14, ruach is translated into Spirit. It is very difficult for the translators to decide whether in a certain verse it means the wind, the breath, or the spirit. The decision must be made according to the context. Ruach, which in 1:4 is translated into wind, is nothing less than the powerful Spirit. It is not just a wind, but a stormy wind.</P><P>On the day of Pentecost there was a rushing, mighty wind which filled the house where they were sitting (Acts 2:2). Then all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit. No doubt the mighty, rushing wind is just the powerful Spirit. In John 3:8, the Lord Jesus said, "the wind blows..." Some versions point out in their footnote that this word wind is translated from the Greek word pneuma. The Hebrew word ruach is exactly the same as the Greek word pneuma. Pneuma is also translated into wind, breath, or spirit, depending on the context of the verse. Thus, what the Lord Jesus said may also be translated as "the Spirit blows..." In Ezekiel 1, the wind is a figure, a picture of the mighty Spirit of God. This is not a weak wind, but a strong, stormy wind.</P><P>All our spiritual experiences always start with a spiritual storm. Even when you were saved, there was a storm. Perhaps you were a student who was caring for nothing but studying, playing, and simply going to school. But one day a storm came to you. A stormy wind blew upon you and turned you upside down. This caused you to consider: "What is the meaning of human life? Where did I come from? Where shall I go?" This was the blowing of the stormy wind. Surely all the saved ones experienced a storm at their conversion. I can never forget the storm that I experienced. I was a young man under twenty years of age and full of ambition. I was studying hard in order to have a good future. But one day I listened to a gospel message and a stormy wind blew upon me and turned me upside down. Didn't you also have such a storm? Whether you are young or old, you all had such a storm. Not only at the time of our salvation, but also even after we were saved we had many storms. Some of the dear ones in the local churches were missionaries on the mission field or Christian workers. One day a storm came and turned everything upside down. This caused them to seek the Lord desperately and eventually to come into the local churches.</P><P>Not only at our conversion, but at every turn of our spiritual life a storm comes to us from the Lord. Praise the Lord! It is not bad&#151;it is really grace to have a storm coming from God. Praise God! He is a God who gives us the storms. Many storms come to us from the north. I cannot tell you how many storms I have received. Every storm is worthwhile to recall. I do believe that when we are in eternity, we will recall the storms. The storms will be a pleasant remembrance to us. As we follow the Lord, many storms will come to us. Hallelujah! The stormy wind is just God Himself. He blows upon us to bring a storm into our life, into our work, and into our church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CLOUD</H2><P>The cloud always follows the stormy wind. If you have the wind, surely you will have the cloud. What is the meaning of the cloud? By considering the history of the people of Israel it is easy to understand the meaning of the cloud. After the Israelites came out of Egypt, they arrived at Sinai, camped there, and set up a tent for God. Then God's glory descended upon that tent. All the people saw that the cloud was covering the tent of meeting. That cloud was a figure of God covering His people. That was God brooding over His people. The cloud is just the brooding God. He comes as the wind, but He stays as the cloud. By His staying as a cloud, He is covering, overshadowing, and brooding to give us the enjoyment of His presence. This is to produce something of Himself in our daily life. It is wonderful! Whenever we experience God as the blowing wind, we also have the sensation that He is overshadowing, covering, and brooding over us. The blowing of the wind brings the presence of God to us in the form of a heavenly cloud. The presence of God is just the heavenly, brooding, and overshadowing cloud.</P><P>On one Lord's day afternoon in 1935, I was ministering about the Spirit. When I came to a certain point, I had the sensation that a cloud had come down and was covering me. Though I saw nothing with my physical eyes, I did have the sensation that something was overshadowing me. I was in that covering. I had a sensation of the practical presence of the Lord. It is not only a matter by faith; it is also a matter of sensation. I did have the sensation that I was covered and overshadowed by the presence of the Lord. At that time the presence of the Lord was like a cloud to me. It was so wonderful, so sweet, so comforting, so strengthening, so energizing! Immediately I began to speak in a very powerful way.</P><P>Surely you have experienced the Lord in such a way. In your morning watch or in your pray-reading, the stormy wind came and blew upon you. Then following the blowing wind came the cloud. Perhaps the cloud even lasted the whole day. All day long you had the sensation that something was following you, covering you, brooding over you, and overshadowing you. You had the sensation of the enjoyment of the Lord's presence all day long. I have experienced this many times. In my morning watch, the stormy wind blew upon me. The Lord came to me from the north like a blowing wind. Right away, I received the Lord's presence as a cloud. The presence of the Lord was covering me like a cloud. His presence then became my enjoyment. All day I was experiencing His covering and enjoying His presence. We must all have this kind of experience. When you come to the Bible, do not seek after the teachings or the doctrines. You have to say, "Lord, blow upon me and grant me the overshadowing cloud. Lord, grant me the wind and grant me the cloud."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FIRE</H2><P>Ezekiel saw that the cloud which overshadowed him was covered with fire flashing continually. This is really according to our experience. When the stormy wind comes from the Lord and the covering cloud with the overshadowing presence of the Lord remains, there is also the sensation that something within us is shining and searching and burning. Under such an enlightening, flashing, shining, and searching, we realize that our attitude toward certain brothers is wrong or that other things are wrong before the Lord. Under the searching of the Lord's presence we are exposed. We condemn ourselves and confess our shortness. Then the searching and shining will burn within us to burn out all the negative things. If you experience the Lord in such a way, there is no need for me to tell you that you are wrong with a certain brother. If I tell you, you might be offended and not take my word. But even if you are not offended and you take my word and you go to the brother to get clear with him, that means nothing as far as the inner life. We must be under the searching of the Lord's presence. Under the condemnation of His shining, we will be willing to say, "Lord Jesus, burn me up. I am good for nothing. I am only good for being burned. Lord, burn out my disposition; burn out my intention; burn out my self-aim; burn out my motives; burn out my goal; burn out this and burn out that." What is this? This is the real experience of the inner life. This is not just some teaching.</P><P>After ministering the word of the Lord to the Lord's people for many years, I have found that mere teaching never works out anything. You and I all need the blowing of the wind; we need the overshadowing of the Lord's presence; and we need the searching, burning of this fire. The wind is the Lord Himself; the cloud is the Lord Himself; and the fire is also the Lord Himself. When He comes, He comes as the stormy wind. When He remains with us, He remains as the cloud. When He burns and searches, He burns and searches as the consuming fire. No one can experience the Lord as the blowing wind, covering cloud, and as the burning fire without having a real change and transformation.</P><P>Once an item is consumed by fire, only ashes remain. That is a real transformation and change. We all need the transformation by fire. We need to be transformed by being burned. Our God, the Lord Jesus, is not only the living water, but also the consuming fire. Many Christians enjoy Ezekiel 47 because in that chapter is the flowing river. But the flowing river is not the first thing in Ezekiel. The first thing is the burning, consuming fire. In chapter one is the fire; in chapter forty-seven is the river. The fire always comes first. What is the source of the fire? It is from the blowing wind plus the covering cloud. The fire does not come to us directly. God always comes to us as the blowing wind and stays with us as the covering cloud. Then under His covering we are exposed by His shining. Under such a shining we would confess, "Lord, I am just good for nothing. I am only good for being burnt. Oh Lord, burn me, Lord! Burn me out! Burn out my old nature! Burn out my self, my disposition, my attitudes, my goals, my aims, my motives, my intentions, my relationships with other people, my worldliness. Lord, burn all these things out of me." One such burning is better than a thousand teachings. I do not have much trust in the teachings, but I would like to see all of you burned by the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ELECTRUM</H2><P>But this is not all. God's intention is not just to burn us and turn us into ashes. Our God has a good purpose. Out of the fire comes the glowing electrum. The word electrum is very difficult to translate. No other language has an equivalent to this Hebrew word. J. N. Darby says in his note on Ezekiel 1:4 that some would suggest that electrum is a kind of shining metal, a mixture of gold and silver. One Jewish version also uses this word electrum. Electrum is a metal that is a mixture of gold and silver. The King James Version renders it as amber because the color of this shining metal is the color of amber. Amber is a color somewhat like the color of gold. Praise the Lord for His revelation of this word. It is not merely gold nor merely silver, but gold mixed with silver.</P><P>In the book of Revelation we can see the same principle. There is the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). On the throne is not just the Lamb and not just God, but the Lamb-God. This is the Lamb-God, the redeeming God. In Genesis 1, He was solely God having nothing of the element of redemption within Him; but in Revelation He is the redeeming God, the Lamb-God.</P><P>In Revelation 4:3, God is on the throne. His appearance is like two kinds of precious stones&#151;jasper and sardius. Sardius is red and jasper is a green crystal. The red color of sardius signifies redemption and the crystal green of jasper signifies God's divine nature. This picture shows us that God looks like both jasper and sardius. He is no more just God, having only the divine nature; He is also our Redeemer.</P><P>These two illustrations from the book of Revelation help us to understand the electrum. Our God is not merely a divine Being represented by the gold. He is now the electrum&#151;gold mingled with silver. By putting all these items together, we have such a clear picture of our experience. First we experience the blowing wind; next we enjoy the covering cloud; then we experience the burning and consuming fire. The result is that the electrum is produced. Something is so shining, so precious! As the electrum, He is everything to us. Jesus is our God and He is our Lamb. Jesus is our jasper and He is our sardius. This is the electrum. We must experience God as the spiritual wind, as the overshadowing cloud, as the burning fire, as the Lamb, and as the glowing electrum. By passing through this kind of experience, we become the vision of the glory of such a God. When people look upon us they can see the wind; they can see the cloud; they can see the fire; and they can see the electrum. Whenever we meet together, we must be the vision of God. We must be the vision of the glory of the electrum. We do have something shining, something glowing, something so precious, so dear, like a treasure. We just cannot tell whether He is merely God, or whether He is the Savior. He is everything to us&#151;He is the electrum.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BASIC EXPERIENCE</H2><P>This is the first vision seen by Ezekiel. Among all our experiences in life, this is the most basic. As we go on through this chapter we will see other categories of our experiences, but this is the first and most basic. We must ask the Lord for the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum! We do not experience these things once for all. Rather this cycle must be repeated again and again. First comes the wind, then the cloud, then the fire, and then the electrum. A few days later, the wind comes again with the cloud, with the fire, and with more electrum. In a sense, we Christians have no rest in our spiritual experiences. I have been a Christian for over 45 years and I have never had any rest. Always there has been the blowing, the covering, the burning, and then the receiving of something as the electrum. Suppose this cycle would be stopped. That would be awful! In our experience this cycle should never be stopped. The more often we can experience this cycle, the better. Every day we should have a cycle. Every day we should experience the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. This is the real experience of the inner life and this will bring in the growth in life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:5-6, 26; Rev. 5:9b; John 5:25; Col. 2:12-13; Phil. 2:7-8; Mark 10:45; Rev. 5:5; Exo. 19:4; Isa. 40:31; Phil. 4:11-13</H1><P>Ezekiel is a book of pictures portraying the spiritual things. In the last chapter we saw four things: the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. These four items are pictures portraying what God is to us. In our experience, God is like a blowing wind and like a cloud&#151;brooding, hovering, and overshadowing us. He is also like fire, shining upon us and enlightening us. By burning us, He sanctifies us. This kind of burning is the real sanctification. We do not need to "take time to be holy"; we need to be burned. If we mean business with the Lord in desiring to be sanctified, we must be willing to be burned. "Our God is a consuming fire" (Heb. 12:29). He is a jealous, sanctifying God. Furthermore, God is to us like glowing, shining electrum. Electrum signifies the compounded God. Today the God Who is in us has more than simply the divine nature. The gold of the divine nature has been compounded with the silver of the redeeming Lamb. For the Jews, God is typified merely by gold, but for us Christians, God is gold mixed with silver. He is electrum.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Dead, But Living</H2><P>Now we come to Ezekiel 1:5: "Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man." Pay particular attention to the first word in this verse, "also." Not only does electrum come out of the fire, something more also comes out. The wind brings in the cloud; the cloud enfolds the fire; and the fire produces the electrum plus something more. "Also" refers to the four living creatures. When we experience God as the blowing wind, the overshadowing cloud, the burning fire, and the glowing electrum, we become the four living creatures. We were dead, but we have become living creatures. We not only have God as the electrum, but we ourselves also become living.</P><P>The Lord Jesus said that the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and shall live (John 5:25). Paul said that we were dead, but that God has made us alive (Eph. 2:5). The more we have the cycle of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, the more we will become living. Every time we are blown by God and overshadowed by God, burned and consumed by God, we are enlivened. If you are not so alive in the meetings, it proves that you are short of the experience of this cycle. The more we have the experience of this cycle, the more we will be living.</P><P>Today's Christianity always likes to have a quiet service. If you would like to have a quiet service, you had better go to a cemetery. That is the quietest place because everybody is dead and buried. But we must be noisy. Only those who are living can make noise. Even if you offered a million dollars to the dead ones and asked them to be noisy, they could not do it. We must be living. We must be noisy because we have experienced God as the wind and the fire with the blowing and the consuming. How can we be quiet? We cannot be quiet because we are the real living creatures. The word "living" in Hebrew has the same root as the word "life" in Genesis 2, where it refers to the tree of life. How can we, the creatures, become living creatures? By experiencing God as the tree of life, we will have something living within us. A living element, a living factor, will be in us. This living thing within us will continually make us living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Four in Number</H2><P>The picture in this verse portrays us not only as being living creatures, but also as being four in number. Why does it not say five or six or ten living creatures? It is very significant. Many verses in the Bible show us that the number four signifies man as the creature. Revelation 5:9 is particularly clear. It says that the Lord has redeemed us from four sources: from every kindred, every tongue, every people, and every nation. Furthermore, Revelation 21 shows us that the New Jerusalem has four sides&#151;the north, the east, the west, and the south&#151;and that each of the four sides has three gates. This means that from every direction on the earth we can enter this city. The number four symbolizes that we are the people redeemed from many kindreds, tongues, peoples, and nations. In the eyes of God, we are the four living creatures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Corporate Expression</H2><P>These living creatures are not reckoned as individuals; they are counted as a group. All of them are counted as one entity. Later we will see that these living creatures are the expression of the one man on the throne. They do not express this man in one direction only, but in every direction. We know that on this earth there are only four directions&#151;north, east, west, and south. This means that we as the four living creatures are not only the unique expression of Christ, but also the complete expression of Christ. We express Christ in every direction, toward every side. We are the four living creatures expressing Christ in an adequate and complete way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEARING THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN</H2><P>The main point of Ezekiel 1:5 is that each of the four living creatures bears the appearance of a man. This word may not be pleasing to many religious friends because they would like to be angels. Perhaps we all think that it is better to be an angel than to be a man. Which would you rather be, a man or an angel? I am afraid that many of us would prefer to be an angel. God, however, has enough angels. But God is short of men. God does not appreciate the angels so much. The angels are His servants. When He tells them to go, they go. When He tells them to come, they come. Do you know that we also have our own angels? When Peter was released from prison and went to Mary's house, some said that it was his angel. Peter had an angel and we also have angels. Angels are not that precious; they are our servants. We must drop our concept that it would be good to be an angel. Rather we need to see how glorious, how marvelous it is that we are men. We should tell the whole universe, "I am a man. I am a VIP. I am the center of the universe. I am the meaning of the universe." It is not a small matter to be a man.</P><P>If we would not desire to be like angels, at least we would desire to be like God. Many Christians practice day and night to be like God. But God wants to be like us. He even became a man. Today in the heavens, the Lord Jesus who is God is still a man. A man is upon the throne (Acts 7:56). God is the Creator of the universe, but He needs an expression. Without man, God has no expression. The millions of angels could never be the expression of God. God needs a corporate man to express Him. Never despise the fact that you are a man.</P><P>There are four men in the Bible: the first man, the second man, the new man, and the manchild. We were the first man by birth; we became the new man by regeneration; and now there is the prospect that we may become the manchild. This ministry is not only for the new man, but for the manchild as well. Though some today may talk about the expression of Christ, few realize what the real expression of Christ is. The Christ whom the church must express is the man upon the throne. If we are going to express Christ, we must realize that Christ today is a man. We do not express merely God; we express God in a man. The church is the expression of Christ, not merely the expression of God.</P><P>Ezekiel 1:26 tells us that the Lord today is a man on the throne. We as the living creatures express Him as a man. He is the man on the throne, and we also bear the appearance of a man. All the living creatures bear the appearance of a man. It is man who fulfills God's plan. It is man who expresses God. It is man who defeats Satan. It is man who brings the kingdom of God into the human race. Today God needs a man. We may want to be like God, but God wants to be like us. He became a man, and today He is still a man. The religious teachings in Christianity encourage you either to be like an angel or to be like God. But the revelation of God unveils to us that God's desire is to have a man. Remember that the subtle one tempted the first man by telling him that if he would take of the tree of knowledge, he would be like God (Gen. 3:5). From that day, the concept of being like God has been in our blood. All of fallen mankind has the concept of wanting to be like God. Devilish teachings such as Buddhism and Taoism always encourage people to be something other than man. God in His redemption and salvation has no intention of making us anything other than man. God's redemption and salvation are to bring us back to the beginning and to recover us to being a proper man. We are the living creatures, yet we bear the appearance of a man. Never behave as an angel. Whatever you do, whatever you say, whatever you express, you must be a man. Today God needs a man. He became a man, and He is still a man. We, the living creatures, also bear the appearance of a man.</P><P>Each of these four living creatures has four faces. If we saw someone with four such faces, we all would be frightened. Suppose he had the face of a man in the front, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left, and the face of an eagle at the back. Would you not be frightened? Yet this is exactly what we must be. We all must have these four faces.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FACE OF A MAN</H2><P>The first face is the face of a man, because we ourselves are men. Since we are men, we should look like men. We were created as men, but we were corrupted, poisoned, and damaged by the fall. Therefore, we needed the Lord's redemption. By the Lord's redemption, we were brought back to the proper humanity. Strictly speaking, the humanity we have now is not ours but His. We have the humanity of Jesus within us. Among the Chinese people there is a kind of saying that it is difficult to be a man. They feel that it is preferable to end the human life by death and to become something else. But this concept is absolutely different from the Lord's salvation. The Lord's salvation is to make us proper men. Some of the husbands might say, "I am tired of being a husband." But you must realize that the Lord's salvation is to make you a proper husband on the earth. If you are a wife, the Lord's salvation is to make you a proper wife. If you are a parent, the Lord's salvation is to make you a proper parent. If you are a child, the Lord's salvation is to make you a proper child. Hallelujah, the Lord's salvation is to make us proper human beings! Thus, we all must bear the face of a man. Occasionally, I have seen some seeking ones, particularly sisters, who do not seem to be human beings. They are so "spiritual" that it seems they are strange creatures&#151;half human and half angel. They even practice this kind of behavior. Sometimes I upset this kind of situation by causing them either to laugh at me or to become angry. Then they became real. Once a dear sister whom I knew quite well came to me in a peculiar way&#151;as half human and half angel. Because I was really unhappy with that, I said to her, "Sister, I know that you are always not right with your husband." Immediately she blew up. "What!" she said, "Brother Lee, you are a brother and you always take the side of the brothers!" Then I said to her, "Now I am happy." The half angel was blown away by my speaking.</P><P>We all prefer to be something else. The sisters especially like to be something else, but we all need simply to be human. Never pretend to be something else. You must be what you are&#151;a man. But this is not to be human by your own humanity, but by the Lord's humanity. We need to have the face of a man. Please read the four Gospels again and notice that Jesus was a person with the proper humanity. Many who read the four Gospels only pay attention to the miracles worked out by His divinity; they never pay attention to the things worked out by the Lord's humanity. I like to see the beauty shown in the Lord's humanity. For example, John 4 relates how the Lord Jesus was traveling with His disciples to the city of Samaria. Because He was tired and thirsty, He asked His disciples to go into the city to buy something to eat, while He rested. After they were gone, the Samaritan woman came. What a marvelous picture! He was the Almighty God, yet He was behaving Himself like a normal man, without any hint that He was God. When He asked the woman for water, He gave no indication that He was anything more than a man. That woman even rebuked Him, and He was willing to suffer her rebuke. The four Gospels record many stories like this. The Lord Jesus behaved Himself like a normal human being, bearing the face of a man. Today, we too must bear the face of a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FACE OF A LION</H2><P>We also must bear the face of a lion. A lion in the Bible signifies boldness, vigor, strength, and victory. What does this mean? In our Christian life we need first to be a man. At our school, in our office, among our neighbors, we must be a man. But we must also be a lion. If in the office you are a proper man, it will draw people to you. When they are drawn to you, they will be the germs corrupting you. They will like you and invite you to participate in evil things, such as movies. At that time you must not behave as a man, but as a lion. Toward anything sinful or worldly, we must be as bold as a lion. All the people working in your office should know that if they talk to you about going to a movie, you will behave like a lion. People always consider that the Lord Jesus was gentle and mild. But at least once He was not gentle. When He went into the temple and saw all the moneychangers, He whipped them. He was mad. Furthermore, one day He called those Pharisees a generation of vipers (Matt. 23:33). He was bold and vigorous, even mad. He was really like a lion. In Revelation, He is called "The Lion of the tribe of Judah" (Rev. 5:5). We all must have the face of a lion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FACE OF AN OX</H2><P>We need not only the face of a man and the face of a lion but also a third face, the face of an ox. Though you may be always as bold as a lion in your office, that alone will never convince people. You need to be balanced by having the face of an ox. What is an ox? An ox is one who is willing to bear the burden, to do the work, and even to sacrifice himself. We all must have such an appearance, such a reality of serving others, bearing the burden, caring for the responsibility, even sacrificing our life. If you are working in an office, and are on the one hand a proper man, on the other hand as bold as a lion, and you are also faithful in bearing responsibility, you will leave a good impression upon others. You must learn to behave yourself not only like a proper man or like a bold lion, but also like a serving, suffering ox. When the office is dirty and your colleagues start to clean, you must take the lead to clean. You should even clean more than others. You must show that you are willing to sacrifice, to help others, and to serve others. Then you will have the reality of the face of an ox. You will not only have the appearance of a man or a lion, but also of an ox.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FACE OF AN EAGLE</H2><P>Finally, we also need a hidden face. In the back, not easily seen by people, we need the face of an eagle. In the Bible, an eagle always signifies a powerful, transcendent God. God is transcendent, buoyant, and powerful. Nothing can suppress Him. Nothing can oppress or depress Him. The more you try to suppress Him, the more He flies to the heavens. This is the meaning of the eagle and the eagle's wings. In Exodus 19, God told His people, "...I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself." We must be like an eagle. We must not allow anything to suppress us, to hold us, or to depress us. Whether it be persecution or praise, we would never be overcome. It is more difficult to overcome praise than persecution. Many of us can overcome persecution, but not peoples' praises. Nevertheless, whether people persecute us or praise us, we must fly away on the eagle's wings.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus fed 5,000 people with five loaves and two fishes, they came and tried to make Him king. But the Lord Jesus could not be held because He had the power of an eagle. You can never hold Jesus. Neither should a Christian be held by anything. One believer may be held by poverty while another is held by riches. As a proper Christian, we should not be held by anything. Neither riches nor poverty mean anything. We should be like Paul, who knew how to be abased and how to abound. Whether he was rich or he was in want, he did not care. Everywhere, in everything, he could do all things in Him who empowered him (Phil. 4:11-13). Paul had the wings of an eagle. He bore the appearance of a man, a lion, an ox, and also an eagle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPRESSING CHRIST</H2><P>These four faces&#151;the face of a man, the face of a lion, the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle&#151;simply portray the life of Christ. The four Gospels are a biography of Jesus. Why are there four Gospels? It is because one, Luke, shows Him as a man. Another, Matthew, shows Him as a lion. Mark shows Him as an ox, and John shows Him as an eagle. This four-fold life is the life of Christ. All the living creatures are the corporate expression of Christ. As Christians, we must be the living creatures who are a corporate entity, expressing Christ exactly as He was on earth. While He was on earth, He was living in these four aspects: as a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. Today we must be such an expression of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EAGLE'S WINGS, THE MAN'S HANDS,<br>AND THE CALF'S HOOFS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:6b-9a, 11b; Exo. 19:4; Isa. 40:31; 2 Cor. 4:7; 1:12; 12:9; 1 Cor. 15:10; Phil. 4:13; Psa. 17:8b; 57:1b; Acts 20:34; Col. 3:9; Psa. 29:6a; Rev. 1:15</H1><P>The first chapter of Ezekiel contains many figures comprising one complete picture. Unless all the figures found there are applied in a spiritual way, they seem to be obscure. If we apply all these things spiritually, they are very significant.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING FOUR WINGS OF AN EAGLE</H2><P>We need to see more concerning the four living creatures. Ezekiel 1:6-9 tells us that each one of the four living creatures has four wings and four sides. Surely the wings are the wings of an eagle because, of the creatures represented by the four faces, only the eagle has wings. Then, underneath the wings on four sides are found the hands of a man. Furthermore, it tells us that the feet are straight. Of the creatures having these four kinds of faces, only one, the ox, has straight feet. All the others do not have straight feet. Man's feet are like an "L." The lion does not have feet, but rather has paws with claws. The eagle also has claws. Only the ox has straight feet. Strictly speaking, here it is not the ox's feet, but the calf's feet, or hoofs. If we would understand these points concerning the wings, the man's hands, and the straight feet, we must remember the blowing of the wind, the hovering and brooding of the cloud, and the consuming, searching, enlightening, and burning of the fire, out of which comes the glowing electrum. This causes us to become the living creatures, expressing Christ and living out His life in a corporate way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Eagle's Wings</H2><P>According to the pure Word, it is easy for us to apply all three of these aspects. The eagle's wings in the Bible signify the strength of God to us. In Exodus 19:4, God said to His people, "I bare you on eagles' wings." This is the strength of God. Isaiah 40:31 says that if we wait on the Lord we will mount up with wings as eagles. We shall run and we shall walk, never becoming weary and never fainting. This shows that God's strength to us is just like the eagle's wings.</P><P>The New Testament also shows us the interpretation of the eagle's wings. In the New Testament, the eagle's wings signify the grace, the power, and the strength of God in Christ to us. Second Corinthians 4:7 says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may not be of us, but of God. This is the eagle's wings. Paul also said that he had the confidence in his conscience that all his conduct on the earth was not by his wisdom, but by the grace of God (2 Cor. 1:12). Again, this is the eagle's wings. The Lord Jesus told Paul, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness" (2 Cor. 12:9). Thus, Paul was happy to boast in his weaknesses in order that the power of Christ might rest upon him and overshadow him. The power of Christ overshadowed him, even as the eagle's wings overshadowed the covered ones. These verses indicate to us that the eagle's wings signify the strength and the grace of the Lord Jesus. Paul also said, "But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me" (1 Cor. 15:10). This is the eagle's wings. Whatever we do must not be according to our own wisdom, our own strength, or our own ability. It must be by the grace and power and strength of the Lord. If we have any boast, it must be in the Lord. We have no boast in anything else. We have no boast in ourselves. Our boast is in the Lord. His power, His strength, and His grace are the eagle's wings to us today. We all must bear the four wings on the four sides, showing people that whatever we do and whatever we are is not by ourselves, but by God. By this, the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us (2 Cor. 4:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>For Covering and for Moving</H2><P>Each of the four living creatures had four wings, two for covering and two for moving. Two wings are for moving and joining one to the other. The joining is for the moving. In a later chapter we will see that the moving is altogether a corporate matter. Here, two wings are for moving and two are for covering. The grace, the power, and the strength of the Lord to us is not only for moving, but also for covering us. We are under the overshadowing of the grace and power of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are under the covering of His power. Whatever we do and whatever we are must be by the grace and power of the Lord. At the same time, we are under the overshadowing, the covering of the Lord's grace. As Christians, we should have an element that causes people to wonder at us. Many times, they should be able to realize that something is covering and overshadowing us. On the one hand, they should realize we are normal people, yet with us there is something empowering, something strengthening, some thing overshadowing, and something covering.</P><P>The front face of the four living creatures is the face of a man, but the body is that of an eagle. Two of his wings are stretched forth to join to the other living creatures, and two of his wings are wrapped around his body for a cover. Thus, if you look at his face, he looks like a man, but if you look at his body, he looks like an eagle. He looks like a man, but he moves like an eagle. We must express ourselves all the time like a man, like a normal and proper husband, wife, parent, child, student, or teacher; but when people look and consider us, they should realize there is something covering, empowering, strengthening, protecting, and overshadowing us. It should be difficult for people to explain us. We should be able to suffer things others cannot suffer. We should bear responsibility that others cannot bear. We should understand things more deeply than others do. With us, there must be something mysterious; though we suffer, we are always happy. Something is always covering us. Thus, we have two wings for moving, and we have another two wings for covering and overshadowing us. Those moving and overshadowing wings should give people the impression of the Divine Being. That is the eagle. We have the four wings of an eagle, giving people the impression that we have God with us as our power and our protection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING THE HANDS OF A MAN</H2><P>Under the wings are the hands of a man. This means that a proper, normal Christian must always do things exactly like a man. He must use man's hands. Paul said that his two hands ministered to his own necessities and to the needs of his co-workers (Acts 20:34). Some say they have faith in the almighty God to supply all their needs, hence there is no need for them to use their hands to do anything. But consider the Apostle Paul. With Paul there were always the two sides. Surely there were not only the four wings, but also the hands of a man. He said it was not by his wisdom, but by the grace of God and that the grace of God with him was not in vain (2 Cor. 1:12; 1 Cor. 15:10). This is the side of the eagle's wings. But he also said he labored more than all the other apostles (1 Cor. 15:10). You may think there was no need for Paul to work with his own hands. But Paul took the way of working with his own hands; he took the human way.</P><P>Sometimes young people imagine that because they are seeking the Lord, there is no need for them to study hard. They hope that when the test comes they will pass with an A+. This is absolutely wrong. No matter how much you seek the Lord, no matter how much you love Him and care for Him, you still must study hard to prepare your lessons. No matter how much the grace of God is with us empowering us, we must fulfill our human duty. We must daily eat the proper human food in the human way, according to human principles. If we do not eat humanly but rather like an angel, we will become sick. We must do things like a human. Under the four wings are the man's hands. The hands of a man must always be working. This is a battle. The worldly people have only the man's hands. They have no eagle's wings. But many so-called religious people seem to have only the eagle's wings; they do not seem to have the hands of a man. They seem to be like an angel. We must have both. We must have the wings of the Lord's empowering grace and the hands of a man, cooperating with God in a human way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING THE HOOFS OF A CALF</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Straight</H2><P>The third aspect, the calf's hoofs, concerns our Christian walk. We all must walk like a calf, having straight hoofs. To walk with a lion's paws is terrible. No Christian should walk on lion's paws. While we can apply the boldness of a lion to our Christian character, we should not apply the lion's paws to the Christian walk. Neither should we walk with the claws of an eagle. If one is walking with the claws of an eagle, we always must be careful because sooner or later he may hurt us. Neither should we walk with the feet of a man. Man's feet are good, but they are a little crooked; they are not so straight. Paul said that in the world he had his conversation, his conduct with simplicity, not with man's cleverness (2 Cor. 1:12).</P><P>Our Christian walk must be straight; it must be frank and never crooked. This is why Paul told us not to lie one to another (Col. 3:9). Never lie to a brother. To lie is to be crooked. If you are able to speak something, speak it honestly. If you are unable to speak honestly, simply do not speak.</P><P>During the last six days before the Lord Jesus was crucified, He went to Jerusalem and was surrounded by the leaders of religion and politics. Some of the leaders came to Him and asked Him who gave Him the authority to do these things. The Lord Jesus in turn asked them whether the baptism of John the Baptist was from men or from heaven. They knew that if they said the baptism of John came from the heavens, He would ask them why they did not believe him. If on the other hand, they said that it was not from the heavens, the people would stone them because they considered John to be a prophet. In this kind of dilemma they considered that the best answer was a crooked one. They turned to the Lord Jesus and said, "We do not know." Really they did know. They knew, but they would not tell. This means that they were crooked. Because the Lord Jesus knew their crookedness, He said that He would not tell them either (Matt. 21:23-27). He meant that since they would not tell Him, neither would He tell them. The Lord Jesus was really straight and strict, but the Pharisees were crooked. The Lord Jesus' feet were the calf's hoofs; with Him there was no crookedness. By reading the four Gospels, we can see that while the Lord Jesus was on earth, He walked very straight. Step by step His walk was straight. He was walking on this earth with calf's hoofs.</P><P>We also should be walking in this way today. If we are walking in a crooked way, we should not expect the church to be built up. We all must learn to be frank, honest, faithful, and sincere. Be simple and be single. If we mean yes, we should say yes; if we mean no, we should say no. Anything more than that is from the Devil (Matt. 5:37).</P><P>The Devil is the father of all lies (John 8:44). Even if you lie with a good intention that is still of the Devil. We should not walk according to our crooked man's feet. Our feet are not straight; they have a turn. But the calf's hoofs have no turn; they are straight.</P><P>Not only was the Lord Jesus so straight, but also the Apostle Paul was very straight, frank, faithful, and honest. By reading the two Epistles to the Corinthians, we realize that Paul was such a strict and frank person. He asked, "Shall I come unto you with a rod?" (1 Cor. 4:21). What if one of the Lord's servants should write a letter asking such a question to a church today? The whole congregation would be shocked. If we would be a faithful servant of the Lord we must be straight in such a way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Cloven</H2><P>The calf's hoofs are not only straight, but also cloven or divided. Each hoof of the calf is divided. According to Leviticus 11:4-6, an animal that does not have the cloven hoofs is not clean. All the clean animals have their hoofs divided. The clean cattle such as the cow and the sheep have two characteristics: the chewing of the cud and the dividing of the hoof. The divided hoof signifies that in our walk with the Lord we need a proper discernment to divide the right things from the wrong and the clean things from the unclean. The calf's hoofs are not like those of a camel. A camel's hoof is not cloven, not divided. This means it has a walk without discernment. But we must have such a walk that we can discern what is right and what is wrong in the eyes of God. In our daily Christian walk we need such discernment. Even concerning the church, we need such discernment. In this country the term "local church" has become popular merchandise. Many groups loosely call themselves the local church. We must be able to discern whether a group is in fact a normal, proper, genuine local church. We must discern. We need the cloven hoofs. Do not be loose, thinking that because they say they are a local church, they must indeed be a local church. Some are genuine and some are not. Some are right and some are wrong; some are real and some are not real. We need the discernment. In our daily walk as well as in the church life, we need to have the cloven hoofs of the calf.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Shining as Burnished Brass</H2><P>The calf's hoofs are shining like burnished brass. The shining of the brass comes from the heat of the furnace. The more the brass is burned and tested, the more it shines. This proves that we need a walk that has been tested and burned by the Lord. Then our walk will be like shining brass, giving people light. Our walk will enlighten people and become a kind of shining to people. If we have been tested by the Lord and examined by the Lord, then our walk will shine like burnished brass. It will give people light; it will test them, and cause them to realize whether or not their walk is right. If in the church life we have been tested and examined by the Lord, our walk will be like shining brass giving light to others, shining on others, enlightening others, and testing others. If we are careless and sloppy, lacking discernment, everything is about the same to us. The black, the white, and the gray will all be about the same. This means we are unable to exercise any discernment. If this is our case, our walk will be like a black stone, a darkened stone, with no light. If our walk is a walk of discernment, we will discern all the things in our Christian walk, and eventually our hoofs will be like shining brass wherever we go. Our walk will shine upon others, giving them light and testing them to see whether they are right or wrong.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Skipping in Life</H2><P>The Bible says that the calf is something that skips and jumps (Psa. 29:6). This means that the calf is alive. Our Christian walk must not be a dead walk. It must be a skipping, jumping walk&#151;a walk which is full of life. A calf is young and vigorous, full of energy, always skipping. We all must be like a young calf&#151;full of life. We need to come to the meetings like skipping calves. May the Lord make us to skip like calves. What about your walk? Sometimes the young people behave like older people, not knowing how to skip in a living way. In some of the meetings they are glued to their chairs. They must learn how to skip.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUSION</H2><P>All these are points concerning the Christian walk. It is a walk that is not crooked, but straight and strict. It is also a walk with discernment. It is a walk that shines and gives light to others. It tests others and is always skipping and full of life and energy. When we talk of feet as shining brass, we must remember Revelation 1:15, where it tells us that the Lord Jesus' feet are like shining brass. This means we all must have a walk like the Lord's walk.</P><P>In a later chapter we will see that all four living creatures are coordinated together. They could only be coordinated by this kind of life and this kind of walk. The life is a life with eagle's wings and human hands, and the walk is a walk of the calf's hoofs. By having this kind of life and this kind of walk, we as the living creatures can be coordinated into one entity. Coordination is the central point in this chapter. But that coordination depends upon all the foregoing items: the wind, the cloud, the fire, the electrum, and the four living creatures with the four faces&#151;having the eagle's wings, having human hands, and having a walk with the calf's hoofs. The proper coordination depends upon all these items. We must have such a Christian life and such a Christian walk. We need a life that has the wings of an eagle and the hands of a man, and we must have a walk that has the straight hoofs of a calf. May the Lord impress us with all these aspects so that we may have the proper church life in coordination.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE COORDINATION<br>OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:11b-14; Rom. 12:4-5</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BY THE EAGLE'S WINGS</H2><P>Ezekiel 1:11b-14 reveals to us a very clear picture of coordination. No other verses in the entire Bible reveal coordination in such a definite and practical way as these four verses. These verses tell us that the four living creatures are joined together by using two of their wings. They use two of their wings for moving, and this moving is in coordination. By two of their wings they are joined one to another, and by two of their wings they are coordinated. We have already seen that they use the other two wings to cover themselves. We have also seen that the eagle's wings in the Old Testament symbolize the divine strength, the divine power, and the divine supply. This means that the coordination of the four living creatures is not in themselves. In themselves they do not have the ability to be coordinated. Their coordination is in the divine power, the divine strength, and the divine supply, because the eagle's wings are the means for them to be coordinated with one another. Thus, their coordination does not depend upon themselves. It is not a matter of what they are or of what they can do, but a matter of the eagle's wings. The eagle's wings are the means by which they are coordinated as one. It is by the divine power and strength that they are coordinated.</P><P>By themselves the living creatures are individuals, but with the eagle's wings they are coordinated into one body. This means that the coordination among us Christians is not something of ourselves. What we have in ourselves does not coordinate, but rather divides. In ourselves we are always dividing and separating, never coordinating. Coordination in our human strength will not last very long. But we have the eagle's wings. With the eagle's wings we can be coordinated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TO EXPRESS AND MANIFEST CHRIST</H2><P>We must be coordinated as the four living creatures in order that Christ may be expressed and manifested. We also must be coordinated for the move of the Lord. The Lord moves in the center of the coordination of the living creatures. The coordination is also for God's divine administration and government, because the throne is in the clear sky above such a coordination. The throne is for God's government and administration. Thus, the coordination of the living creatures is for manifesting Christ, for the Lord's move, and for God's divine government.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TABERNACLE JOINED TOGETHER BY THE GOLD</H2><P>The same principle can be seen in the tabernacle in the wilderness (Exo. 26:29-30). The tabernacle was built of forty-eight boards coordinated into one entity. Those boards were coordinated into one building not by themselves, but by the overlaying gold. All the boards were overlaid with gold. Then upon the overlaying gold were the golden rings. Through the golden rings were the golden bars. The gold coordinated all forty-eight boards into one entity. The overlaying gold signifies the divine nature and indicates that God Himself was the coordinating factor that caused all the boards to be one tabernacle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY OF COORDINATION</H2><P>Now we need to see how the four living creatures are coordinated. Each of the four living creatures faces one direction. One of the living creatures faces the north; another living creature faces the south; another living creature faces the east; and the last living creature faces the west. As they face these four directions, two of their wings spread out and touch the adjacent creatures' wings, forming a square. Each of the living creatures uses two of his wings to join with the other living creatures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOING STRAIGHTFORWARD AND NOT TURNING</H2><P>Then Ezekiel says that every one of the living creatures went straightforward. They did not turn, but some returned. While one of the living creatures is walking toward the north, the living creature facing the south must return, walking backward. Thus, one goes straightforward while the opposite creature returns. At the same time, the other two must walk sideways. One walks sideways to the left, and the other walks sideways to the right. No matter which direction the four living creatures are moving, there is no need to turn. One simply goes straightforward, one returns, walking backward, and the other two walk sideways.</P><P>This is a beautiful picture of the coordination that we need in the local churches. Many young people cannot suffer to be coordinated together. Rather, they prefer to be separated. As long as they are separated, there is no suffering. But, once they become coordinated, there is a kind of suffering. In coordination there is no freedom, no convenience, but it saves a lot of turns. If one is walking by himself, he may walk to the north, turn, and walk to the east; he may turn again and walk to the south; he may turn again and walk to the west. He may go in all four of these directions by having many turns. But in the Lord's ministry there is no turning. Everyone must go straightforward. If someone does everything without coordination in the church service, he must make a lot of turns. If he does the cleaning, if he plays the piano, if he does the singing, if he does the speaking, if he does all the functioning, then he must make a lot of turns. In the church service, there is no need of any turns. Everyone has his function; everyone has his position. He can simply go straightforward in his position, in his function. If there is the need of some other direction, others can take care of that. There is no need for him to turn. We all must learn not only how to walk straightforward, but also how to return (that is, to walk backward) and also how to walk sideways. Though this may seem quite awkward, we all must learn this lesson; otherwise, we can never be coordinated. Some brothers and sisters are too flexible. They make a lot of turns. When there is the need to walk south, they walk south. When there is the need to walk east, they turn and walk east. No matter what direction is needed, they always turn to walk in that direction. They do everything. They do not need others to coordinate with them. The problem is that people either want to do everything or nothing at all. If they are asked to walk, they want to walk in all four directions. They want to make a lot of turns.</P><P>In the proper coordinated way, there is no left turn; neither is there a right turn. There are no turns. Either you walk straightforward or you return, that is, you walk backward. Or you walk sideways. The most difficult thing is to walk sideways like a crab. Many brothers and sisters are unable to have a crab walk. We must have the proper coordination in the local churches. In some of the churches, certain brothers and sisters are very capable and they make a lot of turns. Other brothers and sisters are not so capable, so they do nothing. This means there is no coordination. We all must learn to walk straightforward and to walk backward and to walk sideways. We must practice to have this kind of coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COORDINATION IN MINISTRY</H2><P>If in a local church one brother has a ministry to build up the saints and another brother has a ministry of preaching the gospel, they must coordinate. Otherwise, they may cause a problem. If there were only one ministry, there would be little problem. With one ministry, there would be no fighting. But when there are two ministries within a local church, unless these two brothers know how to coordinate, they will surely compete and fight against each other. The brother who is burdened for the gospel will be fighting for the gospel, for the outreach, for the increase. He will go to many brothers and sisters to convince them to join him for the outreach. The other brother will say, "All the gospel-preaching brother knows is outreach. Gospel, gospel, gospel! He brings in many new ones, creating a lot of diaper work. He brings them in, but he doesn't care for them. He is too much for the outreach. Look at today's poor church situation. All the meetings are full of childish, babyish ones." He would tell the saints not to go out for the gospel, but to come and help him do the diaper work. Do you realize that the result of these two ministries would be a kind of division? There would be a division into a gospel sect and a shepherding sect.</P><P>What then shall they do? At this point, they have to learn to coordinate. Whenever the brother with the fishing ministry is functioning, the other brother must learn to walk backward. Then, when the brother with the mending ministry is functioning, the brother with the gospel ministry must learn to walk backward. All the other saints must follow these two, walking sideways. Sometimes they walk sideways to the left, following the fishing ministry. At other times they walk sideways to the right, following the mending ministry. This enables the body to move, but it is not easy to learn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COORDINATION IN THE MEETINGS</H2><P>We must also practice this kind of coordination in the meetings. Some brothers and sisters love to shout in the meetings. When they come in, they are shouting; during the meeting, they are shouting; they love to shout. Sometimes the shouting ones need to return. They need to walk backward. But sometimes those who are so quiet also need to return. They need to walk backward and to shout. The problem is this: neither the shouting ones nor the quiet ones are willing to walk backward. The shouters always shout. The quiet ones are always quiet. Each must learn to walk backward. The shouters need to learn to be quiet, and the quiet ones need to learn to shout. All the others must learn to walk sideways. By this practice, we will never have any kind of division in our meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WALKING BACKWARD AND SIDEWAYS</H2><P>We need not only to walk straightforward, but also to walk backward. We also must learn to walk sideways to the right and sideways to the left. This will cause us to be really coordinated. It is easy to speak in this way, but not easy to practice. What does it mean to walk backward? It is to say "Amen" to another's ministry and to another's burden. It is not to say "Amen" to your own ministry, but "Amen" to another's ministry. While one brother is walking straightforward and you are walking backward, you must say "Amen." This means "Amen" to his ministry. To walk sideways is also to say "Amen." The problem today is that in all the local churches, we have too many turns. We do not have the backward walk or the sideways walk. It is very difficult to help the churches to learn to walk sideways. Few are willing to walk in this way.</P><P>In one local church, a good brother was responsible for the cleaning service group. He did a good job, but he was always hunting for the strong brothers and the capable sisters to join his cleaning service group. He did not care for outreach or for the building up. He only cared for his cleaning service group. Eventually, this caused a problem in that local church. By this you can see that it is easy for us to cause a division, but it is hard for us to have the proper and real coordination. We all must learn to keep our position and to go straightforward. We also must learn to walk backward, saying "Amen" to another's position and ministry. Furthermore, we must learn to walk sideways to the right and sideways to the left. We need these four kinds of walks: the straightforward walk, the backward walk, the sideways walk to the right, and the sideways walk to the left. If we have not learned these four kinds of walks, eventually we will become a problem to our local church. If the young people do not learn to have this kind of walk, eventually they will cause problems in the church. The more they grow and learn, the more they will be able to function and to minister, and the more problems they will cause. This is because they only know how to walk straightforward and to have some turn. But remember, there is no turning in the proper coordination. There is no turning to the left or to the right. There is only the straightforward walk, the backward walk, the sideways walk to the right, and the sideways walk to the left. We all must learn to walk in these four ways.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT</H2><P>If you are the one who is walking straightforward, you must be very careful to walk according to the leading of the Spirit. Ezekiel 1:12 says, "whither the Spirit was to go, they went." To follow the Spirit is not the business of the other three, but the business of the one who is walking straightforward. The one who is walking straightforward must be careful to follow the leading of the Spirit. Otherwise, the coordination will be broken. It is right that a brother should have a fishing ministry and that another brother should have a mending ministry, but there must be the leading of the Spirit as to whether this is the time to have the fishing or the mending. If now is the time for the church to follow and take care of the fishing ministry, that brother must take the lead under the guidance of the Spirit. The whole church must follow and be one with that brother. While the fishing ministry is going on, those who have the mending ministry or other ministries must coordinate by walking backward or sideways. We must all learn this lesson.</P><P>Sometimes brothers need to take the lead to move in a certain direction. But because they are humanly and naturally humble, they hesitate and do not lead in a bold way. This causes the church to be delayed and to have no direction for going on. At other times one who should not be leading takes the lead. This damages the church life. When you should take the lead, do it boldly. When others take the lead, learn to walk backward or sideways. This will enable the church to go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ISSUE OF COORDINATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Becoming Burning Coals</H2><P>The result of the coordination of the four living creatures is that they become the burning coals. They now look like something burning. There is a fire among them and with them. Because they are coordinated as one, God comes in as the fire and they become the burning coals. Every living creature becomes a burning coal. How can we know whether or not in a particular local church there is the proper coordination? We can tell by the burning coals. Is the church burning? If there is no burning, it is a strong proof that there is no coordination. Where there is coordination, there will surely be the burning.</P><P>The burning will do several things. First, the burning will burn out all the negative things. If you have a heap of coals burning together, what could exist among them? Whatever is put upon them will be burned. If in the church there is the proper coordination, there will be the burning to burn out the worldliness, the flesh, the self-aim, the self-goal, the pride, the boasting, and all kinds of negative things. Even all kinds of opinions, teachings, and doctrines will be burned out by the coordination. There will be the burning because everyone is in the proper coordination. Among them there is nothing but burning. No opinions can remain. No self, no flesh can remain. Sometimes the leading ones or some of the saints are just playing. But in a coordinated church where there is the burning, all the playing will be burned out.</P><P>Second, the burning of the coordination will make you fervent, hot, and on fire! There will be no coldness or lukewarmness. Everyone will be burned and burning. When people come in they will realize that they cannot stay unless they are willing to be burned. They will say, "Do not touch these people, these people are awful; they will burn you. Even if you shake hands with them you will be burned." The coordination brings in a real burning, a real fervency. This burning will not allow you to be like Laodicea. The church in Laodicea was lukewarm, having no fervency, no burning.</P><P>Third, the burning in the coordination will produce the power and impact of the church. The impact in the local church comes out of the burning. If you desire to have an impact, you must be coordinated. You need the burning of the coordination. Then, out of your burning there will be the impact and the power. The negative things will be burned out, you will be on fire, and you will have the power with the impact.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Becoming Burning Torches</H2><P>Not only do the four living creatures look like burning coals, but they also look like burning torches. The coals are for burning, but the torches are for enlightening. From the proper coordination in the local church there will be not only the burning, but also the enlightening and shining. Whenever you touch the church you should be able to realize that there is nothing of darkness among these people. Every corner is thoroughly enlightened. Light is there. It may be that when you get into a local church, there is the sense of darkness. Nothing is clear; nothing is in the light; everything is dark and every part is under darkness. This is because the church is divided and does not have the proper coordination. If the church has the proper coordination, every corner will be under the light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having a Fire Going Up and Coming Down</H2><P>Among the coordinated living creatures, while they are the burning coals and the burning torches, there is a fire among them going up and down. This fire is God Himself. Whenever the church is properly coordinated, burning as coals and enlightening as torches, there will be the divine fire going up and coming down all the time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Walking but Running</H2><P>The living creatures, having such a coordination, being the burning coals and the burning torches, and having the fire going up and coming down, will not walk but run (1:14). They run because they have the power and the impact. In some local churches there is no running, but fighting. In others they are not fighting, they are just squatting, just sitting. The proper church is the church that runs. They run because they have the proper coordination. They run like lightning, and as they run they give people the light. In their running there is the lightning. While they run they flash the lightning. This is the proper church life. Every local church must be like this. This is the coordination and this is the proper move of the local church. Without such a coordination there is no move of a local church. The move is in the coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUSION</H2><P>These verses show us how that we may have the proper coordination. We all must learn the four kinds of walks: the straightforward walk, the backward walk, the sideways walk to the right, and the sideways walk to the left. This will give us a good coordination. Then we will be the burning coals and the shining, burning torches, and we will have God as the divine fire among us going up and coming down. This will become our power and our impact. People will see the light in our running. Wherever we go and whatever we do, we will manifest the lightning. There will be the flashing of light, causing people to be enlightened. Such a running and such a moving is the proper church life. Coordination will bring in the Lord's presence and the Lord's blessing. Furthermore, such a practice of coordination will always keep the church in a proper balance. It will prevent us from going to any extreme.</P><P>We must apply the matter of coordination not only within a local church, but also among all the local churches. We all must love to be "followers of the churches" (1 Thes. 2:14). We are one body in one move of the Lord. When one church is taking the lead in a certain direction under the leading of the Holy Spirit, we all must learn to walk backward and sideways to follow.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE HIGH AND DREADFUL WHEELS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:15-21</H1><P>After the experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, the electrum, the four faces, the eagle's wings, the man's hands, the calf's hoofs, the burning coals, the burning torches, the divine fire going up and coming down, and the lightning flashing, there is something more. Out of the experience of all these things comes the wheel. According to Ezekiel 1, by the side of every living creature there is a wheel. The wheel is so high that it is dreadful. It is dreadfully high. We all realize that a wheel is for moving, not in an ordinary way, but in a special way. When we are at home and we walk from the kitchen to our bedroom or to our living room, we do not need a wheel. But, when we travel a distance, we need a wheel. When we do something to fulfill a purpose, we need a wheel. Therefore, the move by a wheel is not an ordinary move, but a special move with a purpose. The wheel implies a move with a purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TO EXPRESS THE LORD</H2><P>The four living creatures are the manifestation and expression of the Lord in a corporate way. In every way they express the Lord. Because the Lord on the throne looks like a man, the four living creatures expressing Him also look like a man. Because the Lord on the throne looks like burning fire, the four living creatures also look like burning fire. This tells us that the living creatures are the expression of the Lord. Whatever the Lord is, they express. Because the Lord is living, they are living. The Lord Jesus is the living God, and they are the living creatures. The Lord Jesus looks like a man, and they also look like a man. The Lord Jesus looks like burning fire, and they also look like burning fire. They are the expression of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOR THE MOVE OF THE LORD</H2><P>In these verses the four living creatures are not only for the expression of the Lord, but also for the move of the Lord. The Lord Jesus moves on the earth by them. Whenever a church is proper and truly expresses the Lord, having the proper coordination with the fire going up and coming down, the move of the Lord will be with that church. If a church claims to be proper and yet has no move of the Lord, something is wrong. If there is no increase in number year after year and no growth in life among the members, it indicates there is no move with that church, and it indicates there is something wrong with that church. If a church is proper, it will have a great wheel at its side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MANIFEST TO ALL</H2><P>If a local church has a wheel, there is no need for it to claim that it has a wheel. Everyone will see its move. Its claim to having some move of the Lord may indicate that it does not actually have a move of the Lord. No one needs to declare or testify, "look at the move of the Lord among us." If there is a move, it will be manifest to all. Everyone can see the great wheel, high and terrible. The wheel is at the side of the living creatures for all to see. If we have a wheel that is high and dreadful, there is no need to claim that we have a wheel. The wheel is simply there. Every local church needs to have such a high and dreadful wheel beside it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INDIVIDUALLY AND CORPORATELY</H2><P>Not only does every proper local church need to have a wheel beside it, every proper individual believer must also have a wheel. The living creatures have several ways to move. First, they can move by flying because they have the wings of an eagle. They can also move by walking on the calf's hoofs. But these two ways of moving are simply to have an ordinary move. When they need extra power to move in a special way, they must move by a wheel. Suppose on your job you are moving daily by the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs. Your co-workers can see that you have something powerful which is strengthening you. You are able to bear things that others cannot. You are able to endure things that others cannot because you have the eagle's wings. They also can see that in your character and your behavior, you are honest, straight, frank, and sincere, having no crookedness. In their conscience, they will be convicted and convinced by you. They will see your move in such a way. They will see the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs upon you.</P><P>But in addition to this kind of move with you, there should be also another kind of move, an extraordinary kind of move, the move of a wheel. After a period of time, some of your co-workers should be caught by the Lord for the church life. The move of the Lord should be with you at your job. This is the move of a wheel. If you should work at a job for one year, two years, three years, or even ten years, and nothing happens, that indicates there is no move of the Lord with you. You are lacking a wheel. If you have the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs, you should also have a wheel. If there is no wheel with you, probably you do not have the eagle's wings. You have only the human hands. Neither do you have the calf's hoofs; rather, you have the man's crooked feet. It may be that on your job you are not such a proper human being; you are somewhat worldly, and the move of the Lord is not with you.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, wherever you go, you must have a high and dreadful wheel by you. When you move into a city, eventually there should be a wheel in that city. When you move into a country, there should be a wheel in that country. The wheel will prove that you are proper, having the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs. If you do not have the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs, you are not qualified to have a wheel standing beside you. If you would have a wheel standing beside you, you must be a proper living creature. You must experience the blowing of the Spirit as a stormy wind from the north. You must experience the overshadowing and remaining of the Spirit as the cloud. You must experience the burning of the Spirit, and you must gain much electrum. Furthermore, you must have the four faces expressing Christ in an adequate way and the eagle's wings by which you can move. You need to have the calf's hoofs to walk in a very straight, sincere way. The result will be that a high and dreadful wheel is beside you. That wheel is the move of the Lord. Consider the Apostle Paul. By reading his writings and by reading the book of Acts, we can realize that the Apostle Paul considered himself less than the least. Even his name, Paul, means little. Paul was a little man, yet with him were the eagle's wings, the calf's hoofs, and also a high and dreadful wheel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHEELS BEING UPON THE EARTH</H2><P>Let us now consider the wheels in detail. First, it says that the wheels are upon the earth (1:15). Never expect that the move of the Lord will be in the heavens. God needs a move on the earth. God needs a move in the United States, in New Zealand, in Australia, in Africa, and in Europe. He needs a move upon the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF BERYL</H2><P>Furthermore, all the wheels look like beryl (1:16). According to Daniel 10:6, beryl was the appearance of the Lord when He was moving. This reveals that within the move of the wheels is the appearance of the Lord. Wherever the wheel goes, it brings the appearance of the Lord to that place. If a wheel is with you at school or on your job, it will bring the Lord's appearance there. People will be able to see the beryl, the appearance of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING THE SAME APPEARANCE</H2><P>All four wheels have the same appearance, the same likeness (1:16). This tells us that the move of the Lord has the same likeness and appearance&#151;whether it is through us, through the church in Los Angeles, through the church in Houston, through the church in Seattle, through the church in Chicago, through the church in Toronto, through the church in Cleveland, or through the church in any other place. All the moves bear the same appearance of the Lord. Therefore, the likeness of all the wheels is the same. If the church in Houston has a likeness that is different from the church in Los Angeles something is wrong. All four wheels have the same likeness. Sometimes people in a local church think that they need to build up their own local distinction, that they need to build up something typically, uniquely local. But we must see that all four wheels bear the same likeness. Do you think that the wheel moving in New Zealand will be altogether different in appearance from the wheel that is moving in Los Angeles? Do you think that the wheel in New Zealand bears one likeness, and the wheel in the United States bears another likeness, and the wheel in Germany bears a third likeness? All must bear the same appearance. Some people might say that the churches in New Zealand are simply following the church in Los Angeles. But the church in Los Angeles must also follow the churches in New Zealand. All the local churches must be mutual followers of one another (1 Thes. 2:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DREADFULLY HIGH</H2><P>All the wheels are dreadfully high (1:18). We should never make ourselves great. We all must be little ones. The wheel beside us, however, must be so high that it is dreadful. We should not have a small wheel only two inches in diameter. In our city there must be a high wheel, dreadfully high, that will surprise all of Christianity. All the wheels must be so high that they are dreadful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING FULL OF EYES</H2><P>The high and dreadful wheel is full of eyes (1:18). According to the spiritual experience, this is absolutely correct. If a church has no move and no wheel beside it, surely that church will also be blind. If you have no move and yet you claim you have some move, you are blind. You have no eyes. On the contrary, if your church has a high and dreadful move, within that move there will be many eyes. You will have the insight and the foresight and all kinds of sight. If you are a Christian having no wheel and only knowing how to behave properly, to love your job, to love your family, to love your home, to do things well, and you do not care for the wheel, you are a blind person. If you mean business with the Lord for His move today on this earth, you will have foresight and insight and all kinds of sight. You will be full of eyes. This is why the Apostle Paul was so clear. He was clear about the present time; he was clear about the future; he was clear about the world situation; he was clear about the Word, about the church, about the physical things, the spiritual things&#151;he was clear about everything. He was a person full of eyes. Some Christians do not have even half an eye. Some of the local churches have no eyes. They are fully blinded. This is because they do not have the wheels, the move of the Lord. The more we have the move of the Lord, the more we will be enlightened. The more we move, the more we will be able to see.</P><P>During the past years I have done much traveling. I have traveled throughout China, America, and Europe. The more I traveled, the more eyes I received. The more move you have, the more you can see. In 1958 I traveled through thirty different countries. By that traveling I received many eyes; I saw many things. Do not be covered by your environment. Do not be like a frog at the bottom of a well&#151;able only to see what is directly above you in a very narrow way. You must jump out of the well and travel so that you may have more sight. The wheel is full of eyes. As it goes it sees; as it runs it sees. If it stops running, it stops seeing. The church must be like this. We see by going on. The more we go on, the more we see. It may be that today we can see only this much, but tomorrow we will go on and we will see more. If we drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles, we will see many things. But if we stop driving, we will stop seeing. We Christians must always be moving people. The church must move in order to see.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A WHEEL WITHIN A WHEEL</H2><P>Ezekiel 1:16 says that the wheel looks like a wheel within a wheel. This is very significant. When we speak of a wheel, we say that the circumference is the rim, that the center is the hub, and between these two are the spokes. Thus, you have the rim, the hub, and the spokes. But in this chapter there is no hub and there are no spokes. Rather, there is a wheel within a wheel. In James 5:17 we are told that when Elijah prayed, he prayed with prayer (Gk.); there was a prayer within his prayer. This is the wheel within a wheel. This means if the church is proper and the church is moving, that within the church's moving there will be the move of the Lord. In your move is the Lord's move. While you are moving, the Lord is moving in your moving.</P><P>The inner wheel is the source of the power for moving. The inner wheel is the motor which makes the wheel move. If your move is genuine, it must be that within your move is the move of the Lord. Every wheel has a hub which turns the wheel. If the hub stops, the wheel stops. The hub is the little wheel within the rim of the big wheel. The big wheel turns because the little wheel is being turned. In the church life, the Lord Jesus is the hub and we are the rim. The Lord Jesus is the wheel within the wheel. If the churches are not moving with the Lord, they have no way to go on because there is no wheel within the wheel. But when the churches are moving with the Lord Jesus, He becomes the wheel within the wheel. Nothing can frustrate or stop that move.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHEEL FOLLOWING THE LIVING CREATURES</H2><P>It is meaningful to see that the living creatures do not follow the wheel, but that the wheel follows the living creatures (1:19). This is in contrast to Christianity's concept which tells people to wait until the Lord moves and then they can move. I have been burdened by the Lord to tell His children that there is no need for them to wait for the Lord to move. The Lord has been waiting on you for two thousand years. Are you ready? If you will go on, the Lord will follow you. The creatures do not follow the wheels, but the wheels follow the creatures. When the creatures move, the wheels move. When the creatures stop, the wheels stop. When the creatures are lifted up, the wheels are lifted up. If we do not exercise, there will be no wheel, but if we say, "Hallelujah, let us go!" the wheels will follow us. We must have the confidence, the assurance, and the faith to go on boldly. If we go on boldly, the wheels will follow us. Do not wait for the Lord to move. The Lord has been waiting for us to move. If we will go on, the Lord will follow. Let us go and take the land! Let us go and take the country! Let us go and take the earth!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT BEING IN THE WHEEL</H2><P>Here is another wonderful point. The wheels follow the creatures and the creatures follow the Spirit, but the Spirit is in the wheels (1:20). It is hard to tell who follows whom. Hallelujah, we are following Him and He is within us. One day when we meet Him we will say, "Lord we followed You," but the Lord will say, "No, I followed you." Who can tell who followed whom? If we have the wheel with the coordination, it is really difficult to say who followed whom. We are one with the Lord, and the Lord is one with us. The Lord follows us, and we follow the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the wheels.</P><P>This is the Lord's move today on the earth; this is the Lord's recovery. Remember, we must have the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum; we must be the living creatures with the four faces, with the eagle's wings, with the calf's hoofs, with the hands of a man, having the fire burning as the coals and as the torches, and we must be coordinated as one. Then, we will have a high and dreadful wheel in our local church.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A SKY AS CLEAR AS<br>THE TERRIBLE CRYSTAL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:22-25</H1><P>These four verses are very profound and deep in their meaning. They tell us that upon the heads of the four living creatures there is the firmament or the expanse which we call the sky. The appearance of the sky is like the terrible crystal. It is so clear that it looks terrible. This sky stretches forth over the heads of all the creatures. Then it says that under this kind of sky the living creatures stretch their two wings straight. In the last chapter we saw that the straight wings are stretched forth and joined one to the other. Then it says that the four living creatures use the other two wings to cover their body. Whenever they move and whenever they act, a voice or a sound comes from the wings. The voice that comes out of their wings is like the voice of great waters and also like the voice of the Almighty, that is, the Almighty God. It is also the voice of a tumult, like the voice of an army. The word "host" here means army, so the sound is like that of an army. Furthermore, when they stop and stand still, they lower their wings. At that time a voice comes from the firmament above them. When the voice comes, they stand still; they stop and lower their wings. We must look into the spiritual significance and application of all these points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BASED ON THE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES</H2><P>We must realize that these four verses are based upon the preceding verses. Please remember that first we experience a storm with the wind blowing, which brings in the cloud of God's presence to overshadow us. As we enjoy the presence of the Lord, the cloud brings in the fire to burn us. Out of the burning fire, we gain the electrum and become a living creature. As a living creature we can then express Christ with others in a coordinated way. We have four faces to express the all-inclusive, corporate Christ. Then we must experience and enjoy the eagle's wings, that is, we must move by the divine power, the divine strength, and by the grace of Christ. We must also be able to cover ourselves, to hide ourselves, under His overshadowing wings, that is, under His grace. We must also learn how to work as a proper man by using the man's hands. Furthermore, we need to learn how to walk on the calf's straight feet, having no crookedness. Our Christian walk should be straight, frank, honest, sincere, and faithful. This will qualify us to have the proper coordination. Within the coordination, the fire will be going up and down as coals to burn us and as torches to enlighten us. At such a time, the holy God, as the consuming fire, will be among us in a corporate way, burning and moving. In addition, there will be a high and dreadful wheel beside us, meaning that we have God's move on this earth by us and with us. Within that wheel is a wheel, signifying that within our move is the Lord's move. He is moving within us and along with us. By having such a move, we will be full of eyes, having the insight and the foresight.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A CLEAR SKY, EXPANDING AND STABLE</H2><P>After we have experienced the items of the first twenty-one verses, the sky over our heads will be crystal-clear (1:22). It will be like a big expanse of crystal. We will have a wide, clear expanse above us. This means that above us is an open, clear heaven. The sky signifies the heaven.</P><P>Not only is the sky clear above our head; it is also expanding. This is very meaningful. It is not just a matter of having a clear sky, vertically, from the heaven to the earth, but it is also a matter of having a clear sky, horizontally, which means it is expanding. Our sky should be clear and expanding. Before we were saved, our heavens were dark, cloudy, foggy, and even smoggy. It was also very narrow. There was no wide expanse. There was hardly any heaven and hardly any sky. But one day we repented, confessed our sins, and accepted the Lord Jesus as our Savior. The more we confessed our sins, the more the sky was cleared up for us. After such a thorough confession, we had, for the first time, the sensation that our sky was clear. There was the sense that the day was dawning, that the clouds were leaving, and that the fog was lifting.</P><P>When we were saved, not only did we receive a clear sky, but we also received an expanding sky. We had the sensation that our sky was expanding. After being saved for some time though, perhaps some problems arose with our relatives or with the church or with some of the brothers and sisters. Immediately, our sky became somewhat cloudy again. It was not as cloudy and as dark as before we were saved, but still it was not clear. But as soon as we confessed our failures and applied His blood, condemning ourselves, our attitudes, our motives, and our intentions, right away the sky became clear once more. We came again under the clear sky. We must realize this is the open and expanding heaven to us. When we as the living creatures reach this point, we have absolutely nothing between us and God. We also have nothing cloudy between one another. There is nothing as a covering or separation between us. All the coverings, all the separations, all the clouds and fog are gone. We have a thoroughly clear sky. We have a sky that is fully expanded. Our expanse is as clear as crystal. When others look upon our clear sky, they will be astonished. It is terrible because it is so clear; it is crystal-clear and expanding.</P><P>Not only is the sky clear and expanding, but it is also stable. As a rule, the sky above the earth always has some movement. Either the clouds are moving or the wind is moving. But the sky above these living creatures is not moving. It is as stable as crystal. There is no change whatever with this sky. At the time we were saved, we enjoyed a clear sky, but only for a short time. Like the weather in Los Angeles, our skies fluctuated very much. Sometimes our sky became cloudy, but after we confessed our sins, it became clear again. This shows a real fluctuation in the sky above our head. But here, above these living creatures' heads, it is not like that. Here, the sky is like crystal, perfectly stable. There is no fluctuation in the weather. The heaven above all these living creatures is clear and expanding and stable. They have a thorough fellowship with the Lord vertically, and they also have a clear fellowship between themselves, horizontally. They have a wide and stable span of fellowship.</P><P>Every proper local church must be like this. Unfortunately though, in some local churches, it seems the sky is cloudy and narrow. It is even difficult to stretch out two arms. The sky of that poor local church is so small. There is no expanse and it is dark and very touchy. Occasionally, in some local churches it is difficult to say anything because the situation is touchy. It is easy to offend some of the dear ones. If you say this, one will be unhappy with you. If you say that, another will be unhappy with you. You dare not say anything because the situation is too touchy. In a proper local church, there must be a broad sky. There must be a clear sky that is not so touchy. No matter what you say, people would not be offended. No one would lose his temper at you. This does not mean that we need to be broad-minded. If a frog is in a well, it means little as to whether he is broad-minded or narrow-minded. We need to jump out of the well and to get into the clear sky where the horizon is so broad. Do you think there is a possibility for any of the living creatures to be narrow-minded? It is impossible, because above their heads is the wide expanse. The sky above their heads is clear, expanding, and terrible to behold. Under such a sky we have the proper fellowship with the Lord and with one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING A STRAIGHT COORDINATION</H2><P>Under a clear and expanding sky, we are enabled to have the adequate and proper coordination. Here the coordination is straight. In this chapter, the word straight is used twice. It is used once for the calf's hoofs, and it is used this time for the eagle's wings (1:23). Sometimes in the local churches, the coordination is not perfectly straight. Rather, it is slightly crooked. For example, one brother might fellowship a matter with Brother John and then tell him, "Please do not tell Brother Bill." Then he would go to Brother Bill and pass on some information and tell him, "Please do not tell Brother James." This kind of coordination is playing politics. We should never play politics. If I would say something to one brother, I must be able to say it to another. Our wings must be straight. Our coordination must be frank, sincere, earnest, and straight.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A VOICE COMING OUT OF THEIR WINGS</H2><P>As the living creatures moved, Ezekiel heard the voice of their wings (1:24). This means that as they moved in such a coordination, a voice came out. This voice was their testimony. The voice of the testimony of any local church must come out of the proper coordination. It should not be the voice of any individual believer; it should be the voice of the coordination. The voice comes out of the wings joined one to another.</P><P>Before the day of Pentecost, Peter was one who often spoke something by himself. What he spoke was nearly always rejected by the Lord. This is because he spoke something by himself (Matt. 17:4-5, 24-27). But after the Lord's ascension, on the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up with the Eleven (Acts 2:14). I do believe that when the Twelve stood there, they were like the four living creatures.</P><P>The voice which came out was not the voice of an individual Peter, but the voice of a corporate body. The four living creatures stretched their two wings for coordination and for moving and for giving the voice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO WINGS COVERING THEMSELVES</H2><P>At the same time, they used their other two wings to cover themselves. This means that in the church life, in the coordination, we all must learn to hide ourselves under the Lord's grace. Do not display yourself, but rather hide your- self. Hide under the eagle's wings. There should be no manifestation of any self or any individual. Regardless of how great our portion is, we must hide ourselves under the Lord's grace. We should never boast in ourselves, but in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AS THE SOUND OF GREAT WATERS</H2><P>Such a local church will then be qualified and adequate to sound out the voice and to give a strong testimony. The voice will not be like that of an individual person, but like the sound of great waters (1:24). We all must look to the Lord that the testimonies of all the local churches would be like the sound of great waters. One individual brother should not always speak something for the local church, but a coordinated body should sound the voice and give the testimony. People will be astonished at this kind of voice. They will say that the voice of this local church is like the sound of great waters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AS THE VOICE OF THE ALMIGHTY</H2><P>It says also that this voice is the voice of the Almighty (1:24). It becomes the voice of God Himself. It is the voice of a corporate body, but it becomes the voice of God. How marvelous!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AS THE VOICE OF AN ARMY</H2><P>Eventually the voice is that of a fighting army (1:24). Sometimes, the atmosphere in the local churches may not be like this because they do not have such a clear, expanding, and stable heaven. When they do not have a proper fellowship and coordination, they may try to vindicate themselves and claim to have something. If they have something real, they do not need to claim anything. If they are always claiming that they are rich, it indicates actually they are poor. A millionaire does not need to claim that he is rich. Only a poor beggar would claim that he has a million dollars in the bank.</P><P>Can you see this wonderful picture? Look at the expanse. Look at the move. Look at the coordination. Look at the fellowship. This is the voice of great waters, the voice of the Almighty, and the voice of an army. Please remember that this cannot be accomplished in us overnight. We must begin with the blowing wind from the north and pass through all the experiences. The experience of all these things brings us to the crystal-clear sky. All the local churches must come to this point. All must follow one another to get to this point. In the New Jerusalem there is only one way, one street. We need to follow one another to come to this one point. We need a clear sky with a wide expanse which is awesome and terrible in the eyes of other people. When we arrive at that stage, we will have a proper testimony. We will have a voice like the sound of great waters and like that of the Almighty God and like that of an army fighting the battle for God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTING DOWN THEIR WINGS<br>TO LISTEN TO GOD'S VOICE</H2><P>Notice, however, that the living creatures do not move all the time. Sometimes they stop and stand still. When they stand still, they lower their wings (1:24). When they hear a voice out of the clear sky above their heads, they stop and let down their wings. This means they know how to listen to God's voice. They know not only how to speak and sound forth their own voice, but also how to listen to God's voice. While they listen to God's voice, they stop moving, they stand still, and they lower their wings. Is this the situation in your local church? I am afraid that the local church where you are may not know how to lower their wings, to stop and listen to the voice from the sky. I am afraid that in your church there may not be the proper coordination, but rather a one-man show. The coordination of the four living creatures is not a one-man show. One person does not decide everything. It is a coordination of all the living creatures. In some of the local churches it is really like a one-man show. That one person insists that everyone and everything must be under his control. This is why that local church is weak and narrow and poor. No matter what that local church claims to have, in fact it has nothing. There is no voice from the wings.</P><P>We all must have a clear picture of what is the proper church life. The first chapter of Ezekiel has the clearest picture in the whole Bible concerning the proper church life. The coordination shown there is marvelous. All the experiences in a wonderful sequence bring the living creatures to a point that they are under a crystal-clear, expanding, and stable heaven. Thus, they have a proper move on this earth and they can give the whole universe the proper voice and testimony. Here they learn to stop and listen to God's voice. They know how to give the voice by moving and they know how to listen to God's voice by stopping. May the Lord cause all the local churches to be brought into such an experience.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE THRONE ABOVE THE CLEAR SKY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:26; Acts 24:16; 1 John 1:7, 9; Exo. 15:24-25; 24:10</H1><P>In the last chapter we saw that above the heads of the living creatures there was a clear firmament, a clear sky, that was expanding and yet exceedingly stable. The sky above their heads was so clear that it was terrible to look upon. Now we must see another point. Above this clear sky was a throne. We need to consider the meaning of the throne and to apply it to our experiences.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED OF A CLEAR SKY</H2><P>Please remember that we Christians need to maintain a clear sky with the Lord, meaning that we need always to have a clear fellowship with the Lord. We should have nothing between us and the Lord. Our sky must be crystal clear. This means that our conscience is clear and void of any offense (Acts 24:16). If we would have a clear sky, a crystal heaven before the Lord, we must have a pure conscience, a conscience without any offense. Whenever we have a particular condemnation or offense on our conscience, immediately our sky becomes cloudy, darkened, and foggy. At such a time we must confess our failure and our sin to the Lord and apply His precious blood (1 John 1:7, 9). This will give us a cleansed, pure conscience, a conscience void of offense. We will then have a clear sky and clear fellowship with the Lord. There will be nothing between us and the Lord. Sometimes a very small matter, such as a poor attitude toward our wife or husband, can cause us to have a cloud in our sky. Perhaps she is wrong, but our attitude is also wrong. Our poor attitude brings a cloud and a shadow into our sky. Right away our joy is gone. We have no peace and no anointing to pray. It even seems as if there is some kind of disease within us. Our conscience begins to condemn and bother us. What is this? This is the loss of a clear Christian sky. This is the loss of a clear heaven. We no longer have a clear heaven because something is between us and the Lord. It may remain for several days until we are forced to go to the Lord and to ask His forgiveness for our bad attitude toward our wife. By the Lord's anointing, we have the sensation that we also need to go to our dear wife and confess and apologize. This is difficult, because it is hard for a man to lose his face before a woman. We have confessed to the Lord, but now the Lord says we must go to our wife and confess. Because we consider ourselves to be a man and we hate to lose our face to a female, we would insist on not going and confessing to her. This causes us to suffer. We do not have a broad, smiling face and we cannot talk about anything with joy. When people ask us, "What is wrong?" we say, "Nothing," but really that is not the truth. In fact, there really is something wrong; there is a problem between us and our Lord. It is not only something between us and our dear wife, it is also a cloud between us and our Lord. Eventually, because we have lost the Lord's presence, we are forced to go to our dear wife and confess to her and apologize and ask her forgiveness. Praise the Lord! Right away the weather changes. Immediately the cloud is gone and the clear sky returns. Something within is once again living and jumping and we can shout, "Hallelujah!" We have a clear sky once again. We have the firmament like the terrible crystal over the heads of all the living creatures. All the living creatures are under such a clear sky. This kind of experience must be our daily life and also must be our church life. Every local church must be like this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE THRONE ABOVE THE CLEAR SKY</H2><P>Whenever we have such a clear sky in our Christian life and in our church life, we will also have the throne. Above such a clear sky is the throne (1:26). The throne is the center of this universe. The throne is where the Lord is. We may talk about having the Lord's presence, but we should never forget that with the Lord's presence, there is always His throne. Where the Lord is, there His throne is. Where His throne is, there He is. We can never have His presence apart from His throne. We know that the Lord's throne today is in the third heaven, but the Lord's throne is also within our spirit. As Christians in the local churches, we all have to be under a clear, crystal, extensive sky. We all need a clear sky. Above such a clear sky is the throne of the Lord. By having such a clear sky, we are spontaneously brought under the government of the throne. We are under the rule and reigning of the throne. We Christians should be always under this rule. Do we need policemen and law courts to rule over us? If so, this means we are not under the throne. Day and night we need to be under the throne of the Lord. Sometimes, we want to say a certain thing to others, but our sky is not clear and the throne is before us. From that throne comes forth some ruling. As we start to speak, even as the words come to the end of our tongue, the throne exercises the ruling and we are forced to swallow all the words. Sometimes we become angry with our wives and our temper rises, but the throne is before us. Right away our temper goes down. Our temper is changed into a "Hallelujah!" While we are being tempted to give our wives a long face, the throne comes in and we are forced to smile. Who rules over us? It is not even the teachings of the Bible that rule over us&#151;it is the throne. In our Christian life and in our church life, if our sky is clear, the throne will be there. But if our sky is cloudy and full of darkness, we will not see the throne. When we do not see the throne, we will be able to be loose and to do many things according to our own taste and convenience. This means there is no clear sky and no throne. Because we are under darkness, we can be loose. We can speak what we want to speak; we can express what we want to express; we can go where we desire to go. But a person who is under the throne cannot behave in that way. A person under the throne has no choice. In one sense, because we are saved we are really liberated, but in another sense we are under the throne and have no liberty. Many times I wanted to go to the department store, but when I arrived at the entrance, I could not go in because of the throne. Sometimes I forced myself to go into a few of the stores. Nevertheless, I dared not look around because the throne was still ruling. Then I told the Lord, "Lord, let me go this one time." It seemed as if the Lord said, "Okay, you go ahead." But then for three weeks I could not pray properly. I lost my clear Christian sky. That was a real punishment from the Lord to me. I said, "Lord, You gave me permission." But the Lord said, "Yes, I gave you permission&#151;to lose My presence. I will take away My presence from you for three weeks." Then I said, "Oh Lord, I just apply your blood." But the Lord replied, "Don't play with Me. My blood is not that cheap. Don't play with Me." Praise the Lord for the clear sky! Praise the Lord for the throne! Hallelujah! Above our heads is the firmament and above the firmament is the throne.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LIVING CREATURES TRANSMITTING<br>THE THRONE TO THE EARTH</H2><P>The living creatures are still on this earth, but through them the throne in the heavens is transmitted to the earth. With them and through them, the heavens with the throne are opened up to the earth. The throne in the heavens becomes one with the earth. This is like the transmission of electricity. Electricity is in the generator at the plant far from the city, but it is transmitted to us by the electrical lines. The living creatures are the heavenly electrical lines. It is through them and by them and with them that the heavenly throne is transmitted to the earth. Wherever they are, there is the throne. Wherever they go, the throne follows them. Sometimes you may go to a dear saint who is gentle, mild, and meek, yet in his presence you have the sensation that something is weighty and powerful and is ruling over the situation. You may be a very loose and sloppy person, but when you get into his presence something rules over you. What is that? That is the throne. Or you may say that is the Lord's presence. Whether you call it the Lord's presence or the throne, it is the transmission of the heavenly throne to this earth through that dear saint. You may also visit a local church where the saints are gentle, nice, and happy, yet you sense something weighty and powerful, something of authority, something ruling over everything. What is that? That, too, is the throne.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AUTHORITY NOT BEING HUMAN AND NATURAL</H2><P>In the church we should not speak of authority in a human, natural way. In the church there is no human authority. The authority in the church is the throne above the clear sky. Suppose the leading brothers or the elders in a local church are not under a clear sky, yet they would exercise authority based upon their position. That does not work. They may speak something, but there will be no weight, no ruling, because there is no throne in the clear sky. But if the elders in a local church are day and night under a clear sky, having a conscience that is pure and void of offense under the heavenly throne, with them there will be the authority. There will be no need for them to claim authority over the saints.</P><P>If you must claim authority over the saints, it means you have lost your authority. If you need to claim to have authority, it means you have no authority. When you are living under a clear sky with a throne above it, you do not need to claim to have authority, but the authority is simply there. Never try to bring people under your authority. That does not work. That is a hierarchy. That is an organization. Do not try to rule over the saints. Rather, bow down and humble yourself. Get yourself under a clear sky. It is shameful for someone to claim to be the authority in the local church. There is no such thing! In the church there is no human authority. The Lord Jesus said that whoever among you would like to be great must serve the others (Matt. 23:11). This is the way to have authority. The authority is not mine nor yours nor others'. The authority is only the throne above a clear sky. I can assure you that if we are under a clear sky with a throne above it, no opposition and no persecution can shake us or defeat us.</P><P>If the heaven above us is clear and the throne is with us, we will have the authority and we will have the weight. The words out of one brother's mouth may have power and the same words out of another brother's mouth may have nothing. Why? Because one is under the clear sky with the throne but the other is under the clouds. It is easy to learn to repeat others' words, to quote others' words. But the words out of our mouth must have some weight. It all depends upon our being under a clear sky. It depends upon being subject to the throne. This is the proper church life and this is the proper Christian life. I must repeat to all the dear ones who bear responsibility: Never exercise your authority. You do not have authority. None of us has any authority; the authority is the throne. When the people of Israel rebelled against Moses, he never exercised his authority. Moses and Aaron simply bowed down and called upon the highest authority. Then the Lord Himself came to vindicate (Num. 20:2-8). It is a big mistake to exercise authority over others in the local church. Nothing is more shameful than this. To exercise authority over the saints is shameful. It is not glorious; it is shameful. The authority is not you and not me; the authority is the Man upon the throne. We must have the Man on the throne in our clear sky. We need a clear sky with a heavenly throne. Today the Lord needs such a church life.</P><P>The Lord needs such a group of coordinated living creatures. While they are standing or walking on the earth, the heavens are opened to the earth. Through them the heavenly throne is transmitted to earth. This is the church life. Don't take a human way to exercise any kind of authority. Even if people come to you trying to recognize you as a kind of authority you must refuse it. You must tell them you are not that kind of authority. Authority does not mean that. The proper authority means a throne above a clear sky. It is not a human matter of organization and hierarchy. We must have a clear sky. It is shameful for us to intend that others should listen to us. It is shameful to have power among the saints. It is shameful to be the authority among the saints. We always consider Paul to be a great apostle, but he considered himself as less than the least of the saints (Eph. 3:8). His very name means "little." Paul would say, "You give me too great a title. I am not worthy of that."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CLEAR SKY AND THE THRONE VINDICATING</H2><P>Whether brothers and sisters would listen to you or not depends upon where you are and what you are. Are you under a clear sky? If you are under a clear sky, you do not need to argue; you do not need to claim anything; you do not need to say anything. The clear sky will vindicate. The throne above the sky will vindicate. All the local churches need this revelation. We don't have any kind of organization. We don't have any kind of hierarchy. We only have a clear sky. We only have a throne above the sky. We do not have a mission board or any other kind of board. We only have a clear sky with a throne.</P><P>I am afraid of only one thing&#151;that I would lose the presence of my Lord. Many times in my room I have told the Devil and the whole universe and myself that I am afraid of only one thing: I am afraid that I might lose the presence of the Lord. As long as I have the presence of the Lord, I am afraid of nothing. As long as I have the presence of the Lord, I care for nothing else. I only care for His presence. In other words, I only care for the clear sky with the throne above it. This is sufficient. We all have to learn this.</P><P>Some have warned me saying that I criticize and scorn Christianity too much. They say that I should not speak so negatively about Christianity. Let me tell you dear ones that it is not up to me; it is up to the speaking Spirit. I would like to be a good man, and I do know how to be good, but I cannot help it&#151;I must speak the truth concerning Christianity. What else can I do? There is a clear sky above me. The more I speak the truth according to the Spirit, the more I get a clear sky. Whenever I stand up and open my mouth, the clear sky is with me, and I have the full assurance that the throne is with me also. Praise the Lord! We are too little. We are more than unworthy, yet the Lord has visited us.</P><P>In your local church you must not care for anything except having a clear sky with the throne above it. As long as you have a clear sky with the throne above it, opposition and criticism mean nothing. The only thing you need to care for is the open heaven, the clear sky with the throne above it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE THRONE BEING IN THE LIKENESS OF<br>A SAPPHIRE STONE</H2><P>We need to see one other point about the throne. Ezekiel 1:26 says that the throne is in the likeness of a sapphire stone. From Exodus 24:10, we can understand the meaning of a sapphire stone. A sapphire stone signifies a kind of heavenly condition which exists when God is present in a situation. Exodus 24:10 shows us that when Moses, Aaron, and all the chief men of Israel saw God, they saw under His feet the appearance of a sapphire stone. That gave the people an insight into the appearance of the Lord's presence. Exodus 24 also says that at that time the heavens were exceedingly clear. God was present in that kind of situation and atmosphere. Therefore, the sapphire stone signifies the situation or the condition of the heavens with God's presence in it. The throne being in the likeness of a sapphire stone shows the presence of God in a heavenly situation. No doubt, whenever you have the throne of God in a clear heaven, the situation must be heavenly. It cannot be anything earthly or gloomy or impure. It should be heavenly, clear, clean, and absolutely transparent. This portrays what kind of situation and condition we need to have in the presence of God. Whenever we have a clear sky with God and we are in front of His throne, the situation will be like the sapphire stone. The sapphire stone is blue in color. Blue is a heavenly color indicating the situation and condition of God's presence. Whenever we have a clear sky with God's throne in it we are in a kind of heavenly situation having the appearance of a sapphire stone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUSION</H2><P>Let us again look at the picture: the Lord is upon the throne above the firmament in the heavens, and the living creatures are walking and standing upon this earth. Through them the Lord in the heavens becomes one with the earth. The heavens are connected to the earth. The heavens have been brought down to the earth. The heavens are now moving upon this earth through, by, and with all the living creatures. This must be the situation among the local churches; this must be the situation among the overcomers; this must be the situation in our daily Christian life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MAN UPON THE THRONE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:26-28; Exo. 24:10; Gen. 9:11-17; Rev. 3:21; 4:2-3; 21:19-20; 22:1; Matt. 26:64; Acts 2:36; Heb. 2:10</H1><P>I believe we all were impressed from the previous chapters that in the Christian life and in the church life we need a clear sky with a throne in it. We all need such a life, a life with a clear sky which has the throne of the Lord in it. To have a clear sky indicates that we have no clouds between us and the Lord. It means that our conscience is void of offense&#151;we have nothing between us and God and nothing between us and others. To have the throne means that we are under the ruling of the heavens. We are not free to go where we choose or to speak what we please. We are under His ruling.</P><P>In this chapter, we will consider the One Who is sitting on the throne (1:26-27). As we have seen before, He looks like a man, but He is the Lord. On the throne He looks like a man. This is absolutely different from the human and religious concept. Most of the time our concept is that the One on the throne is the almighty God. Have you ever considered that the Lord on the throne is not only the almighty God, but also a man? The One who sits on the throne is a man! Yet, the following verse says that this is the appearance of the glory of the Lord (1:28). He looks like a man on the throne. Most Christians do understand that when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was a man. They realize that from the time He was in the manger in Bethlehem to the time He was on the cross at Golgotha, He was a man. He was fully a man. But, they may never have considered that the Lord Who is on the throne today is still a man. He is a man. Although He is the Lord, the almighty God, on the throne He looks like a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD DESIRING A MAN</H2><P>I must repeat that God's intention is to have a man. God desires to have a man. Even He Himself became a man, and today on the throne He is still a man. People want to be like God, but God wants to be a man. Some Christians are always dreaming of being like God, but God desires to be like man. God's intention is to work Himself into us, making us like Him, and even the more, making Himself like us. He became a man, and He is still a man on the throne. We must be impressed that He is a man! In the book of Ezekiel, the term "son of man" is used over ninety times, indicating how much God desires to have a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRINGING MAN TO THE THRONE</H2><P>We must also see that God's intention is to work upon man in order that man can be on the throne. We would perhaps be satisfied to go to heaven, but God will not be satisfied for us merely to go to heaven. God will not be satisfied until we are on the throne. Have you ever been told that God's intention is to bring you to the throne? Some Christians might say that as long as they could stand inside the door of heaven they would be satisfied. This might satisfy them, but it will not satisfy God. Until He brings us to the throne, He will not be satisfied. God's intention is that all of us would be on the throne. In Revelation 3:21, the Lord Jesus promised the overcomers that they would sit upon His throne even as He overcame and was sitting on the throne of His Father. The Lord Jesus was saying that He became a man, and as a man He went to the throne. God's intention is to take us to the throne. God's kingdom can never come in full until we are on the throne, and God's enemy will never be subdued until we are on the throne. God's goal is not merely to deliver us out of hell, but to bring us to the throne.</P><P>This is wonderful. But, we must look at our present condition. We are sloppy and loose. It seems that in this country to be modern is to be sloppy. Young people buy a good pair of pants and then cut them off to increase their looseness and sloppiness. This kind of looseness comes from Hades. I am very happy to see that many so-called hippies have been saved. But, I feel very sorry for the hippy Christians. They have no human sensation of how to behave themselves. Even when they sit, they sit in a sloppy way. It seems the more they are relaxed and sloppy, the better. Yes, the Lord is going to take you to the throne. But are you ready to be on the throne? When you arrive at the throne, will you sit there in your sloppy way? I am not for the forms in formal Christianity, but neither am I for today's looseness and sloppiness. If you mean business as a Christian and a disciple of the Lord Jesus, you can never be loose and sloppy. I do believe that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was never loose and sloppy. He never behaved Himself in a loose way. Some of the young people have no conscience and no sensation of how to have a proper human life. They are like birds in the sky with no sensation of how to be a proper human being. How can they be on the throne?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SATAN'S REBELLION AGAINST THE THRONE</H2><P>Why does God want to bring us to the throne? It is because of the rebellion of Satan against God's throne (Isa. 14). Satan intended to exalt his throne up to the heavens, but God said He would cast him to the ground and bring his captives to the throne. God can never receive the full glory until we are brought to the throne. One day we will be brought to the throne. Then God will be able to boast to Satan. He will triumphantly declare that Satan's captives have been brought to the throne. However, you must realize that, in your present condition, you are not qualified to be on the throne. Do you look like a king? If you were weighed on the scales, I am afraid that your spiritual weight would only be half an ounce. It is a very serious matter. We are called to be the sons of God, and our destiny is to be kings, but God must work on us today to qualify us for the kingship. Praise the Lord, God has chosen us! God has called us to the throne. A strong proof that God has called us is that we are calling on the name of the Lord. God's calling is to bring us to the throne.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD JESUS<br>BEING A MAN ON THE THRONE</H2><P>Praise the Lord! We can boast that today there is a man on the throne! Before Bethlehem and before the cross, there was not a man on the throne. The Lord Jesus traveled through Bethlehem, through Nazareth, through Jerusalem, and to the hill of Golgotha. Through His resurrection and ascension He was brought to the throne. Praise the Lord! A real man whose name is Jesus is on the throne. This is why we say, "Jesus is Lord!" and this is why we say, "Lord Jesus!" God has always been the Lord, but a man has not always been the Lord. Through His resurrection in His ascension, God made this same Jesus, "both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36). Jesus was a normal man, a little Nazarene, but God made Him the Lord. God made a man the Lord. Today, the Lord of the heavens and the earth is a man! Do you really realize that the Lord of the universe today is a man, our Lord Jesus? Hallelujah for this man! It would not seem strange for us to say that Jehovah Elohim is the Lord of the universe. But, it is hard for us to see that a man who was so small that people could crucify Him, kill Him, and bury Him could be the Lord of the universe. When Judas and the multitude came to the garden, He did not run away. He willingly made Himself weak and allowed them to arrest Him and put Him on the cross. They killed Him and buried Him, but God resurrected Him. Furthermore, God raised Him up and set Him at His right hand, making Him the Lord of all the universe. Today, the Lord of the universe is a man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD JESUS<br>BEING THE PIONEER TO THE THRONE</H2><P>We also need to see that the Lord Jesus led the way to the throne. He was the pioneer cutting the path to the throne (Heb. 2:10, Gk.). But He is not the only man destined for the throne. He has cut the path in order that we may follow. He was the first one to the throne, and we will come after Him. We are marching to the throne. God is going to bring us into glory and put us on the throne.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE APPEARANCE<br>OF THE MAN ON THE THRONE</H2><P>The appearance of the man on the throne has two aspects: from His loins upward He looks like electrum, and from His loins downward He looks like fire (1:27). The upper part of a man from his loins to his head is the part of feeling, of sensation. This part signifies his nature and disposition. According to His nature and disposition, the Lord Jesus on the throne looks like electrum. The lower part of a man's body is for moving. The appearance of fire from the loins downward signifies the Lord in His move. When the Lord comes to us, He first comes as fire. When He stays with us, He becomes electrum. Whenever the Lord moves through us, He moves like fire to burn, enlighten, and search. After the burning, something will remain, and that will be electrum, a mixture of gold and silver signifying the Lamb-God, the redeeming God. God wants us to gain Him as the electrum, but He first has to come to us as fire to enlighten, to search, and to burn. Through the fire, He will become electrum to us. If we would gain Him as the electrum, we must experience Him as the burning fire.</P><P>Do you realize that nothing good dwells in us? (Rom. 7:18). We may even itemize some of the negative things that are in us: division, strife, hatred, envy, temper, self-love, self-goal, ambition, selfishness, ego, and so many other ugly, evil things. We are full of these things, but we have little of the Lord. We need the Lord to come to us and to burn out all the negative things. After we have been burned out, the redeeming God as the electrum will remain in us. No matter how clear our sky is and no matter how much we may have the throne in our sky, we need the Lord's presence as the fire, enlightening, searching, burning, and remaining as the electrum. This is the visitation of the Lord with us. This is the Lord's move with us and upon us. We are very blessed because we are under the Lord's visitation. The Lord comes to visit us as a consuming fire, and we gain Him as electrum, the redeeming God. When others are with us, they should be able to sense that we have such a God Who is the electrum.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING A RAINBOW</H2><P>As a result of having a clear sky with the throne and of experiencing a man who looks like electrum and like a consuming fire, we will have the appearance of a rainbow (1:28). A rainbow is the brightness around the man who is sitting on the throne. This brightness signifies the splendor and glory around the Lord on the throne. In order to understand the significance of the rainbow, we need to remember the rainbow at the time of Noah. During Noah's time a flood destroyed the whole earth. Only eight people were spared from that judgment. After the flood, all the human beings were afraid of being destroyed by another flood. So God made a covenant with them and said that whenever there were clouds in the heavens there would also be a rainbow with them, signifying that there would be no more flood to destroy the earth (Gen. 9:11-17). The rainbow was a sign of God's faithfulness and promise not to destroy the fallen human race. In His judgment and destruction of the fallen race, God spared some by His faithfulness. Do you realize that we all have been spared by God? We are all fallen and deserve to be destroyed, but God spared us. Praise the Lord! We are spared by His faithfulness. We have a rainbow as the sign of His faithfulness.</P><P>Although God is a holy God and a consuming God and none can exist in His presence, by His faithfulness we are spared. In a rainbow, there are six or seven different colors, but the basic colors are only three: red, yellow, and blue. When these three colors are shining and blending they produce other colors. By being mixed together, they give orange, green, and violet. It is very significant that the three main colors are red, yellow, and blue because they correspond to what we have already seen in Ezekiel. We have seen that the throne looks like a blue sapphire stone, the electrum is yellow, and the fire is red. By their refracting and shining, these three colors combine to make a rainbow.</P><P>What is the meaning of these three colors? Blue signifies the throne. According to Psalm 89:14, righteousness is the foundation of God's throne. Thus, the blue throne signifies the righteousness of God. Red signifies the sanctifying, separating, and consuming fire and refers to God's holiness. Yellow signifies God's glory in the glowing electrum. Thus we have three things: holiness, glory, and righteousness. These are the three things that keep sinners away from God. But praise the Lord! The Lord Jesus came, died on the cross, was resurrected, and is now our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). He is also now our glory. In ourselves we are short of God's glory; we are under God's righteous judgment; and we are kept away by God's holiness. But, today we are in Christ, and He becomes our righteousness, our holiness, and our glory. Today, we even bear these three things. We bear Christ as our righteousness, our holiness, and our glory. Do you realize that in God's eyes we look like righteousness, holiness, and glory? This is because we are in Christ.</P><P>This must not be simply a kind of teaching and doctrine to us. We must experience the Lord in such a way that when others contact us, they can sense the righteousness, holiness, and glory. They should be able to sense that we have a clear sky, that we have a throne, and that we are righteous and proper&#151;we are no longer sloppy and loose. We should also have the electrum with us, glowing, shining, and weighty. We all must bear the righteousness, the holiness, and the glory. Then we will have the appearance of a rainbow. All the demons, the angels, and Satan will have to come and see this rainbow. The rainbow is the sign of God's faithfulness in sparing His fallen ones. All the fallen ones have become a testimony of this. Thus every local church should bear the testimony of such a rainbow.</P><P>Even the New Jerusalem has the appearance of a rainbow. The foundation stones of the New Jerusalem are of twelve layers, each layer being a different color (Rev. 21:19-20). I read an article which stated that the twelve layers of the foundation stones had the appearance of a rainbow. So even the holy city, New Jerusalem, looks like a rainbow. We will be that holy city. We are God's spared ones. By His holiness, His righteousness, and His glory, we will have the appearance of a rainbow declaring to the whole universe God's saving faithfulness. The experience of the Christian life and the experience of the church life will consummate in such a rainbow. At the end of the whole Bible is a city whose foundation has the appearance of a rainbow and surrounds the eternal God as His strong testimony. Again I say, this must not be merely a teaching to us. This has to be wrought into us so that, as God's spared ones, we will be in the appearance of a rainbow, bearing God's testimony and declaring God's faithfulness to the whole universe. We will bear God's righteousness, God's holiness, and God's glory. Ezekiel said that this was the appearance of the glory of the Lord. When he saw this, he bowed down to the earth and heard a voice speaking to him.</P><P>If we want to hear the word of the Lord in the following chapters of Ezekiel, we all must be at this point&#151;under a clear sky in front of the throne with a Man sitting on it and bearing the flashing, reflecting, and shining rainbow. This is the place where we can hear the voice from above. This positions us to hear the voice speaking from the heavens. I hope that every one of us as individuals will be at this point, and I hope that all of the local churches will also be here. Then the Lord will have a way to speak to us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE POSITION AND CONDITION<br>OF ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 20:6; 6:9; 11:12b; 13:4-5, 17-18; 14:3, 5; 22:25-30; 3:7; 2:3-4, 6; 22:13-19</H1><P>In the Old Testament, Israel was God's chosen and elect people. God had delivered them out of Egypt and brought them into the good land. His putting the people of Israel into the good land typifies that God has put us into Christ. Our good land is Christ. Ezekiel 20:6 says that the good land is the glory of all the lands. Christ is the glory on this earth. God has put us into the glorious Christ Who is flowing with milk and honey.</P><P>The people of Israel experienced three stages of the enjoyment of Christ. In the first stage, they enjoyed Christ in Egypt as the Passover lamb with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs. In the second stage, they enjoyed Him in the wilderness as heavenly manna and as the living water. Finally, in the third stage, they enjoyed Christ as the land, full of rich produce. These three stages match our experience. When we were saved, we enjoyed Christ as the Passover lamb. Afterward, we began to enjoy Christ as our daily manna. However, the ultimate enjoyment is to enjoy Christ as the good land with all His unsearchable riches in the church life. Eventually, Israel, God's chosen people, were living in the good land with the temple and the city. The temple signifies God's house, and the city signifies God's kingdom. God's presence is in His house, and God's authority is in His kingdom. Today in the church life, we have God's presence and God's authority because we are God's elect, living in Christ and enjoying all that He is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE POSITION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL</H2><P>We need to consider the rights, the privileges, and the standing of the people of Israel. First, the people of Israel were God's elect, His chosen people. Among all the peoples of the earth, Israel was chosen by God to be His unique people.</P><P>Israel was also God's vine for the accomplishing of God's economy. God always grants His rich visitation with sunshine, air, rain, rich soil, and many other things which are necessary so that the vine can grow and produce something. The vine in God's economy should produce grapes and wine which can satisfy God and can cause people to rejoice. As God's elect and chosen people, Israel was also God's vine for His economy. Today, Christ and the church are God's vine.</P><P>Israel was also God's Bride for His satisfaction. Genesis 2:18 says that it is not good for man to be alone. Likewise, it is not good for Christ, for God, to be alone. Christ desires to have a Bride. According to Ezekiel 16 and 23, Israel was God's Bride in the Old Testament. Today the church is Christ's Bride for His satisfaction (Rev. 19:7).</P><P>The house of Israel was also God's flock. In the Old Testament, Israel was God's flock under His shepherding. Today the church is God's flock, under His care (1 Pet. 5:2).</P><P>The people of Israel were also chosen by Him to be a precious and peculiar treasure (Exo. 19:5). How marvelous was Israel's standing before God! They were His elect, His vine, His Bride, His flock, and His treasure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL</H2><P>These were the rights, privileges, and the standing of the people of Israel. But unfortunately, their actual condition was very poor. If you read the long record from chapter two to chapter twenty-four, you will weep for their condition. They were God's elect, but they became rebels against God. Many times in these twenty-three chapters, God said Israel was a rebellious nation, a rebellious house. He told Ezekiel He was sending him to a rebellious house. They were God's elect, but they became God's rebels.</P><P>They were God's vine, but they became briars and thorns (2:6). The vine should produce grapes as fruit to eat and for making wine. Instead, they became briars and thorns. They became a pricking, damaging, injuring plant which yielded no fruit and no wine.</P><P>God's Bride became a whore, a harlot (6:9). What a miserable situation! In Ezekiel 16 and 23, God said that His heart was broken because of their whorish heart. God, as a dear Husband, was grieved because of His whorish wife.</P><P>Furthermore, God's flock became scorpions (2:6). The sheep of the flock should produce milk to nourish people, wool to warm people, and meat for people to eat. But scorpions produce only continual stinging. They produce no milk, no wool, no skin, no meat&#151;only stinging.</P><P>God's treasure of gold and silver became dross, the waste material which remains from the refining of gold and silver.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATCHING TODAY'S SITUATION IN CHRISTIANITY</H2><P>The situation today in Christianity is exactly the same. Although the Christians in their standing are God's elect, they have become rebels against God. Instead of being a vine, they have become briars. Instead of being a bride, they have become a harlot. Do you believe that today's Christianity is a bride? According to Revelation 17 and 18, Christianity is not a bride, but a great harlot with many daughter harlots. She is altogether a whoredom. Neither are they a flock producing milk and wool and meat for others to enjoy. Rather, most Christians are scorpions stinging others, fighting, and quarreling. Finally, although a few Christians today may be a treasure to the Lord, most have become dross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REASONS FOR THE DEGRADATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Idolatry</H2><P>How could such a wonderful people who were God's elect, God's vine, God's Bride, God's flock, and God's treasure become the rebels, the thorns, the scorpions, the whore, and the dross? The first reason for the degradation was their idolatry. Do not consider that idols are always physical images&#151;idols are any substitutes we have for God. Whatever we love more than the Lord is an idol. A scholarship can be an idol; education can be an idol; money can be an idol; a wife, a husband, or children can be an idol. A particular style of dressing, whether it is a loose style of dressing, or a formal style of dressing, can be an idol. Whatever is more important to us than the Lord is an idol. The fall and degradation of Israel was first of all due to their idolatry.</P><P>In the New Testament, the degradation of the churches began with the loss of their first love to the Lord (Rev. 2:4). If you do not love the Lord as much as you did when you were saved, it indicates you have an idol. Whatever you love more than you love the Lord is your idol. Thus, the cause of the degradation in Israel and the cause of the degradation in the church is exactly the same.</P><P>The people of Israel worshipped idols as a substitute for God. Today most Christians have lost their first love. They love their mission work, their membership, their young people's work, their Bible studies, or their gospel work more than the Lord Himself.</P><P>Dr. A. W. Tozer, late founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, once said that if Jesus came into a conference of Christian leaders they would not recognize Him. Though they would be discussing their work for Jesus, if He were to come in, they would not know Him. His observation indicates that Christianity loves many things other than the Lord Jesus Himself. The Lord Jesus said that the church at Ephesus had many good works, yet He had something against them. They had lost their first love for Him (Rev. 2:4). This indicates they had some idols.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Association with the World</H2><P>Idols always bring people into association with the world. The people of Israel accepted the idols and through them were brought into contact with all the heathen nations. This indicates that as long as we have something within us as a substitute for the Lord, we will be associated with the world. Anything we love more than the Lord, whether money, education, a degree, a good job, a good automobile, a good house, a good living, or even a good husband, or a good wife will lead us into worldliness. Anything that we love more than the Lord Jesus will lead us into worldliness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Walking After the Manner of the Heathen</H2><P>Once the people of Israel were associated with the heathen nations, they began to walk after their manners and customs. They followed the nations. These three items are the main causes of the fall and degradation of Christianity: loving something more than the Lord Jesus, association with the world, and walking after the manner of the heathen.</P><P>I am very happy that you are in the Lord's recovery today, but I am concerned that some of you may still have an idol within you, that you may still be associated with the world, and that in your daily walk, in your way of living, you are still after the manner of the heathen. You should not be for the loose style or for the formal style. Do not pattern your life after any unbelievers. You should not say that you care only for the inner life, not for the outward appearance. We need a proper outward appearance. The way we live, the way we spend our money, and the way we dress must not be after the manner of the nations. Because we are a holy people, we must be different. It was by these three things: idolatry, association with the nations, and walking after the manner of the heathen that the people of Israel were corrupted.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FIVE KINDS OF PEOPLE</H2><P>Within the nation of Israel, there were the priests, the kings, the prophets, the elders, and the people. This long record of twenty-three chapters covers these five kinds of people.</P><P>According to Ezekiel 22:26 the priests violated the Word of God and profaned the holy things. They made no distinction between the holy and the profane, between the unclean and the clean. The Lord was profaned among them. Because they did not minister the proper Word of God, they cheated and robbed the people. They did violence to the Lord's Word. Some teachers today in Christianity minister the Lord's Word in a violent way, cheating and fooling the people by the wrong use of the Word.</P><P>Ezekiel 22:27 says that the princes, the kings, were in the midst of the land like wolves ravening the prey, shedding blood, and destroying souls for dishonest gain. They were anxious to grasp something for their own gain.</P><P>The prophets, according to Ezekiel 22:25, were like roaring lions devouring souls. They took the treasure and the precious things, causing many to be widows. Like foxes in the desert, they loved to hide and live in a desolate place. It is difficult for a fox to live in a proper house. But when a house is desolate, foxes come in. The Lord condemned the prophets because they would not fill up the gap and make up the hedge during the time of the battle. This parallels today's situation when few Christians are willing to stand in the gap for the Lord's recovery and for the Lord's interest.</P><P>During Ezekiel's time, there were false prophets who prophesied according to their own hearts. Ezekiel used a parable to describe their manner of prophesying. He said that it was like daubing the walls with untempered mortar (22:28). What does it mean to use untempered mortar? Mortar is made from lime and must be thoroughly saturated with water before it is applied to a wall. This will give properly tempered mortar. If the mortar is not thoroughly saturated with water before it is applied to the wall, a rain will wash it away and the wall will crumble. The meaning of this parable is that many prophets ministered the Word of God, but not in a properly tempered way. They were not fully saturated with the Holy Spirit and not fully soaked with the experience of life. Many preachers and teachers today are simply daubing with untempered mortar. They may give a good sermon, but when a storm comes, it is washed away like untempered mortar. A word which is fully saturated with the Spirit and with the experience of life is absolutely different. When such a word is ministered, it will strengthen God's people to withstand whatever storms may come. We need teaching that is saturated with the Spirit and soaked with the proper experience of life. This is not a matter of eloquence or a word that is pleasant to the ear. It must be real, solid, and thoroughly saturated with the Holy Spirit. This kind of word will protect, strengthen, build together, and cause us to stand against any kind of storm.</P><P>An even poorer situation existed among the daughters of the people (13:17). They not only prophesied falsely, they also prophesied when, in fact, the Lord had not spoken. Even today, this kind of prophesying occurs frequently. Many people have said, "Thus saith the Lord," but the Lord did not speak. For example, a number of people have prophesied that Los Angeles will fall into the ocean. Some even predicted the exact date, but Los Angeles is still here. This means that they said, "Thus saith the Lord," but the Lord never said that. Such false prophecies are exposed and terminated when they are not fulfilled.</P><P>The women in Ezekiel were not only prophesying falsely, but they were also practicing superstition and witchcraft. For example, they sewed on a magic band, an amulet as a superstitious protection from the demons and the Devil. They even sewed veils to hunt people. Likewise, today some pastors and preachers speak in a superstitious way, to comfort people in a false way, not according to the truth.</P><P>The Lord said that the elders had set up idols in their hearts (14:1-3), and yet they came to inquire of Him. The Lord would not be inquired of by them because of the idols in their hearts. They were not honest with the Lord. Furthermore, they were ravening and robbing, taking others' treasures into their own hands. Today's situation is very much the same.</P><P>The people, according to Ezekiel 22:29-30, used oppression and exercised robbery. They vexed the poor and needy and they oppressed the stranger wrongfully. The Lord was unable to find any one among them who could make up the hedge and stand in the gap. The situation in today's Christianity is very much the same. May the saints among us not be like these. May the Lord fully deliver us from the degraded situation in today's Christianity.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON HIS PEOPLE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 8:2-4, 10; 9:3a; 11:22-24; 10:2; 22:17-22; 14:21; 12:15; 7:21; 33:21; 3:17; 9:4; 6:8; 11:16, 17; 20:40; 17:22-23; 21:10, 27; 29:21</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BASIS OF GOD'S JUDGMENT</H2><P>First, we need to see the basis of God's judgment upon His people. God's judgment upon His people was based upon three things: His righteousness, His holiness, and His glory. In the first section of Ezekiel, in the vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord, we saw three main things. First, we saw a throne which looked like a blue sapphire, signifying the righteousness of God. We also saw the fire, which signifies God's holiness. Furthermore, we saw the glowing electrum which signifies the glory of the Lord. These three things give us three basic colors. The throne in the appearance of sapphire was blue, the fire was red, and the glowing electrum was yellow. When these three basic colors shine, reflect, and refract together, they give the appearance of the rainbow. The righteousness, the holiness, and the glory of God are the basic elements with which God exercised His judgment over His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Glory versus Idols</H2><P>In Ezekiel 2&#151;24 there are some negative things which are versus the righteousness, the holiness, and the glory of God. God's glory is contrasted with the idols in 8:2-4, 10, and in 9:3. In the vision, Ezekiel was brought to Jerusalem and entered the temple. Before him the glory of God and the idols were contrasted. On the walls were the images of the idols, and over the temple was the glory of the Lord. How could the glory of the Lord tolerate the presence of the images of the idols? Those images were called the "provoking" images because they were provoking God's jealousy (8:3). Our God is a jealous God; He will not tolerate any idols. Because of the idols in the temple, the glory of God was withdrawing step by step, leaving the temple, the city, and the people. In the last step the glory of the Lord left the temple and the city, stopping on the Mount of Olives on the east side of the city (11:23). This is the same place where the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens. The glory of the Lord stopped on the mountain and waited, but eventually it left the mountain and went back to the heavens. That was the departure of the glory of the Lord.</P><P>God's judgment upon His people is based first upon His glory. Anything that is versus His glory will provoke His judgment. I do not like to be a bad man and to speak negatively of others, but I must speak the truth. Do you not realize that today all of Christianity is under God's judgment? The whole situation in Christianity is provoking God's jealousy because it is full of idols. If you go into a Roman Catholic Church, you will see that it is full of idols. Even other so-called Christian churches also have idols. In some of the churches, you will not see physical idols, but you will see other kinds of idols. With some their work for God is an idol. With others Bible teaching or evangelism is an idol. In every corner of Christianity, there is an idol. If you love your work, your activity, or your practice more than the Lord, that is an idol. Based upon this principle, we can realize that Christianity is filled with idols. This is why I say that the situation in Christianity is provoking to God and under His judgment. God's glory cannot tolerate the idols.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Holiness versus Dross</H2><P>God's holiness is God's separation and sanctification. God's holiness is versus dross. As God's elect, Israel should have no dross, but instead be pure gold, pure silver, and a pure treasure. But God's people became dross (22:17-22). Therefore, they needed a fire to burn them. The Lord said that He would put the city of Jerusalem and the people of Israel into a furnace to burn them. What does this mean? This is God's holiness versus the dross. God's holiness cannot tolerate any kind of dross. Look at today's Christianity. Where can you find a pure treasure to God? Nearly everywhere you look there is only dross. Christianity needs the burning of God's holy fire to burn out the dross.</P><P>The love, kindness, and humility that many Christians express today with one another is a kind of dross because it is altogether according to their flesh. In their love, there is no pure gold. In their humility and kindness, there is no pure gold. It is not pure; it is a mixture; it is the flesh. Today they love, but tomorrow they hate. This means their love is not pure and holy. What they have is only the flesh doing good things and expressing something in a good way. Though it may be a good expression, it is still the flesh. There is no dealing of the cross and no dealing of God's holiness. All these things need to be burned and judged. They need God's judgment by fire. Not only does our hatred need to be burned, but also even our love needs to be burned. Not only does our pride need to be burned, but also our humility needs to be burned. Where in Christianity is any pure gold? Nearly everywhere there is only dross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Righteousness versus<br>Injustice and Oppression</H2><P>God's righteousness and justice was versus their injustice, their unrighteousness, and their oppression. During Ezekiel's time, the people used oppression and exercised robbery (22:29). That was unjust and unrighteous. On the basis of God's righteous throne, He must exercise His judgment against unrighteous and unjust things. God's judgment on His people was based upon His glory, His holiness, and His righteousness. Anything that did not match God's holiness, God's glory, and God's righteousness had to be judged.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEANS OF GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON HIS PEOPLE</H2><P>God judged His people by four terrible things: by the sword, by famine, by pestilence or disease, and by wild, noisome beasts (14:21). Ezekiel mentions clearly that some were killed by the sword. The rest, the escapees, were short of food. Others were killed by the pestilence. The remainder were devoured by the beasts. Where there is war, there is a shortage of food; war causes famine. The shortage of proper food brings in pestilence or disease. These are the means God used to exercise His judgment on His people (7:15-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Application to Today's Christianity</H2><P>How can we apply these four things to today's Christianity? Have you realized that among the Christians there is no peace, but rather always fighting and war? There is always a sword. If in a church the peace is gone, that means the sword of God's judgment has come. To have war and the sword indicates God's judgment. It means that something idolatrous, unholy, or unrighteous has brought in God's judgment. God's judgment is first by the sword. We all must be careful. If we have among us any fighting or dissenting, we should not consider that as something positive. We should realize that is God's judgment. The more we fight with one another, the more we are suffering God's judgment. Then due to the fighting, there will be the shortage of food. When a church is filled with fighting&#151;the elders are fighting one another, the deacons are fighting against the elders, the sisters are fighting against the brothers, the brothers are fighting against the sisters, the older ones are criticizing and looking down on the younger ones, and the younger ones are fighting the older ones&#151;do you believe that in such a church there could be a rich supply of spiritual food? There would be no spiritual food; rather, there would be a famine. There would be no supply, no riches of Christ, no living word, no healthy word. If we desire to have the healthy word, the supply of Christ, the rich and special spiritual food, we need the oneness. We need peace and harmony. We need for all the saints to be in the Spirit and to be one. When people come to the church meetings, they must be able to get a rich food supply. Every meeting should have an abundance of leftovers. Even the leftovers of one meeting should be enough for two other meetings. Then those two meetings will also have leftovers. If this is our condition, it means we have the rich food supply. We do not have a famine. That would be strong proof we are not under God's judgment.</P><P>Due to the shortage of spiritual food in Christianity, there are pestilences among the people&#151;all kinds of spiritual disease, weakness, and sickness. When the church life is proper there will be no disease, no pestilence. Rather, there will be health and strengthening and building up.</P><P>Furthermore, Christianity today is full of roaring, devouring, ravening beasts. Paul warned the elders from Ephesus that one day wolves would come into the church who would have no pity on the flock (Acts 20:29). They would care only for themselves and they would devour the church. It may be that even in some of the local churches there are some small wolves. Today's Christianity is characterized by these four things: there is much fighting; they have little spiritual food; they have much spiritual weakness and disease; and they are plagued by the devouring, roaring beasts. Because of these, nearly all the Christians are dead. Not many living ones are left.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESULTS OF GOD'S JUDGMENT</H2><P>As a result of God's judgment, the people of Israel first lost the good land. They were scattered, dispersed, and brought into captivity (12:15; 7:21). To lose the good land means to lose the enjoyment of Christ. They also lost the oneness. The situation in Christianity is exactly like this. Most of the Christians are deadened, scattered, and have no enjoyment of Christ.</P><P>Next, the glory of the Lord departed (9:3; 11:22-23). In the history of the people of Israel, the Lord's glory came to them twice and filled them. The first time was at Mount Sinai, when the tabernacle was erected (Exo. 40:34). The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle from that time until the time of Eli. During the time of Eli, the people of Israel fought against the Philistines with the ark in a superstitious way and were defeated (1 Sam. 4:3-10). The ark was captured, and the Lord's glory left the tabernacle. This means that the Lord gave up the tabernacle. When the temple was built at the time of Solomon, the Lord's glory came back again to fill the temple. The Lord's glory remained there until this very time when Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord departing. The glory left the temple, left the city, and rested on the Mount of Olives. Finally, the glory of the Lord went back into the heavens. The glory left. With today's Christianity, there is no glory of the Lord. Rather, there is the scattering, the captivity, and the loss of the enjoyment of Christ. There is no need to argue concerning who is right and who is wrong. Simply check as to whether the glory of the Lord is there. If you have the glory of the Lord, you are right; if you do not have the glory of the Lord, you are wrong.</P><P>The third result of God's judgment was that the temple was destroyed and the city burned. About 606 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and captured Jehoiachin, taking him back to Babylon (2 Chron. 36:9-10). At that time Ezekiel was also captured. After five years he began to see the visions recorded in chapter one of Ezekiel. In the following years he continued to see visions concerning a later capture of Jerusalem. While he was in captivity, he was brought back in the Spirit to Jerusalem to see the coming events. After Nebuchadnezzar captured Jehoiachin, he established Jehoiachin's uncle, Zedekiah, as the king over Israel (2 Chron. 36:10). But Zedekiah turned to Egypt for help and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. Then Nebuchadnezzar came back to Jerusalem, burned the city, destroyed the temple, and captured Zedekiah (2 Chron. 36:19; Jer. 52:11; Ezek. 33:21). Ezekiel saw these events in his visions before they actually happened. There were eleven years between these two captures. The city and the temple were not destroyed in the capture of Jehoiachin, but in the capture of Zedekiah. At the time of the capture of Zedekiah, the glory of the Lord left the holy city and the holy people. The temple and the city were both destroyed. That ended the history of Israel. Everything was gone. Apparently, this was the end.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S MERCY</H2><P>Though apparently everything was lost due to God's judgment, God yet showed His mercy. There was still the visitation of God's mercy. In His judgment, God still exercised His mercy. This is marvelous! Likewise, though today's Christianity is a pitiful, hopeless case, God's mercy is still there. No matter how much today's Christianity is under God's judgment, His mercy still remains there. In the midst of His judgment, God was merciful to His people and provided a number of things for them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Watchman</H2><P>First, God provided a watchman to warn the people (3:17). By reading these chapters in Ezekiel, we can see that the people of Israel were not happy with Ezekiel. Ezekiel did not seem to know how to say a pleasant word to them. In like manner, people today also condemn us, saying that we speak too many negative things about Christianity. But Ezekiel was worse. God told Ezekiel that He was sending him to a rebellious house, with hard foreheads, and stiff hearts. But He said that He would make Ezekiel's forehead harder than theirs and his heart harder than theirs, as a diamond is harder than flint (3:8-9). Today, we are not afraid of criticism from Christianity. We do not care about their criticism; we still must sound the warning and blow the trumpet. The facts are the facts. Recently, when I illustrated how some people have spoken in false tongues, I received a long letter condemning me and saying that I was mocking people. I was not mocking, but speaking the truth. If someone feels that he is being mocked, it means that he is false. If he is real, he will never feel that he is being mocked. When the policeman comes, only the robber will run away. Those who did not rob have no need to run away. If you have never spoken in a false tongue, you will not feel that I am mocking you. If you have the feeling that you are being mocked, it indicates that your speaking in tongues is not genuine. You deserve to be mocked. Today, God has established some watchmen to warn His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Marking Out His Seeking Ones</H2><P>Before God sent fire to exercise His judgment, He sent His angel to mark out His seekers (9:4). He marked out those who sighed and cried over all the sinfulness and evils in the city of Jerusalem. God told His angel to mark them out so that they would not be killed by the sword, be affected by the pestilence, be devoured by any beast, or suffer the famine. Only the marked-out ones would remain alive. Hallelujah, today it is the same! Some dear seekers have really been marked out by God. No matter how much other Christians fight, they refuse to be a part of it. The fighting among other Christians does not damage them, nor do they suffer any shortage of spiritual food, nor do they have any kind of spiritual disease. This is marvelous!</P><P>Praise the Lord that He does have some marked-out ones! At the beginning of the Lord's recovery in this country, in 1962, some brothers and I prayed day after day for all the seeking ones. We prayed that the Lord would bring the seeking ones to His recovery. Who are the seeking ones? They are the ones marked out by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Preserving a Remnant</H2><P>In the midst of God's judgment He preserved a remnant (6:8). Most were killed by the sword. Others died by the famine, by the pestilence, or by being devoured by the beasts. The rest were scattered in the captivity and preserved as a remnant. Today it is the same. Not only has God marked out the seeking ones, He has also preserved and kept a remnant. I do believe that the people who will come into the church life in this country will be the remnant, the seekers marked out by God. All those who are marked out by God will be brought into the recovery. This is the remnant.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being a Sanctuary to Them for a Little While</H2><P>God said that even in the captivity He would be a sanctuary to them for a little while (11:16, lit.). He became, not a permanent sanctuary like the one in Jerusalem, but a temporary sanctuary to all the captured, scattered people. If you tell people that Christianity has become degraded, some may argue with you by saying that they have the Lord's presence in their meetings. We must admit this fact. It is true that the Lord is a sanctuary for a little while to those in the captivity. We should not say that they do not have the real presence of the Lord at all, but we must say that it is only a temporary sanctuary. Here and there, in some of the homes, in some of the little groups, they have the Lord's presence in a temporary way as a temporary sanctuary for a little while. But no one should be satisfied with that temporary sanctuary. Rather, that temporary sanctuary should be a calling to come back to Jerusalem&#151;back to the permanent sanctuary.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Bringing Them Back to the Land</H2><P>The Lord in His mercy promised the captured ones that He would bring them back to the land (11:17). He even told them that He would bring them back to the highest mountains of Israel (20:40). We know that the high mountains typify the resurrected and ascended Christ. Today, our experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ in the local churches is very high. Our Christ is really on the highest mountains.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Predicting Christ</H2><P>Furthermore, in this section on God's judgment, in His mercy He also predicted something concerning Christ. Even in the word of judgment, Christ is predicted. In 17:22-23 there is a prediction concerning Christ. In this chapter, the house of David is likened unto a single twig. First of all, a branch of that tree, Jehoiachin, was cut off. Later, another branch, Zedekiah, was set up and was also cut off. Eventually, Ezekiel 17 tells us that on the top of that cedar tree, there was one tender twig, one tender branch, which was cropped and planted on the top of the mountain. It became a high cedar. By reading carefully, we can realize that this tender twig is Christ. Christ belongs to the house of David. Christ is a tender branch of the cedar of David who was cut off by being crucified. By His resurrection, He was planted on the mountaintop and became a great cedar tree. This was not only a kind of prophecy, but also a kind of promise given by God to the discouraged people. At that time, the house of David was fully discouraged and disappointed. But Ezekiel predicted that out of the house of David there would be a tender twig set upon the mountaintop which would become a great cedar tree. That was an encouragement and a promise to the house of David concerning Christ.</P><P>Ezekiel 21:10 is another verse which most translators believe refers to Christ. It is a difficult verse to translate, but the best rendering is, "the scepter of my son despises all trees." This is undoubtedly based on Genesis 49:10 which says something concerning the scepter of Judah. The scepter of Judah is Christ. In Ezekiel's time, the cedar tree, the house of David, was cut off and burned. Some people, however, still made mirth, being joyful, saying, "The scepter of my son despises all trees." This means that while Ezekiel was prophesying and telling the people that God was going to burn the people of Israel, including the house of David, even denying the tribe of Judah, some of them made mirth saying, "We have Christ, we have the scepter of God's Son who despises and surpasses all the trees." God's reply was that since He was going to burn everything, should they make mirth by saying this? Thus, this verse refers to Christ the scepter of Judah. It refers to the power and authority of the Son of God.</P><P>Ezekiel 21:27 then says that Christ is the One who has the right to inherit the kingdom of Israel. At that time God was overturning the kingdom and nation of Israel until the One who has the right to inherit would come. This One is Christ. Finally, in Ezekiel 29:21, Christ is the horn of the house of Israel. God will bring forth the horn of the house of Israel.</P><P>Thus, you can see while the judgment of God was on His people and while they experienced much disappointment, God prophesied that Christ was their hope and their encouragement. Although they were under the judgment of God, they should not be disappointed, but encouraged by Christ and with Christ. Even under God's judgment, they had God's mercy and God's Christ! Hallelujah for God's mercy and God's Christ!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON THE NATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 25:2-3, 7-8, 12-17; 26:2, 4, 19-20; 28:21-22, 24, 26; 29:3, 6-7, 16; 30:6, 10; 31:16, 18</H1><P>God's judgment upon the nations is covered in Ezekiel 25 through 32. According to Genesis 11, rebellious mankind sought to build the tower and city of Babel in order to concentrate themselves and make a name for themselves. The Lord then came down to exercise His judgment over the rebellious people. Babel, under the Lord's judgment, became a center of scattering, not a center of gathering. The human race was scattered from Babel as the center.</P><P>Deuteronomy 32:8 tells us that God set up the boundaries of all the nations according to the number of the people of Israel. This means that in God's economy on earth among the human race, Israel is the center. Israel is the center of the population upon earth. By looking at a map, we can see that Palestine, the good land where God put Israel, is in fact a real center on this earth. Palestine is situated at the very center of the three main continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. These three continents are the old continents where the human population began. Later, the human population spread to America and also to Australia. According to the geography of the inhabited earth, the land of Israel is right at the center. This provided a good opportunity for the spreading of the gospel. According to history, the preaching of the gospel began in Jerusalem, spread to Europe and to Egypt, and then to Asia. Afterwards, it spread to America and Australia. Thus, it was God's purpose to put His people at the very center of the human population. Furthermore, according to the prophecies concerning the coming age, the millennium, the people of Israel will be priests on the earth teaching all the nations to worship God (Isa. 61:6). Even this prophecy shows us that the center of the earth is Palestine.</P><P>At the time of Ezekiel, however, the people of Israel had become degraded and unsuitable for God's purpose. They forced God to exercise His judgment upon them and to temporarily give up Palestine as His center. God turned to Babel again and raised up King Nebuchadnezzar who built the empire of Babylon. The Babylonian empire became God's center for executing His judgment. Through Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar, God executed His judgment not only over His people Israel, but also over all the nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVEN NATIONS</H2><P>According to Ezekiel 25 through 32, seven nations were surrounding the nation of Israel. Actually, there were more nations surrounding the nation of Israel, but the record only mentions seven. This is according to the principle also followed in Revelation 2 and 3. When the Spirit spoke of the churches in Asia, He selected only seven churches (Rev. 1:11). This did not mean there were only seven churches in Asia, but that the Lord selected seven representative churches. Ezekiel did the same thing. It does not mean there were only seven nations surrounding Israel, but that the Lord selected seven nations as representative of all the nations. What were these seven nations? They were Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Divided into Three Groups</H2><P>The first four nations, Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia form one group, and Tyrus and Zidon form a second group. Egypt stands alone. We know that the nations are divided into these three groups because Ezekiel saw three separate visions at three different times concerning these groups. His first vision covered the first four nations. His second vision covered the judgment over Tyrus and Zidon. Then the third vision covered God's judgment over Egypt. Furthermore, the first two, Ammon and Moab, fit together as a pair. The third and fourth, Edom and Philistia, stand as a pair, and Tyrus and Zidon also are a pair. Only Egypt stands alone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Application for Today</H2><P>We must remember that Ezekiel was not written merely for the sake of history. We need to know the spiritual application of these seven nations to today's situation. Previously, we pointed out that the spiritual application of the noisome beast is that some evil people could be in the church as wolves (Ezek. 14:21; Acts 20:29). Based upon this principle, we have to discover the spiritual application of these seven nations. Otherwise, we will read these chapters merely as a kind of prophecy which was fulfilled in history. The Bible is not merely a book of history; it can also be applied to the church today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Ammon and Moab</H2><P>Ammon and Moab were two brothers who were born of Lot by his daughters. Their origin was an ugly, evil thing. Yet Lot was a relative of Abraham, the first forefather of the people of Israel. It is not an easy thing to apply all these pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, but by considering the whole context of the Bible we can get a proper application. According to these verses in Ezekiel, Ammon offended God. First, when the sanctuary of God was profaned, they were happy. They said, "Aha" when the sanctuary was profaned (25:2-3). Secondly, when the holy land of God was made desolate, the Ammonites were also happy. Finally, when the house of Judah was carried away into captivity, the Ammonites were again happy. They were happy about three things: the sanctuary being profaned, the good land being made desolate, and the house of Judah being carried away. This means that they hated the sanctuary, they hated the holy land, and they hated the house of Judah. The sanctuary was a type of the incarnated Christ tabernacling on this earth as God's dwelling place, God's sanctuary (John 1:14). The good land signifies Christ with all of His riches and grace that God has given us. The house of Judah, according to typology, signifies the church. Thus, the sanctuary signifies Christ, the good land signifies God's rich grace in Christ, and the house of Judah signifies the church.</P><P>Some people on the earth, represented by the Ammonites, hate Christ, they hate the grace God gives in Christ, and they hate the church. Do you understand? Who are today's Ammonites? They are the people who hate Christ, who hate God's grace, and who hate the church. During the first two centuries A.D. the Roman Empire was a kind of Ammonite. The Roman Empire hated the incarnated Christ, the very tabernacle as God's sanctuary on the earth and it hated the grace that God gave to His people. The Roman Empire also hated the church. Even today these kinds of persons are on the earth. In this country, in your city, even in your neighborhood are some Ammonites.</P><P>What about the Moabites? The Moabites said, "Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen" (25:8). The Moabites were happy to say that Jerusalem was no longer separated from the nations. This signifies the kind of person who likes to bring the church into an association with the world. They like to make the church the same as the world. During the first two centuries of the church, the Roman Empire was an Ammonite, hating Christ, God's grace, and the church. Then a Roman Emperor, Constantine, came in not as an Ammonite but as a Moabite. He brought the church into the world, making the church nearly the same as the nations. Today the situation is still the same. Some Ammonites hate the church, but some Moabites come into the church and do their best to make the church associated with the world and to make the church the same as the world. Though Ammon and Moab were brothers, what they did toward the people of Israel was very different. Today we still have these two kinds of people. I am afraid that even in some of the local churches some might be used by Satan as a Moabite to bring the church into the world and to make the church associated with the world. They want the church to be the same as the heathen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Edom and Philistia</H2><P>Like Ammon and Moab, Edom was also closely related to Israel. Edom was the son of Esau, the brother of Jacob. Thus, according to blood, Edom and the sons of Israel were cousins. What is the meaning of Edom? Edom signifies the old man. Edom signifies us. Our unregenerated old man is Edom and our regenerated new man is Israel. According to the record of Ezekiel, Edom was full of hatred toward Israel, continually seeking revenge and vengeance. We are the same. Our old man hates the church. You may say, "I love the church." I believe that you do love the church, but sometimes you also hate the church. Have you not discovered that you are two men? On the one hand you are a real Israelite loving the church, and on the other hand you are a real Edomite hating the church. Sometimes you love the church and you love all the leading ones. At other times you hate the church and you hate all the elders. You do have the nature of Edom within you.</P><P>Along with Edom is Philistia. In order to know the Philistines, we must study Judges and 1 Samuel. The Philistines were even closer to Israel than the Edomites. They lived very close to the good land and even mingled with the Israelites. Many times the Philistines came to the people of Israel and intervened in their worship to God.</P><P>Once the ark was captured by the Philistines. The Philistines typify you and me as the natural man. We have the old man, and we also have the natural man. The natural man is more difficult to recognize than the old man. Let me illustrate the difference between the natural man and the old man. Suppose that there are three elders in a local church. They all love the Lord, but when one of them becomes the leading one, the other two brothers react. Their reaction is an expression of the old man.</P><P>What about the natural man? The natural man may be illustrated in this way. Once a brother becomes the leading elder, he would endeavor to do many things for the church. He would exercise his wisdom, his human power, and his capabilities. He would play politics, maneuver situations and exercise control to work things out. This is the natural man. The elders' meetings become simply a meeting of the old man with the natural man. This damages the church life. Some of the churches can hardly go on because they are frustrated by the old man and the natural man of the leadership. We are not afraid of the Ammonites. We are a little afraid of the Moabites. But our real concern today is the Edomites and Philistines. The Edomites and the Philistines do the most damage to the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Tyrus and Zidon</H2><P>Tyrus typifies people who are seeking worldly wealth. They are seeking to be rich and to make money. They will sacrifice everything related to the Lord for the sake of their business. They do not care for the Lord's interests; they only care for their wealth, their riches, and their business. People of Tyrus may be found among unbelievers and also among believers. Some of your relatives, your cousins, your in-laws, your classmates, and your friends are people of Tyrus. If you talk to them concerning the church, the Lord's testimony, or Christ, they cannot understand what you are talking about. They only want to know if this will help them make a better living and help them become richer or get a higher degree or a higher position. Many of the Jewish people today are endeavoring for these two things: position and wealth. One Jewish person told me it is better to have both a degree and wealth. These are the people of Tyrus. Some real Christians are also people of Tyrus. When you speak to them concerning the Lord's recovery, they think you are foolish. They think you spend too much time going to the meetings, too much time fellowshipping, and too much time reading the Bible. They think you do not care enough for your degree, for your business, and for your money. This means they also are people of Tyrus.</P><P>Tyrus said Jerusalem was going to fall. They were happy that Jerusalem was going to fall (26:2). All the people who are seeking the world's wealth would be happy to see the church terminated. They would be happy if the meeting hall doors were permanently closed. They would tell you that you are wasting your time going to the meetings. Perhaps even among the local churches today, there are some with this attitude who attend the meetings. They feel they need to study and get a higher degree and that they need to make more money. They do not care for the church or the Lord's interest. They only care for riches, for wealth, for a position, and for their business. When they hear of some who backslide, they are happy.</P><P>Along with Tyrus is Zidon. Ezekiel says that Zidon was a pricking brier and a grieving thorn to the house of Israel (28:24). After Tyrus comes Zidon, the brier that pricks and grieves. In Matthew 13:22 Jesus said that the deceitfulness of riches and the cares of this world are like thorns which choke the growth of life. If Tyrus is present, Zidon is close by. If many among the saints are of Tyrus, many of Zidon will also come out. This means if the saints are loving the world and riches, they will become briers. Many Christians today have simply become briers and thorns which prick and grieve and damage the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Egypt</H2><P>Egypt is somewhat easy to apply. According to the Bible, Egypt is a nation that does not depend upon God, but rather upon its own resources. Egypt had the Nile River as the source of all its riches. Thus, they did not depend upon the rains from heaven; they depended upon the water from their Nile. They exercised their wisdom to develop their natural resources so that they became rich and had a rich supply. Whenever the people of Israel were short of food, they went down to Egypt for a supply. Thus, Egypt represents a person who is exercising natural wisdom to develop his natural resources to be rich and to have a supply. At the time of Ezekiel, Israel turned to Egypt and leaned upon Egypt, trusting in Egypt as a staff. But the Lord said that Egypt was a staff made of a reed, easy to break (29:2-9).</P><P>In summary, there are seven kinds of people who can damage the church life. Some are against the church, hating Christ, hating God's salvation, and hating God's grace. Those are the Ammonites. Others creep into the church and gradually bring the church into association with the world, making the church the same as the world, making no difference between the church and the world. These are the Moabites. There is Edom representing the old man, and there is Philistia representing the natural man interfering with the things related to God. There is also Tyrus representing the people who are seeking the riches of the world. Following these are the people of Zidon who become the briers and thorns to the church due to the seeking of riches. Last, are the Egyptians who seek the worldly riches by developing their own resources to be rich in supply and so that they might become a source of supply for others and become independent of God. These are the different persons who can damage the church life. We all must be on the alert that none of us would become this kind of person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S JUDGMENT OVER THE NATIONS</H2><P>How did God exercise His judgment over the nations? First, God destroyed them. Second, God made them desolate. Third, God made them very low. Fourth, all these enemies were delivered to the nether parts of the earth, that is, the lower parts of the earth (31:14). Where are all the soldiers of the Roman Empire who hated the church? They are in the nether parts of the earth. Do not be afraid of a strong persecutor of the church. After a few years he will die and go to the nether parts of the earth, to Hades.</P><P>If we do not deal with our old man, God will exercise His judgment upon us. He will cause us to become very low and very down in our spirit. If we judge our old man, not caring whether we are first, second or last, not caring whether we are an elder or have any position, we will be so happy in the church life and our spirit will be very high. Our spirit will not be down. To be down means to be under a kind of judgment. If we are down, low in our spirit, we are under God's judgment. Sometimes, God would even destroy us and make us desolate. When we are desolate, we have nothing fresh, nothing new, nothing living, nothing growing, nothing built up&#151;we are like a desert. We become desolate when we go along with our natural man. The more we exercise our natural wisdom, the more we will be desolate. But if we will judge our natural man, we will see that our spirit will be fresh, living, green, flourishing, and growing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESULT OF GOD'S JUDGMENT<br>UPON THE NATIONS</H2><P>The result of God's judgment upon the nations was that all the nations knew that He was the Lord. More than sixty times in the book of Ezekiel this sentence is repeated&#151;"That they may know I am the Lord. I will destroy them that they may know I am the Lord, I will make them desolate that they may know I am the Lord. I will make them low that they may know I am the Lord. I will put them into the nether parts of the earth that they may know I am the Lord" (25:7, 11, 17; 26:6; 29:6). I do believe that all the sinners and all the opposers including the Emperor Nero, Mussolini, and Hitler are in the nether parts of the earth knowing that Jesus is the Lord. It may be that some persecutors are still living, but sooner or later God will put them into the nether parts of the earth. Then they will know that Jesus is the Lord. The eventual result of God's judgment upon the nations was that God's purpose was carried out and fulfilled.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S RECOVERY BY LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 33:7, 11; 34:11-16, 23-31</H1><P>In the last chapter we saw that God's judgment was upon seven nations surrounding the nation of Israel. He judged Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt. The dates of Ezekiel's visions are very significant. In chapter twenty-six, he saw the vision concerning Tyrus in the eleventh year, and then in chapter twenty-nine he saw the vision of Egypt in the tenth year. This means that Ezekiel did not keep the record according to the date, but according to the meaning. He wrote, not according to the sequence of history, but according to the sequence of meaning. According to the meaning, Tyrus has to come first, then Egypt, though in fact he saw the vision concerning Egypt earlier than that concerning Tyrus. This is strong proof that all seven nations are very meaningful and that they were put together as a record, not according to the historical events, but according to their meaning.</P><P>Clearly, the first four nations form one group, and the last three form another group. These last three are mainly related to worldly wealth and natural resources. Tyrus represents the wealth and riches of the world which damage the church life. No matter how much we say that we love the church, if we are attracted to the wealth and riches of the world, we will damage the church life. We all must look to the Lord that in the local churches none of us would ever care for worldly riches. We must be people who prefer to be poor, rather than to care for the riches of this world.</P><P>Out of the caring for worldly riches comes the pricking briers and grieving thorns. This is strongly and clearly proved by the Lord's parable in Matthew 13. The local church is like a farm and in 1 Corinthians 3, we see that the farm is growing something. Briers and thorns choke the growth of proper plants on the farm. In the local church we must look to the Lord that none of us will care for the world's wealth and riches. If we care for riches, we will choke others' growth.</P><P>The last nation is Egypt, which is closely related to Tyrus and Zidon and represents the development of the natural resources which are raised for others to trust in. Whenever the people of God become poor and lack food, they always put their trust in Egypt. But God said Egypt was a staff made of reeds and was not strong enough to trust in (29:6-7). If you trust in Egypt, you will hurt yourself. This indicates that natural resources are not trustworthy. Even many worldly people realize that natural resources are not trustworthy. If you put your trust in riches and the development of the natural resources, you will be a damage to the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY BY LIFE</H2><P>We have to realize that God's judgment is always purposeful. His purpose in judgment is to bring in recovery. God does not exercise and execute His judgment without a purpose, without intending to recover something.</P><P>Let us remember that God's judgment is based upon His righteous throne, upon His holiness, and upon His glory. Whenever the condition among God's people or in the world does not match these three aspects, He will exercise His judgment for the purpose of recovery. God wants to recover His people according to His glory, His holiness, and His righteousness. His recovery is by life. The judgment of God is by fire, but the recovery of God is by life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Setting the Watchman</H2><P>In the Lord's recovery by life, the first thing He does is set the watchman. What is a watchman? A watchman is one who has been commissioned by God to give people a warning, to sound the trumpet, to cause God's people to turn to Him and to repent. The principle is the same in the New Testament where God sent John the Baptist as a great watchman. When John the Baptist came, he sounded the trumpet of repentance. He cried "Repent!" (Matt. 3:1-2). Ezekiel voiced the same thing in principle when he warned the people to turn from their evil ways. God did not desire for them to die; His desire was for them to turn and live. Ezekiel and John the Baptist both sounded the trumpet of repentance, warning the people to turn from their evil ways.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Coming to Be a Shepherd</H2><P>After setting the watchman, God Himself came in to be the Shepherd. This is wonderful! After John the Baptist sounded the trumpet of repentance, the Lord Jesus also came in as the Shepherd (Matt. 9; Luke 15; John 10). In His recovery by life, God first sends the watchman to warn His people to repent, to turn and live. Following this, the Lord Himself appears as the Shepherd. In our personal experience, it is exactly the same. First, we may hear a warning from the Lord causing us to turn and repent. At that time we realize that the Lord Jesus is not only our Savior but also our Shepherd, seeking and searching us out. After the warning of the watchman, God came in as the Shepherd to search and seek out. God did not send an angel or some other person, but He Himself became the Shepherd.</P><P>As the Shepherd He first of all searched. Because of the fall of man, we all were buried under many evil things, so we needed God to search for us. In Luke chapter fifteen there is both the shepherd seeking the lost sheep and the woman lighting the lamp and searching within the house for the lost coin. The prodigal son then was drawn home by the searching of the Spirit of the Lord. Many times the Lord has done the same thing with us. He searched for us so that He could save and recover us. Before we were saved, we were buried under many sins, but the Lord Jesus sought us. Then after we were saved, we backslid into poor Christianity, and were buried under many doctrines, forms, and gifts, but the Lord Jesus once more searched for us and eventually brought us out. We are the ones who have been sought out by the Lord Jesus as the Shepherd. How is it possible for us to be here in the church life? It is not of us; it is of Him. We are here because He as the Shepherd searched for us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Bringing Them Out of the Nations</H2><P>When we were fallen as sinners or when we became backsliders, we were among the nations living like Gentiles. Though we were living like unbelievers among the millions of people on earth, the Lord Jesus sought us out and brought us back. You may have been one schoolteacher among forty or fifty or even a hundred teachers, but you alone were sought out and brought back by the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus caused you to be different from the Gentiles. Formerly, you were the same as the unbelievers. Whatever they did, you did also. But one day, the Lord Jesus as the Shepherd sought you and brought you out from among the unbelievers. Hallelujah!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Bringing Them Back to Himself</H2><P>God promised that He would bring His people back to their own land (34:13). They were in captivity in heathen countries, but the Lord promised to bring them back to their own country, to the good land of Canaan. We know that to us the good land is Christ. Before we were saved or after we backslid, we were separated from Christ. But the Lord sought us out and brought us back to Himself. Today we are in Christ, in the good land. The good land today is also the local church. When we were brought back to Christ, we were brought back also to the local church. It is here that we have all the riches and enjoyment of the good land.</P><P>The Lord promised to bring them back, not merely to the level of the plains, but to the high mountains. This means that the Lord Jesus brings us back to experience the resurrected and ascended Christ. Today in the Lord's recovery, we do not enjoy a Christ merely on the level of the plain; we are enjoying Him on the highest mountains as the resurrected and ascended Christ. Our enjoyment of Christ is so high! How marvelous!</P><P>Furthermore, the Lord said He would bring them back to the rivers (34:13). The rivers indicate the life-giving Spirit, the living water of the Spirit. From the mountains, the rivers flow; from the resurrected and ascended Christ, the living water of the Spirit flows.</P><P>The Lord also said that He would feed His flock by the rivers (34:13). In the local churches the Lord Jesus is feeding us daily by the rivers of living water. Many of us have had this sensation. While we were in the denominations, we only had the sensation of dryness and drought. But once we came into the meetings of the local churches, we had the sensation that we had been brought back to the river. Something was flowing there as a river and we were by the side of the river enjoying the riches of Christ. This is not something of man; this is something of our Shepherd. He feeds us richly by the rivers. In all the meetings of the local churches we have the river, the flow, and the watering. It is not a matter of teaching or ministering, but a matter of something flowing and of being watered. When we come into the meetings we can sense this watering.</P><P>The Lord brought them back, not only to the rivers, but also to the good and fat pastures (34:14). The rivers signify the life-giving Spirit and the pasture signifies Christ. By the rivers we have the rich Christ as our pasture. The rivers are for drinking and the pasture is for eating. In every meeting of the local churches, we have the sensation that we are by the rivers and in the pasture, that we are drinking and eating. Praise the Lord we are under the care of our Shepherd, drinking by the rivers and feeding in the pastures! If visitors could come to your local church and not have the sensation that they were under the feeding and watering with a river flowing, with pastures fat and good and green, this would mean that the church life there is wrong. If the church life is right, when people come to the meetings, they will have the sensation that they are by the flowing rivers and in the fat pastures.</P><P>Ezekiel 34:15 also says that the Shepherd will cause them to lie down. To lie down means not to work so much, not to struggle so much, not to strive. In the Bible, to lie down means to rest. In Song of Songs 1:7, the seeker asked the Lord where He fed His sheep, where He gave His flock rest at noontime. Whenever the Lord feeds us, shepherds us, gives us to drink and eat, He also gives us rest. Many times in the church meetings, we have the sensation that we are lying down to rest. Outwardly we are sitting, but inwardly we are lying down to rest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Binding Those That Were Broken</H2><P>The Shepherd will also bind those who were broken, and He will strengthen and heal those who were sick (34:16). How we need the binding and healing! Frequently in the church meetings we have the sensation that we are under the tender binding of the Lord. We have the sensation that some of our wounds and breaks are under the Lord's binding, healing, and strengthening. While we are eating, drinking, and resting, we are under His binding, strengthening, and healing. Praise the Lord!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Setting Up a Shepherd over Them</H2><P>The Lord also promised that He would set up a shepherd over them (34:23). This was His servant David, who was a type of Christ as our Shepherd. The Lord Jesus always takes care of us. We should not worry about our problems, how to make a living and so forth. Jesus, our Shepherd, is taking care of us. Believe me, He is taking care of us! We must learn to put our trust in Him. It is so good after the whole day and after the night's meeting to simply tell the Lord, "Thank You Lord, I am under Your care; now I am going to sleep. Come and take care of me." Such a simple prayer is good enough. When you wake up in the morning you may say again, "Thank You Lord, I am still under Your care." There is no need to be so religious, asking the Lord to protect you and to do this and do that. The Lord would say, "Stupid child, I know what you need. Don't waste your time. Don't burden me with this kind of prayer. Just enjoy My care." He is our Shepherd. I could give many testimonies of how I have enjoyed His care during these past years. Wherever I went and worked, I was under His care. He cared for me! Hallelujah! We are under His care! He is our Shepherd. I rejoice that we are under His care. We are not a flock without a Shepherd. In His recovery, as His flock, we are under His shepherding. As He cares for us and feeds us, we have the real experience of Psalm 23. The Lord is our Shepherd; we have no want. Learn to experience the Lord Jesus as your Shepherd.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Enjoying Peace and Liberty<br>under His Shepherding</H2><P>According to Ezekiel 34:25, all the evil beasts will be kept away from His recovered people. In the proper church life there are no wolves, only lambs. In the Lord's recovery, all the evil beasts are gone.</P><P>The Lord also promised to break all the yokes (34:27). With Him there is no bondage and no yoke. Jesus breaks every fetter; Jesus sets us free! In the local church there is no yoke, but rather full liberty and full release. Furthermore, under His shepherding the Lord delivers us from all kinds of slavery. In the churches, there is no sensation that we are under a kind of slavery. Rather, there is the sensation of liberty.</P><P>Furthermore, the Lord promised that His people in His recovery would never be a prey to the enemy (34:28). This means that they would never be defeated or captured by the enemy. In the local churches we share the spoil of the Lord's victory. We are not here struggling to win the victory; we are here enjoying the victory of the Lord.</P><P>Eventually, the Lord promised that all those in the Lord's recovery would dwell in peace and safety (34:28). In these portions of the word are the phrase "lie down" and the word "sleep" (34:15, 25). It does not mean to sleep in a bedroom, but to sleep in the woods. Under the Lord's shepherding, it is safe to sleep even in the woods. I never dared to sleep in the woods. Sometimes while on vacation, people invited me to sleep in the woods, but I begged them, "Please don't put me out there. I'm afraid of the lions, the tigers, the scorpions, the snakes. Don't put me in the woods. I would rather be under a roof." But here it says they could even sleep in the woods. There is no need to be afraid of anything in the Lord's recovery. If you go to a local church where you have to be careful because the situation is touchy and you are afraid, that must not be a proper local church in the Lord's recovery. In the proper church life in the Lord's recovery, there is nothing for you to be afraid of. There is the sensation of safety. At every corner of the church life, you are safe. There should never be a situation in the church life that causes you to be fearful. You should never be afraid to talk to an elder, or to talk to the sisters. Some have asked me why I can be so frank in my speaking. It is because in the Lord's recovery we have safety and peace. I do not fear to speak frankly because this is the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Making Them a Blessing</H2><P>The Lord promised that He would make them a blessing (34:26). He also promised them that there would be showers all the time, that there would be the timely rain (34:26). They would have no lack of water. We need not only the rivers, but also the showers from the Lord. Frequently, in the local church meetings we have the sensation that something is not only flowing, but also coming down like a shower as well. Sometimes even at home after the meeting, we have the sensation that the showers are still coming down upon us. This is the strongest sign that the Lord's blessing is upon the local church. He gives us showers of blessing in season, so timely. The showers will cause all the trees to yield their fruit and cause the herbs to yield their rich produce (34:27). The churches then will be rich with spiritual food. All the produce, the increase of the earth, is good for food. In the local churches, there is no famine, no shortage of spiritual food. Sometimes before a meeting there are only five small loaves, but after the meeting twelve baskets are left over. Hallelujah! This is the real blessing. These are signs that the local churches are under the Lord's blessing: the showers in season, the trees yielding fruits, and much produce from the good land. We should never have the sensation that the local church meetings are short of food. If we are short of food, we are wrong. If we are really in the Lord's recovery, we will be rich in food. In 34:29 the Lord promised to raise up a plant of renown, whose fruit would be for their enjoyment. Again, this is Christ as the rich food supply.</P><P>Finally, the Lord said He would be with them, that they would be His people, and that He would be their God (34:30-31). This is fellowship in the oneness. This is the mingling of God with us. In the Lord's recovery we have God's presence. God is with us and we are His people and He is our God. We have such a fellowship and such a oneness. We are one with God, and God is one with us. The church is a real mingling of God and man. The recovery of the church life is not a matter of teachings, gifts, or other things, but a matter of the Lord's presence. We are here on earth enjoying such a mingling. Hallelujah for the Lord's recovery by life!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE OUTWARD AND INWARD<br>RECOVERY BY LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 35:10-15; 36:8-12, 15, 22-30, 33-38</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JUDGING THE OLD MAN AGAIN</H2><P>The Lord's recovery of His people is by life. In Ezekiel 33, God set up a watchman. In Ezekiel 34, God Himself came in to be the Shepherd, to search for His people, to seek them out, to bring them back, and to cause them to enjoy all the riches of Christ. Following this, in Ezekiel 35, the Lord reminded us once more of the need to condemn our old man, speaking a second time concerning the judgment of God upon Edom. In the previous section, Edom was judged, but because the old man is very difficult to deal with, the judgment had to be repeated. It may be that yesterday you condemned your old man, and you received judgment upon it. But this morning your old man has returned to pay you a nice, subtle visit. You had been recovered and brought back to the good land into the rich enjoyment of Christ. You thought your old man was fully condemned and judged yesterday, but you did not realize that he came back without giving you any notice. He came in without knocking and is with you this morning. While you are in the enjoyment of Christ, he is still with you hating everything of God, God's Word, and God's people.</P><P>Several times in Ezekiel 35, it says that Edom and his company were happy to see Israel desolate (35:12, 15). They were waiting to possess the two nations of Israel and Judah, claiming them as their own. To the Lord, of course, they were speaking nonsense, because He was going to exercise His judgment over them again.</P><P>We must learn this lesson. While we are being recovered, we have to judge our old man again and again. The judgment upon Ammon, Moab, Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt may be once for all. But the judgment upon Edom cannot be once for all. Our old man must be judged repeatedly until the day of the redemption of our body. This is the reason that between Ezekiel 34 and 36 which are so wonderful and so positive, there is a black chapter. Ezekiel 35 is really black because the judgment upon Edom comes once more. The judgment must be repeated because Edom has returned. Although you condemned him, judged him, and chased him away, he is back. Therefore, you must cooperate to exercise God's judgment once more upon the old man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE GOOD LAND</H2><P>Ezekiel 36:8-12, 15 promises the recovery of the good land, the restoration of the full enjoyment of the riches of Christ. Whenever we backslide, we lose the rich enjoyment of Christ. Although we can never lose Christ Himself, we can lose our enjoyment of Him. Christ Himself is rich, yet we may lose the enjoyment of His riches. Praise the Lord! In the Lord's recovery, there is the restoration of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INWARD RECOVERY</H2><P>In the Lord's recovery there are always two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect. By way of illustration, let us suppose that you had fallen away from Christ, away from the church life, and away from the fellowship with the brothers, that you had become involved with gambling, sports, or other sinful, worldly things. But one day the Lord sought you, brought you back to Himself, and restored your fellowship with the saints. This is the outward aspect of the Lord's recovery. At the same time, however, the Lord would also do an inward work. He not only would bring you back to the good land, He would also recover you inwardly. The second part of Ezekiel 36 shows the inward aspect of the Lord's recovery. To be recovered back to the church life and back to the fellowship with Christ is only the outward aspect. You still need the inward aspect of the Lord's recovery which is covered in 36:22-30.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WASHING WITH CLEAN WATER</H2><P>Not only has the Lord brought us back to the enjoyment of Christ, but He has also washed us. Zechariah 13:1 says that the Lord's blood is a washing fountain. Likewise, the clean water in Ezekiel 36:25 refers to the Lord's redeeming and cleansing blood. The Lord Jesus washes us with His cleansing blood, not only when we are saved, but also every time we are revived and brought back to Him.</P><P>The Lord washes us from two categories of dirty things: from filthiness and from idols. Filthiness includes sinful, unjust, unrighteous, and all kinds of dark things. It also includes hating others, wrong doings toward others, gambling, going to movies, and sinful amusements. At the time we were saved, we felt ashamed of all those ugly, dirty activities. The Lord's blood as the cleansing water washes us from all our filthiness. We need to be washed from gossip, from spreading rumors, from jealousy, from criticism, and from all unkindness. Regardless of how filthy we are, the Lord's blood is like clean water which is able to wash and cleanse us.</P><P>Not only did we have a lot of filthiness, we also kept many idols. Consider how many idols you had before you were either saved or revived. Perhaps you even tried to bring some of them into the church life. How many idols do you have presently? To some ladies, even a piece of clothing can be an idol. They may love that piece of clothing much more than they love the Lord Jesus.</P><P>Once, while Brother Watchman Nee was ministering in Shanghai, he suddenly pointed to a certain sister and asked, "How many chapters are there in Matthew?" She answered, "Twenty-six." Then Brother Nee asked once more, "How many buttons are on your long gown?" Without hesitation, she told him the correct number. She did not realize Brother Nee's intention and neither did we. But eventually, we all were clear. Brother Nee responded, "You see, you see, you know your long gown so well, even as to how many buttons it has, but you don't know how many chapters there are in Matthew!" That little illustration by Brother Nee put all of us into a corner. Many Christians have never dropped a single tear for the Lord Jesus, but they have wept many tears for their clothing. This proves they love those things more than they love the Lord Jesus. Some Christians only care to get a doctorate, to have a position, to have fame, or to make themselves a name. All these are idols. The Lord's blood cleanses us not only from our filthiness, but also from our idols. This cleansing with the blood as the clean water is on the negative side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A New Heart and a New Spirit</H2><P>On the positive side, after the cleansing, God gives us a new heart and a new spirit. While many of you had been in Christianity for years, I am afraid that you had never heard a message telling you that you have a human spirit. You heard many messages, but none of these told you that at your conversion the Lord gave you a new heart and a new spirit. You must realize that there is a difference between the heart and the spirit. Once, when I was ministering in Las Vegas, a sister was greatly bothered because I said that to have a loving heart is not enough. In tears she asked me, "What do you mean that a loving heart is not enough?" To illustrate to her, I asked her if she loved a certain Bible which belonged to her husband. When she assured me that she did love it, I said, "Okay, please take it." As she stretched out her hand to take it, I said, "Do not use your hand. Just use your loving heart. Take it by your heart." By this example she saw that having a loving heart is not sufficient. She also needed to reach forth her hand to take the Bible.</P><P>If we would contact the Lord, receive the Lord, take the Lord, enjoy the Lord, drink the Lord, and eat the Lord, we need a spirit. First, we must love the Lord; we must have an appetite toward the Lord. If we have no love toward the Lord and no appetite for Him, we will never come to Him or take Him. Before we were saved, we had no appetite for the Lord. Instead, our taste was for the world. We had an appetite to go boating or fishing or to participate in sports. When people talked to us about the Lord Jesus, we did not care to listen; we had no interest because we had no appetite. However, one day the Lord granted us His gracious visitation and immediately our appetite changed. Now we have no appetite for amusements and sports. Now we love the Bible, and we love to fellowship with the saints. This is the Lord's gracious doing. This is a real turning of our heart from the world to the Lord Himself. We need such a consuming appetite for the Lord Jesus that it will turn us from so many other appetites. We must be able to tell the Lord that we love Him and that we are hungry for Him alone.</P><P>Once we have acquired a loving appetite toward the Lord, we also need to use our spirit, to contact Him, touch Him, and receive Him into us. This brings us the enjoyment of the Lord. Thus, we need both organs: a loving heart and a receiving spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Our Spirit Having Been Neglected in Christianity</H2><P>The receiving spirit has been greatly neglected in Christianity. In some places messages stirred up people's loving heart, but gave them no help how to exercise their spirit. Praise the Lord! In His recovery we have seen that God has given us not only a new heart, but also a new spirit! We not only have a heart to love Him, but also a spirit to contact and enjoy Him. It is wonderful! Our new heart is very soft toward the Lord. It is not a stiff, hardened, or strong heart, but a heart of flesh, soft toward the Lord. Before we were saved, we could do many sinful things without any feeling of regret. We had no sensation toward sin because our heart was hardened and stiff. But after we were saved, our heart was changed by the Lord. Now we have a softened heart. For example, sometimes we may speak only part of a sentence and sense that we should not have spoken. Then we are forced to cut off the remainder of the sentence, and perhaps even apologize for the first part. We sense even a tiny mistake or a slight impureness in our motive because our heart is soft. This proves we have been converted, revived, and turned to the Lord. Our heart is soft and sensitive.</P><P>Furthermore, we all must realize how to exercise our spirit. A loving heart is not sufficient. We all need both a loving heart plus a receiving spirit. Although we had a human spirit before we were saved, it was dead and functionless. Ephesians 2:5 says that we were dead in our sins and transgressions. This surely means that we were dead in our spirit. We were not dead in our body or in our soul, but in our spirit. When we were saved, the Lord Jesus quickened our spirit and made it alive. Thus, we have a spirit which is alive and renewed. You may feel it is difficult to discern the difference between your spirit and your heart, but do not analyze this with your mind. You can realize the difference according to your experience. Let me again illustrate the difference between having a loving heart toward the Lord and exercising the spirit to contact the Lord. When we consider how sweet the Lord is, how precious the Lord is, and how much He has done for us, we become excited and we can express to the Lord, "Lord Jesus, I love You! O Lord Jesus, I love You!" This is a loving heart.</P><P>On the other hand when we cry and shout and call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we can realize that something deep within besides our heart has been exercised. This is our spirit. When we cry out to the Lord, saying, "O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!" that is the use of our spirit. You discern that you have two feet simply by using them to walk. While you are walking or running you do not need to remember that you have two feet. All the other organs in your body spontaneously pay attention to your feet. Thus, you know that you have two feet simply by using them. It is the same way with the spirit. You can know that you have a spirit by using it. One of the best ways to exercise your spirit is by calling on the name of the Lord, "O Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus! Praise You Lord Jesus!" Immediately, you will forget all your darkness, and you will have the sense of something moving deep within your being. That something is your spirit. Satan, in his subtlety, has cut off and hidden this matter of the spirit from most Christians. They read the Bible, but they do not exercise their spirit. They read the Word merely by the exercise of their mind. We need to pray-read when we read the Bible. This will cause us to exercise our spirit. Just as athletes need to exercise their bodies, we Christians need to exercise our spirit. It is a pitiful thing that we were taught to neglect our spirit. We were taught to take care of our mind, but not our spirit. What a tragedy that most Christians either take care of fundamental teachings or Pentecostal gifts! According to history, teachings and gifts have not been effective in building up the church. This is not to say that teachings and gifts are of absolutely no value, but the main thing we need today is the exercise of our spirit. This is the most crucial thing; this is the most prevailing thing.</P><P>In 1968 a Pentecostal pastor came to visit a church in the Chicago area. After he attended some of the meetings, he told the brothers that although they did not seem to have the manifestations of the gifts, their meetings were more living than his own meetings. Surprised and puzzled, he did not understand how this could be. This indicated that he only appreciated the gifts. This means he only knew the old mule wagon. He did not realize that on the earth today is a 747 jet. Even in 1 Corinthians, there are not only the gifts, there are also many other things. Paul said, "I fed you with milk...I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth" (1 Cor. 3:2, 6). These are not gifts. In addition to this, he said that we all have been baptized into one body in one Spirit and that we all were made to drink of one Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). Neither are these Pentecostal gifts. These other items are also in 1 Corinthians, but those who only care for gifts are blind and cannot see them. Furthermore, the same book says in 15:45 that "the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." The Pentecostal people appreciate 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 concerning speaking in tongues and prophecy, but they neglect 15:45b. Do you prefer tongues above Christ as the life-giving Spirit? By comparison, the life-giving Spirit is like gold and the tongues are like brass. First Corinthians 13:1 says "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal." This indicates a sound without life. If one can speak in the tongues of angels or the tongues of men and yet have no life in spirit, that is sounding brass. In these verses, Paul is showing us that speaking in tongues is not a matter of life. It is a matter merely of sound. I may speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but that is not an expression of life. Why do people appreciate a mule wagon that much? It is simply because they have not seen the 747. It is in the Bible, but they have not seen it. In contrast to present-day Pentecostals, Paul never used the term "Thus saith the Lord." In 1 Corinthians 7:25, Paul said that he had no commandment from the Lord, but based on his age and experience he gave his opinion. He did not say "Thus saith the Lord," yet his opinion is now the inspired Word of God. This term, "Thus saith the Lord," is from the Old Testament. The Roman Catholic Church took Christianity back to Old Testament forms and rituals, and the Pentecostals took Christianity back to Old Testament terms. Neither Peter nor Paul nor John ever wrote, "Thus saith the Lord." None of the ministers in the New Testament used this term "Thus saith the Lord." Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel used this term, but they were the Old Testament prophets. Not one of the New Testament writers used this term. When some Pentecostal people came to our meetings and did not see the manifestation of tongues, they were disappointed. This is pitiful. We all must see the 747 jet airplane and forget about the old mule wagon. We need to see something new, something higher, something better. We must see the Lord's economy. He has given us a new spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Putting His Spirit into Their Spirit</H2><P>Furthermore, the Lord said that He would put His Spirit into their spirit (36:27). Not only would He give them a new heart and a new human spirit, He would put His own Spirit within them. Hallelujah! This is marvelous! We should not neglect our spirit because our spirit is the vessel which contains the divine Spirit. Today, when people hear the word "spirit," they usually think of the Holy Spirit. They seldom consider that they have a human spirit. Certainly, we need the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit is now in our regenerated human spirit. "The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit" (Rom. 8:16). We have a new heart, a new spirit, and we have the Holy Spirit within our spirit strengthening us all the time. This enables us to keep God's commandments because His commandments are according to His nature. We have the nature of God within us because we have His Spirit within us. Something within us corresponds to God's law. Now it is easy for us to keep the law of God because we have His nature. Formerly, it was very difficult for us to love people, but now it is difficult for us to hate people. Formerly, it may have been easy to steal something, but now it is difficult to steal something. We have a new nature within us. God's Spirit within us contains God's nature, and His nature corresponds to His law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Land Becoming Like the Garden of Eden</H2><P>In 36:34-36, the Lord promised that the desolate and waste places would become like the garden of Eden. There the plant of renown, Christ as the tree of life, would be their rich supply. The local churches must reach such a high condition that they are like the garden of Eden. Even today, many times in the meetings, we have the sensation that we are in the garden of Eden.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Bringing in Flocks of Men</H2><P>In the last part of Ezekiel 36 the Lord promised that He would flock people in, but that we need to inquire of Him. In other words we need to pray for the increase. "O Lord, flock people in. You promised this to us." In the past, whenever we prayed for an increase in number, the Lord answered. I feel we need to pray more. The Lord promised, yet He needs our inquiring. He promised that He will increase our number by flocks of men, but we must pray for this and ask Him to do it. In all the local churches, I hope that you will pray definitely and specifically for the increase of numbers. Never be content with the number that you have at the present time. We all should aspire to be doubled within a period of time. We all must pray, "Lord, flock people in!"</P><P>In 1963 in Los Angeles, we had only 20 to 30 people. But after we prayed for six months, the number was very much increased. In Elden Hall we also prayed that the Lord would flock people in. We prayed, "Lord, bring flocks of men to us." The Lord really heard that prayer, and I feel that today we need to pray even more. We need to stand upon and claim this last part of Ezekiel 36 concerning the increase of numbers. Do not say we care nothing for numbers. I beg you never to say this again. If you say this, I will fight against it. I will read to you that in the Acts on one day 3,000 were brought in, and on another day 5,000 were brought in (2:41; 4:4). Several times Acts says that "many believed" or that "the believers were multiplied" (9:42; 11:21; 14:1; 17:12; 18:8). In Acts 21:20 James could tell Paul that tens of thousands have believed (lit.). Do not say that numbers mean nothing. That is an excuse. Do not comfort yourself in your failure. If you have failed regarding the increase, do not be comforted. Rather, you have to be condemned. You must awaken to the fact that you have been in your city for years and still have only a handful of people. That is a shame. We need the increase. Even to be doubled within one year is not too glorious. Pray about this. Claim this. Some would say that we do not care for quantity; we only care for quality. But you must realize that quality cannot come out of nothing. The quality will come out of the quantity. Thus, we must pray for the Lord to give us the increase and to bring in flocks of men.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DRY BONES AND THE TWO STICKS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezekiel 37:1-22</H1><P>We have seen that Ezekiel 34 mainly covers the outward aspects of the Lord's recovery. God came in as the Shepherd to search and seek for His people and to bring them back to the good land. This is the outward aspect of the Lord's recovery. Then Ezekiel 36 covers the inward aspect of the Lord's recovery. The Lord not only brings us back outwardly, but also regenerates us inwardly. He gives us a new heart and a new spirit, and He puts His Spirit within us. It is not merely a matter of outward position and outward circumstances, but it is also a matter of the inward nature and inward disposition. The Lord's recovery is not something merely outward. Even more, it is something inward. Not only were our position, our circumstances, and our surroundings changed, but we also had the inward renewing of a new heart, a new spirit, and we received the divine Spirit of God. Outwardly there is a change, and inwardly there is a conversion. Ezekiel 36, however, does not tell us clearly and thoroughly how we may have a conversion, a new heart, and a new spirit, and how we may obtain God's Spirit. It is simply mentioned in a general way that He will give us a new heart, a new spirit, and His own Spirit. Thus, we need Ezekiel 37 to tell us how God can renew us and regenerate us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DEAD AND DRY BONES</H2><P>First, we need to realize that before God came in to renew us and regenerate us, we were like dead and dry bones. If we had only Ezekiel 36, we would realize that we were evil, bad, sinful, dirty, and filthy, but we would never think that we were dead. Ezekiel 37 says that not only were we dead, but we were also dry bones. God's salvation is not merely for sinful people. God's salvation is for dead people. We were not only sinful, but we were also dead and buried. When we fell, whether as a sinner or a backslidden believer, in God's eyes we were buried in a grave. We were in many graves. A gambling casino is a kind of grave; a movie is a kind of grave; hatred is a kind of grave. Before we were saved or before we were revived, we were buried in all those graves. We were not only sinful, but dead and buried. We were fully dried up. We had no blood, no flesh, no sinew, no skin&#151;just dry bones. This is a picture showing where we were and what we were to the uttermost. Have you ever realized that you were not only sinful, but also dead and buried dry bones?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING SCATTERED</H2><P>Because you were dead and dry, you were also scattered. Not one piece of bone was drawn to another piece. All the bones were disjointed and scattered, having no oneness. Whether you were an unsaved sinner or whether you were a backslidden believer, this was exactly your situation. You were dead and buried in the grave. Christians today are buried in the graves of denominations, in the graves of divisions, in the graves of free groups, and in the graves of so many movements. All these groups are graves. How do we know that these are graves? We can know because they are dead and dry, scattered and disjointed. They are not connected to anyone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECOVERY THROUGH PROPHESYING</H2><P>Praise the Lord, He did not leave us in that kind of situation, but He came in to rescue us! The Lord did not, however, come in directly to be the Shepherd, but He came in through Ezekiel and through the prophesying of His Word. Many Christians have the wrong understanding about the meaning of prophesying. They think that to prophesy only means to predict. But have you noticed that in Ezekiel 37 there is hardly any prediction? Rather, it is a matter of declaring something or speaking something forth. Prophesying in Ezekiel 37 does not mainly mean to predict; rather, it means to tell forth. It means a kind of declaration. When the Lord said to Ezekiel, "Son of man prophesy," it meant "Speak forth." The Lord told Ezekiel that when he prophesied, He would send the breath and the wind. When Ezekiel spoke forth, God gave people the Spirit. Thus, we can see clearly that the main meaning of prophesying is not that of predicting, but of speaking forth something for the Lord.</P><P>Other Christians may think that to prophesy is to teach others. But, no matter how much you teach dry bones, they remain dry bones. When Ezekiel prophesied, speaking something for God, God followed him. As he was prophesying, God was blowing, sending the wind, the breath, and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WIND, THE BREATH, AND THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Three things were related to the prophesying: the wind, the breath, and the Spirit. Although in English these are three different words, in Hebrew they are only one word, ruach. Verse 9 uses the word "wind" several times and it also uses the word "breath." But according to the Hebrew text, both the wind and the breath are the same word, ruach. In verse 14, there is the word "Spirit." This word is also ruach. It is difficult for the translators to decide whether to translate ruach into the wind or into the breath or into the Spirit. It depends upon the context and it depends upon the understanding of the translator. Let me illustrate the difference to you in this way: when God blows upon you, that is the wind; when you breathe the wind, it is the breath; when it gets into you, it is the Spirit. First comes the wind, then the wind becomes the breath, and eventually you have the Spirit. When Ezekiel prophesied, God blew the wind and then the breath. The people received the breath, and the breath became the Spirit. This is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A NOISE AND A SHAKING</H2><P>Ezekiel prophesied twice in this chapter. The first time is in verse 7, and the second time is in verse 10. In verse 7 when he prophesied, there was a noise and a shaking. I like these two words, "a noise" and "a shaking." Some people say to us, "Your meetings are too noisy." My answer to them is that if you go among the dry bones, they are really quiet. There is no noise and no voice&#151;just quietness. In that valley all the bones were in a good order. Because they were all buried in the graves, they were quiet and they had no problems. But when Ezekiel came and prophesied, there was a noise and a shaking and the bones all came together. I cannot explain to you why there was a noise and a shaking and then all the dry bones came together. But we do know that according to our experience, when we come to the meetings and make a lot of noise, we are really one.</P><P>Suppose we all come into the meeting and sit quietly for thirty minutes. Soon we will be critical of one another, and eventually we will lose our oneness. But when we come in and we make some noise, shouting joyfully to the Lord Jesus, calling on His name, praising His name, we are one! It may not sound nice to you or look nice to you, but the more noise you make, the more you will be one. If you will call on the Lord Jesus strongly for a time, you will be crazily one. You will forget everything. You will forget the brothers, the sisters, the heavens, and the earth. You will be crazily one. We do not need religion, we need the noise and the shaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BREATH COMING IN</H2><P>After the noise and the shaking and the coming together, sinews, flesh, and skin came upon the bones. This covered them, causing their appearance to be much better. Formerly, they were only dry bones. But now there is a dead body gathered up, joined together, connected, and coordinated. I say it is a dead body, because it still has no breath. According to our experience, this is right. All the dead bones must first come together, and then the breath will come into them. If we will not gather together, we will not receive the breath of God. It is not that we wait until we have the breath of God, and then we come together to be one. No! We must first come together with a noise and a shaking and then the breath of God will be breathed upon us. When Ezekiel prophesied again, God sent the breath to get into those dead bodies. Then they all stood up, not on others' feet, but upon their own two feet. In Christianity, many people stand on their pastor's feet or on others' feet. But there all the revived ones stood up on their own two feet.</P><P>When they stood up they became an "exceeding great army" to fight the battle for God. First there came a noise and a shaking and then the dry bones came together; the breath of God came into them and they stood up on their feet&#151;a great army (37:7, 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO DRY STICKS BEING JOINED</H2><P>In the second part of the chapter, the Lord told Ezekiel to pick up two sticks representing the northern and the southern kingdoms of Israel (37:16-17). Ezekiel dealt first with the dry bones, and then he dealt with the dry sticks. A stick is something wooden, yet it is dead. It is cut off and dried up. These two sticks symbolized the two kingdoms of Israel, the southern kingdom and the northern kingdom. Those two kingdoms could never be one. In the eyes of the Lord they were thoroughly dead and dried up. How could two dry sticks be one? The Lord has a way. It is the way of life. The Lord made the two sticks alive, and putting them together, made them grow together. When two branches are grafted together, they grow as one tree. This is exactly what is mentioned here. The two sticks were like two branches. Formerly they had no life, but then they were made alive. In the first part of Ezekiel 37, life came in through the breath of God. By putting these two parts of the chapter together, we can see that the two sticks now had life. Because they had life, they were able to grow with one another and to become one. The bones are for forming the army, but the sticks are for the building of the house of God. They had been divided, but now they were one and had become the dwelling place of God. They were the army fighting the battle for God, and they were also the house of God as His dwelling place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY OF LIFE</H2><P>Christians today talk much about the Body and about the church life and about the house of God. But they do not see the practical way to have the Body and the church and the house of God. In this chapter we can see clearly that there is no other way except the way of life. The way of life is the unique way. How can two dry sticks grow together? Can they grow by teachings or by gifts? They can grow only by the way of life. The Lord did not tell Ezekiel to exercise his gifts or to teach, but to prophesy, to utter some words, to speak forth some words for God. As Ezekiel declared something to the dead ones, God blew upon them and they breathed in the breath. When the breath came into them, they became alive. It is by life that the two dry sticks could grow together. We can never be one by gifts and teachings; we can be one only by life.</P><P>Oh, we all need the blowing of the wind and the breathing of the Spirit! We need the breath as the life-giving Spirit. Then we all can grow in life. Life is a wonderful thing. It takes care of so many problems. Our physical body can overcome many problems simply because it is living. Life takes care of problems. In the church life we do not need gifts or teachings; we need life. By the inner life and by the growth of life, the two dead branches will receive life and grow into one another. They will have oneness issuing out of the growth in life. If we pay attention to gifts or teachings, we will surely be divided. We all need to see something better, something higher, which is life, the inner life, and the growth in life. First comes the blowing of the wind, followed by the breathing. Then comes the life-giving Spirit. All the dry bones become alive and become one. Finally they become an army fighting the battle for the Lord. Likewise, all the dry sticks become alive and grow up into one another. By the growth of life they are one and have no more divisions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONENESS BY LIFE</H2><P>How we praise the Lord that in His recovery we have oneness! Although we came from many different kinds of backgrounds, today we are one. We are one not by gifts or by teachings, but by life. In the Lord's recovery, we have many ex-pastors, ex-missionaries, ex-ministers, and ex-Bible teachers, but all of these are now one in life. We do not care for opinions, we only care for life. We are not one in gifts; we are one in life. Because we are alive, we are one. Now we are an army fighting the battle.</P><P>When the saints migrate, they are an army fighting the battle. We can never have proper migrations if we do not have oneness. It is so good that in the migrations, some come from different parts of the country to be one in a city. They come together to be one, not in teachings or in gifts, but in life. Thank the Lord! We are the dwelling place of the Lord, and we are the army. Today the Lord has a home, not in a physical building, but in a group of living persons. All the local churches today on the earth are one home to the Lord. Because we all were made alive, we can grow together. Though some may be from New Zealand and others from Germany, we still are one home. We are one home not by gifts, not by teachings, but by life. Hallelujah! We are the army; we are the dwelling place, the sanctuary! The army was formed with the dry bones, and the sanctuary was built with the dry sticks. Now none is dry. Every part is alive, full of life, having the oneness. This is the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FURTHER JUDGMENT</H2><P>Following chapter thirty-seven are two further chapters on judgment. If we will go on with the Lord in oneness as an army and a dwelling place of the Lord on the earth, the Lord will take care of all our enemies. Hallelujah! The Lord will take care of the enemies! Do not think that since we are an army, we will have no enemies, and do not think that since we are one as the Lord's dwelling place, we will have no battles. There is still the enemy, but the Lord will take care of him. In Ezekiel 35 there is Edom, the enemy within, and in 38 and 39 there is the enemy without. We have to judge the enemy within us, but the Lord will take care of the enemy without. Praise the Lord! As long as we are one, the Lord will fight the battle for us. He will deal with our enemy, who is His enemy, also. Hallelujah, we can be in the church life in peace and safety. When we deal with the inward enemy, our old man, the Lord will take care of the outward enemy and a strong church life will be built up to be "an exceeding great army" and the Lord's sanctuary on this earth.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE VISION OF THE HOLY BUILDING<br>OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezekiel 40:1-27</H1><P>Now we come to the holy building of God. We have seen in previous chapters the appearance of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God by fire, and the recovery of the Lord by life. Now we come to the last section, the holy building of God. This section covers chapters forty through forty-eight. We have to be clear that all three foregoing sections are for the last section. The glory of the Lord, the judgment of the Lord, and the recovery of the Lord are for the building of God. We may even say that the issue of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God, and the recovery of the Lord is the building of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TIME OF THE VISION</H2><P>At the beginning of this section, it mentions the year, the month, and the day (40:1). By comparing the year mentioned here with the year mentioned at the beginning of chapter one, we can see that there is a difference of twenty years. The vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord which Ezekiel saw in chapter one was seen in the fifth year of the captivity. The vision of the building of God's house which he saw in chapter forty was in the twenty-fifth year of their captivity. Twenty years is not a short time. Remember that Ezekiel was thirty years of age when he saw the first vision. Thirty years is the age at which a priest can begin to function. When he saw the last vision, he was fifty years old, the age of retirement for a priest. According to Numbers 4:3, the priest served from the age of thirty to the age of fifty. This is quite meaningful. This indicates that to see the building of God, Ezekiel needed more maturity in life. When he saw the first vision, he was still young, only thirty years of age. But when he saw the vision of God's building, he was at the age of retirement, indicating that he had further maturity in life and could see the building of the Lord. Very few Christians have seen anything of the Lord's building due to their immaturity. Some of them are still under thirty years of age, and perhaps others are under twenty-five years. They are not even qualified to be an apprentice. How could they see the vision of God's building? To see the building of God needs further maturity in the spiritual life.</P><P>It is very meaningful that all the years were counted in increments of five. The first vision was seen in the fifth year, and the last vision was seen in the twenty-fifth year. Twenty-five is five times five. We have to remember that five in the Bible signifies man plus God. Man the creature plus God the Creator can bear responsibility. Four is the number representing the creature, and one is the number representing the Creator. Five is four plus one, meaning that man as the creature plus God as the Creator can together bear responsibility. The number twenty-five means not only the maturity, but also the full qualification for bearing responsibility.</P><P>This year was also called the fourteenth year. The twenty-fifth year was counted from the time of their captivity, whereas, the fourteenth year was counted from the time of the destruction of Jerusalem. In 40:1 it says, "after that the city was smitten." The number fourteen in the Bible is composed mainly of seven times two. Seven is the number of completion, and two is the number of testimony. This tells us that for fourteen years, the destruction of the city of Jerusalem had been a strong testimony to the people. Originally, the people of Israel did not believe that the city would be destroyed. But Ezekiel prophesied concerning the destruction of the city of Jerusalem and his prophecy was fulfilled. Fourteen years after the destruction of Jerusalem, Ezekiel saw further visions. This means that the testimony of the destruction of the city was sufficient; it stood for fourteen years. After the fourteen years, the people in captivity realized that it was a strong testimony.</P><P>Furthermore, the Bible says that Ezekiel saw the visions at the beginning of the year in the first month. The first month indicates a new start. The building of God must have a new start with us. When we see something of the building of the church, it is a new start in our life. It is also the tenth day. According to Exodus 12:3, the tenth of the first month was the day that the people of Israel prepared the lamb for the Passover. Surely this refers to Christ, our Passover, for our redemption. Whenever we have a new beginning in our Christian life, it is based on Christ and His redemption. We ourselves, by what we are and what we can do, can never have a new beginning. We are not qualified to have a new beginning. We have no merit to have a new beginning. Any new beginning we can have in our spiritual life is always based upon Christ, the Passover Lamb, and His redemption. By Christ and His redemption, we can have a new beginning in our Christian life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PLACE TO SEE THE VISION</H2><P>Ezekiel did not see the vision concerning the building of God in the land of captivity. Rather, he was brought back to the holy land, to a high mountain, and to Jerusalem itself. Many brothers and sisters can testify that while they were in captivity in the denominations, they could not see the vision of the building of the church. But when they came back to the holy land, to the church life, they could see the vision of the building of the church. In order to see something properly, we need the right position, we need the right standing, and we need the right angle. If we are standing in the wrong position and the wrong standing, we can never see it. If you want to see the city of Los Angeles, you must come to Los Angeles. Even if you were on the highest mountains in New Zealand, still you could not see Los Angeles. You must have the proper position. We must come to Jerusalem so that we can see Jerusalem. We need to come to the site of the temple so that we can see the building. We need not only the position, but also the right angle. This means we must be on the mountain. Ezekiel was not the only person who saw God's building. In Revelation, John told us that he was carried away in spirit to a high mountain to see the holy city, New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:10). This is because the building of God is something in the resurrection and ascension of Christ. We must be in an elevated position in order to see the building of the church.</P><P>Some people have been offended because of my ministering on the building of God. This is because they are like little boys and girls who are playing with toys. If you touch their toys, surely you will offend them. If you tell children that they need to grow up and to drop all their toys, they will surely be upset. But may the Lord be merciful to us so that we may grow up and that we may go up. We not only need to grow up, but we also need to go up to the highest position with the highest angle to see the building of God. If Ezekiel had remained in Babylon in the captivity, he would never have seen the building. Likewise, if he had been on a plain and not on the mountaintop, he would never have seen the building. Therefore, we need to grow up, we need to go up, and we need to get to the mountaintop. There we can see the building of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE VISION OF A MAN</H2><P>Before Ezekiel saw the vision of the building, he saw a man. This man did not look like electrum as the man did in chapter one, but rather he looked like brass (40:3). In chapter one, in the vision of the glory of the Lord, the Lord Jesus on the throne looked like electrum. But in chapter forty, He was not on the throne. He was at the gate of the building, measuring. In the Bible, measuring means to judge and take possession. When a sister goes to the store to buy some cloth, first she measures it. While she is measuring, she is judging whether or not that particular piece of cloth is the right one. In her measuring, she judges. In chapter forty, the Lord Jesus was not on the throne in the appearance of the electrum; He was at the gate in the appearance of brass to measure and take possession. When the Lord Jesus comes to measure something, first He judges it. In typology brass or copper signifies judgment. When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was likened to a serpent of brass (John 3:14). In Exodus 38:1-7, the altar of burnt offering was overlaid with brass. This shows that brass indicates judgment. Something is judged so that it can stand. Once it is judged, it can stand any kind of test or examination. It can stand any kind of further judgment. The Lord Jesus is such a person. He passed God's judgment, and now He has become a test to others. Because He was able to stand all kinds of tests, examinations and judgments, He is fully qualified to measure everything, including the building of God. By His judgment He measures what belongs to God's building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HOLY BUILDING OF GOD</H2><P>First, we will consider a general sketch, or plot plan, of the building of God. You will find it very helpful to refer to the chart in order to understand the plot plan of the building. The whole building is square with four sides, each side being 500 cubits long. Although it has four sides, only three sides have an entrance. There is a gate on the east, on the south, and on the north. When you enter the gate you are immediately in the outer court. In the outer court, around the walls, are six pavements made of stone.</P><P>On each pavement are five chambers built as places for the people to eat and enjoy the sacrifices and offerings. This means the chambers are the places to enjoy Christ. Thus, there are five chambers on each of six pavements, making a total of 30 chambers for the people to eat and enjoy the offerings. Within the outer court there is an inner court which also has three gates. This makes a total of six gates&#151;three to the outer court and three to the inner court. The building has two walls, the wall of the outside court and the wall of the inner court. With every wall there are three gates. The measurement and design of all the walls and gates are exactly the same.</P><P>Within the inner court is the altar which is at the center of the whole compound of the building of God. The altar is a type of the cross. The cross of Christ is at the very center of God's economy, God's interest.</P><P>In this section on God's building, from Ezekiel 40 through 48, three main things are covered: the holy temple, the holy city, and the holy land. All three of these items are holy. Ezekiel begins not from the outside, but from the inside. He begins with the temple, then the city, then the land. God's economy always begins from within, not from without. According to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, we have a spirit and soul and body. There it also begins from within. It does not start from the outside and say, "body and soul and spirit"; rather, it says, "spirit and soul and body." God's economy is always from within, but men's movements are always from without. We must learn the lesson that in the church life we should not have anything from without. In the church life we must always have something from within&#151;first the temple, then the city, and then the land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Wall</H2><P>The first item we need to see concerning the temple is the wall. The temple has a wall on all four sides. The wall is for separation, separating what belongs to God and what can never belong to God. The wall is a separating line. According to the measurement of the wall, we can realize that the wall is Christ Himself as a separating line. Whatever is within Christ belongs to God's interest and to God's building. Whatever is outside of Christ is excluded from God's interest and God's building. Christ Himself is the separating line. In a city of millions of people, how can we know who are of God and who are not of God? How can we separate them? It must be by Christ as the separating line. Whoever is in Christ belongs to God. Whoever is outside of Christ is separate from God. Whoever belongs to Christ is within the wall, and whoever is outside of Christ is outside of the wall. Thus, the wall is Christ as the separating line.</P><P>The measurement of the wall is very unusual. I do not think that through all the centuries of human history there has ever been another such wall. It is six cubits high and also six cubits thick. It is six by six. If you look at a cross section of this wall, you will see a square. What is the meaning of the number six? Man was created on the sixth day. This wall is Jesus as a square, upright, perfect, and complete man. Jesus, as a square, upright, perfect, complete, and even resurrected man is the separating line. He is fully qualified because He is square and upright. In Him there is no imperfection and no shortage. In Him there is nothing crooked; with Him everything is straight. Such a man is the separating line. If only Jesus is such a man, we are all excluded. We are not square. It may be that we have twenty-eight corners. Furthermore, we are crooked, not upright, and incomplete. If Jesus alone is this wall, we are excluded. After reading the four Gospels, some people in poor Christianity try to imitate Christ. The more they try to imitate Christ, the more they collapse. Who can imitate Christ? It is impossible! There is no possibility for any fallen human beings to follow or imitate Christ. Christ is too square! too upright! too perfect! too complete! We simply cannot imitate Him. When we come to Him, we are judged and condemned. When we read the four Gospels concerning His life, we are condemned. For example, in Luke 2, when Jesus was a child of twelve years, He obeyed His parents in the flesh regardless of how much He was for His Father in the heavens. Young people, when you read those verses, do you not feel that you are condemned? You are not obedient to your parents while you are seeking after the Father's interest, but Jesus was. The life history of Jesus is a condemning factor to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Gate</H2><P>Hallelujah! He is not only the wall; He is also the gate. As the wall He excludes and condemns us, but as the gate He brings us into God's building. If you are in the sphere of God's building today, it is because Christ as the gate has brought you in. Praise the Lord! Christ is our gate, our door (John 10:9). In John 14:6, the Lord Jesus said that He was the way. Apart from Him, no man can come to the Father. He is not only the wall, but also the gateway for us to get into God and into God's kingdom. He is the gate for us to enter into God's interest and into God's building. Many Christians realize that Christ is the door, but few know Christ as the door in a detailed way. Only Ezekiel saw the details of Christ as the gate. If we had the time, I would like to spend ten days to get into all the details of the gates.</P><P>The depth of the gate, from the front to the rear, is fifty cubits. The breadth of the gate from side to side is twenty-five cubits. These numbers are composed of five times five. Fifty cubits is ten times five; twenty-five cubits is five times five. Again, we have five, the number of responsibility.</P><P>In front of the gate is a stair of seven steps. The steps of ascent are quite high, meaning that when you go into the building, you must go up. Whenever a person believes in Jesus, he has the feeling that he is going up. If someone were to go to Las Vegas to gamble, he would have the sensation that he is going down, or if someone were going to a movie or to participate in some kind of sport, he would have the sensation that he is going down. Even when the sisters go shopping, they sense that they are going down. But, when we come to the Lord Jesus, our sensation is that we are on a staircase going up.</P><P>The gate is composed of four sections: the outer threshold, the passage, the inner threshold, and the porch. It has a total of three thresholds. There is the outer threshold, the inner threshold, and between these two there is a passage called a hallway. The middle part, the passage, is also called a threshold. But, in order to help people to realize the difference, we use another word, the passage. Thus, it has the outer threshold, the passage, then the inner threshold, and last, it has the porch. The porch is somewhat like a lobby to the temple. After you pass through the outer threshold, the passage, the inner threshold, and the lobby, you enter into the outer court of the temple. At that time you must take another flight of stairs of eight steps. This time the ascent is even higher, being eight steps rather than seven.</P><P>By referring to the drawing of the gate, you can see that within the gate is the entry of the gate, which is exactly ten cubits wide. It is meaningful that the opening of the entrance is ten cubits wide. The number ten in the Bible first of all refers to the Ten Commandments. Whatever the Ten Commandments require, the entry of the gate fulfills. The width or the breadth of the entry is exactly the span of the Ten Commandments. The Lord Jesus fulfilled all the requirements of the Ten Commandments. When we are faced with the Ten Commandments, we are excluded, but the Lord Jesus was able to fulfill every commandment and become the gate for us to enter into God's building.</P><P>While the entry or the opening is ten cubits wide, the gate is thirteen cubits wide. The gate is three cubits wider than the opening. On both sides of the gate, the wall measures one and a half cubits. By adding the two together, we have three cubits. Three is the number of the Triune God and also the number of resurrection. Here the three is divided&#151;one and one-half is on one side, and one and one-half is on the other. Please remember that in the tabernacle in the wilderness, the standing boards were one and one-half cubits wide and that two of them formed one unit of three cubits. All these numbers mean that the Lord Jesus, who fills all the requirements of the Ten Commandments, is the Triune God who became a man, was split (put to death), and was resurrected. By His death He was figuratively cut into two halves, and then He was resurrected.</P><P>After the gate comes the threshold, which measures six cubits by ten cubits. By putting these numbers together we can realize that Christ is the Triune God who became a man having the number six. He was split in His death and was resurrected, fulfilling all the requirements of the Ten Commandments. By this process He opened the gate. You may say this is simply an interpretation. It may be, but what kind of interpretation do you have? If I see the letters b-o-y, my interpretation is "boy." What is your interpretation? It must be the same. Three is the number of the Triune God and of resurrection, six is the number of man, and ten signifies the Ten Commandments in two groups of five.</P><P>From the threshold we go to the passage. The passage has many details. Ezekiel 40:10 says that in this passage are six little chambers or guardrooms. Some of the better translations say "guardrooms." These are the rooms where the guards stay who protect the temple. The guardrooms are six cubits long and six cubits wide. Again, we have a square of six cubits. The size of the guardroom is exactly the size of the cross section of the wall. This means that the Lord Jesus in His Person and work is the real guard of God's glory and God's holiness. If there were no wall, all the sinful people would be able to enter into the temple and become an insult to God's glory and God's holiness. The wall separates the sinners from God, but the gates bring people in. In order for the Lord Jesus to be the gate to bring people in, He had to fulfill all the requirements of the Ten Commandments. He was a square, upright, proper man, able to fulfill the Ten Commandments, and now He Himself becomes the guardrooms of God's glory and God's holiness. Only those who are fully qualified and match God's glory and God's holiness can enter the temple. Who can be fully qualified? Only those who have passed through the gate. By passing through the gate, our Lord Jesus, we are qualified to enter into God's building which is full of God's glory and God's holiness.</P><P>The six guardrooms are divided into two groups of three. Again, we have the number three signifying the Triune God who became a man and was split into two. He is the guardrooms. The guardrooms are a person, Christ Himself. The Lord Jesus was the Triune God incarnated to be a man, crucified, and resurrected. Between the three guardrooms are two spaces of five cubits each. Again we have ten cubits composed of two groups of five cubits. This shows us once more that Christ bears the responsibility to fulfill all the requirements of the Ten Commandments. Furthermore, it is on two sides, signifying a testimony. Two indicate a testimony. On one side there are two spaces of five cubits each, and on the other side there are also two spaces of five cubits. This indicates to us that Christ bears the responsibility of the Ten Commandments fully, and that this becomes a testimony. The Lord Jesus as the Triune God became a man and died on the cross, fulfilling all the responsibilities of the Ten Commandments.</P><P>From the guardrooms we go to the borders which the King James Version translates as the "space" and which some other versions translate as the "platform." Outside each of the guardrooms is a border, a space, which is one cubit wide. These are in two groups of three signifying the Triune God in resurrection. Six means man, and two means a testimony. Remember that the passage is ten cubits wide, meaning that the Ten Commandments are wholly fulfilled by the Lord Jesus. If, however, we deduct one cubit for the border around the guardroom on each side, this leaves the passage only eight cubits wide. Eight is the number of resurrection. The first day of the week is also the eighth day, the day of resurrection, and signifies a new beginning. When we pass through Christ, we pass through resurrection and have a new beginning. Thus, you may say that the passage is ten cubits wide, or you may also say that the passage is eight cubits wide.</P><P>After the borders come the posts. It is difficult to find the posts. Ezekiel 40:14 says that the posts are a total of sixty cubits and that every post has two sides. The post here means the columns. Each column has two sides, and each side is of two cubits. On the sides of the passage are fifteen sides of two cubits each. Thus, there are thirty cubits on both sides of the passage, altogether equaling sixty cubits. Fifteen is composed of three times five, signifying the Triune God in resurrection bearing all the responsibility. The number two is also present, indicating a testimony. The number thirty corresponds with the chambers of all the pavements for enjoying Christ. The columns, which support the roof of the structure, indicate that we must be upheld by the supporting strength of Christ in order to enter into the enjoyment of Christ. The supporting strength is of the number thirty, and the enjoyment of Christ is also of the number thirty. This means that we can enjoy only as much as Christ can support. We cannot enjoy more than Christ supports. The expression of Christ, as seen in the side chambers of the temple, is also thirty. Thus, the expression of Christ, the enjoyment of Christ, and the supporting of Christ are signified by thirty. We can only express what we enjoy, and we can only enjoy what Christ can support.</P><P>From the posts we go to the porch where the number eight is used. In the foregoing portion, mainly the numbers five, six, and ten are used, but with the porch the number eight is used. This means that we are now in resurrection, in a new beginning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WINDOWS</H2><P>The windows are for letting in the light and the air. If a building has no windows, it has no air and no light. Covering the windows is a lattice, a screen, which keeps out all the negative things. These are not narrow windows, but latticed windows. They have strips of material over them to protect the whole building from the negative things. Yet the windows are kept open for air and light. The latticed windows signify the life-giving Spirit. There are altogether thirty windows, fifteen windows on one side and fifteen on the other side. The gate is full of windows. This indicates that Christ is full of the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit brings in the air and light and keeps out all the negative things. Furthermore, the Hebrew word for lattice implies the thought of being beveled, meaning that the outer side of the window is narrow, but the inner side is wider (40:16). The life-giving Spirit is always toward the inside. Outwardly speaking, He is not wide, but inwardly speaking, He is very wide.</P><P>While Ezekiel mentions the height of the wall, he does not give the height of the gate. Man's concept is that he should climb higher until he reaches the heavens. That was the concept in building the tower of Babel. But God's intention and desire is with man on earth. God wants to come to the earth and to spread His testimony upon the earth. The entire compound of the temple does not give the impression of height, but of spreading in a spacious way. Even the height of the wall is only six cubits. God came to the earth to be a man and to spread His testimony over the whole earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>These are the details relating to the gate. We all have passed through the gate, but we never realized the details of the gate. Even as we take in many vitamins unknowingly in the good things that we eat, so we have passed through such a rich gate and did not know the details.</P><P>The gates signify Christ as the Triune God. As the Triune God He became a man who was square, upright, and complete. It also signifies that Christ bore the responsibility and fulfilled all the requirements of the Ten Commandments to open the gates for us to get into God and into God's interest. Furthermore, Christ, as the number two, is the testimony of God. He is the resurrected one who is a living witness of victory forever. Finally, on the two sides of each column is a palm tree. Palm trees in the Bible signify victory and something evergreen. This means everlasting victory. Christ is the guard of God's holiness and glory. Christ is the victorious one standing, bearing, sustaining, prevailing, and everlasting. Christ is the life-giving Spirit, quickening and enlivening.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE OUTER AND THE INNER COURTS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 40:17-47; 46:21-24</H1><P>In the last chapter we saw that all the details related to the gates are very meaningful. We saw that the gates were divided into four sections: the first threshold, a passage, a further threshold, and the porch. Each gate was six cubits high by ten cubits wide. Six is the number of the Lord's perfect humanity by which He fulfilled the requirements of the Ten Commandments. This means that the number six fulfills the number ten. The man Jesus fulfills the Ten Commandments. We also saw that the dimensions of the guardrooms match the dimensions of the cross section of the wall, six cubits by six cubits. This indicates to us that the six guardrooms are Christ Himself. The six guardrooms are God mingled with man. The passage, having the number eight, indicates a new beginning in resurrection. The final section of each gate, the porch, has the numbers two, six, and eight. These numbers indicate that the Lord as a man is fully in resurrection and is qualified to be a proper witness.</P><P>The gate was supported by fifteen posts, each having two sides. The total number of sides was thirty, and these thirty sides made a total of sixty cubits. All the numbers in the book of Ezekiel are very meaningful. The numbers three, five, and multiples of five are used extensively. For example, three times five is fifteen. Also, six times five is thirty. This signifies the Triune God in resurrection bearing the full responsibility. When Ezekiel first saw the visions in chapter one, he was thirty years of age. There were thirty posts supporting the structure, there were thirty chambers in the outer court, and there were thirty side chambers surrounding the temple. The number thirty in Ezekiel indicates maturity which is able to bear something and also indicates the enjoyment and expression of Christ.</P><P>Furthermore, we saw that the palm trees on the posts indicated victory and everlasting power. Because the columns must bear the weight of the roof and support the whole building, they must be in victory and they must be everlasting. Christ is the column which supports and bears God's building with a victorious and everlasting life. He has won the victory, and He is everlasting! He is evergreen!</P><P>We also saw that the gate had thirty windows to let in light and air, and that the windows were covered with lattice as a kind of screen to keep out all the negative things. Thus, light and air were able to enter, but all the negative things were kept out. This is precisely the work of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. He brings in the air and the light, and He continually screens and blocks out all the negative things.</P><P>The plot plan of the gate indicates what a wonderful Christ we can experience and pass through. One measurement not given is the height of the gate. The height of the wall is given, but the height of the gate is not. The omission of this dimension is very significant. According to Ezekiel, God's intention is with man on earth. God's concept in His building is absolutely different from the natural concept present among the fallen human race when they built the tower of Babel. Genesis 11 shows that man's concept was to build a tower higher and higher until it reached the heavens. This means that man's concept and desire is to go into the heavens. In Ezekiel, however, God's concept is to come down to this earth. God's concept is not to reach higher and higher, but to spread wider and wider. According to the plot plan, the temple compound is 500 cubits square. The height is not great, but the spread is very great. In the record of Ezekiel, the height means very little, but the spread means very much. The wall is only six cubits high, but it is also six cubits broad. This indicates that in God's concept He wants to become a man and come to earth to spread His testimony. The concept at Babel was to go higher and higher into the heavens, but the concept of God's building is that God would come down to earth to man and spread His testimony in a spacious way upon the earth. This is why the record gives us not the height, but the breadth of the gate. The gate is not high, but it is very spacious. It is not in four floors or stories, but it covers four flat sections on the earth. If you looked at the gate, you would not have an impression of height, but of spaciousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OUTER COURT</H2><P>If we would enter the temple Ezekiel saw in his vision, we must first climb up the seven steps and then pass through the spacious gate. This would bring us to the outer court of the temple. Please remember there were two courts: the outer court and the inner court. First we need to see what was in the outer court. (See plot plan on p. 150.)</P><P>The main thing in the outer court was the pavement which ran around all the walls on the east, the south, and the north sides. There were six different areas of pavement. On each area of the pavement there were five chambers, making a total of thirty chambers. Again we have the number thirty composed of ten times three.</P><P>In addition to the thirty chambers on the pavement, there were also four small courts, one at each corner of the outer court (46:21-24). These four small corner chambers were the places to boil the sacrifices. In modern terms, these were the kitchens, the places for cooking the food. They were not the cooking places for the priests, but for the people. The priests did not eat in the outer court, but in the inner court. The people, however, ate in the outer court. Just outside the four corner chambers were the other chambers (40:17). What was the purpose of these chambers? In our homes, the room connected to the kitchen is the dining room. In Ezekiel it is exactly the same. The chambers connected to the kitchens were the dining places, the places for the people to enjoy the sacrifices. This means the chambers were the places for them to enjoy Christ. We must see that the main thing in the outer court was to enjoy Christ by eating the sacrifices and the offerings. Once people entered through the gate, they did not simply walk around the outer court; rather, they went into the dining rooms to eat the offerings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PAVEMENT</H2><P>Furthermore, Ezekiel says that the chambers for eating were built upon the pavement (40:17). In ancient times the pavement of the porch was made with stones. This is very meaningful. When we are going to enjoy Christ, we must be upon the stones. The stone pavement separates us from the dirt of the earth. If we walked into the outer court and there were no stone pavement, our feet would be on the dirt of the earth. But the pavement, being made of stone, keeps us separate from the dirt of the earth. We are still on this earth and in this world, but our feet are kept separate by Christ from any kind of dirt. Originally we were clay, having the same nature as the earth. We came out of the earth, and we were one with the earth, but when we were regenerated, the clay became stone. The stones are for the pavement. If we would enjoy Christ, we must stand upon the base, the stones of our regeneration.</P><P>Let me illustrate the stone pavement by comparing two kinds of Christians. One kind of Christian works at his office during the day, comes home, watches television, or listens to his radio before dinner. After dinner he and his wife go to a club, a party, or to some other kind of amusement. They are real Christians, but they are standing, not on the pavement of stones, but on the dirt. They are not separated from the earth by the pavement of stones. Another kind of Christian also works during the day, but when he comes home he begins to call on the Lord Jesus, to exercise his spirit, and to prepare himself for the meeting. As he eats dinner, he is praying and fellowshipping, anticipating the enjoyment of Christ in the meeting. Then, he prepares to go to the meeting, to the chambers. In one corner he sees brothers and sisters boiling and cooking Christ, and in another corner, other brothers and sisters also boiling, cooking, and preparing Christ. Then, when he gets into the meeting, he starts to praise the Lord and to eat and enjoy Christ. Surely this dear one is standing on the stone pavement.</P><P>Whenever we stand on the stone pavement in such a way, it becomes the very place for us to enjoy Christ. We all must be in the chambers enjoying Christ. To unbelievers and also to many Christians, the Lord's Day is a day of sinning. They use it for sports, fishing, dancing, or for going to different kinds of entertainment. To them it is really "Sunday." Sunday is an idolatrous term because it honors the sun. Supposedly, Sunday is for worshipping God, but in fact it is a day of sinning. We all need to learn to call the first day of the week the Lord's Day and not Sunday. Surely all those people who enjoy the worldly pleasures and amusements on their Sunday are standing on the dirt. We should be those who have their feet on the solid pavement on the Lord's Day.</P><P>Once again, the numbers related to these things are very meaningful. There were thirty chambers. Thirty is composed of five times six. This means it is composed of man multiplied by responsibility. Furthermore, it also is composed of three times ten, meaning the Triune God in resurrection fulfilling all the requirements. Our Christ is the number thirty. If He were only the number five or six or three, He would not be so rich. But He is the number thirty, including six, five, three, and ten. We have such a rich Christ for our enjoyment. In Him we have man signified by the number six. In Him we have the Triune God signified by the number three. In Him we have resurrection signified also by the number three. In Him we have responsibility signified by the number five. Also, the number ten signifies that in Him we have the perfection and fulfillment of God's requirements. In Him we have the completeness and the perfection. What a Christ we have! The thirty chambers for enjoyment correspond to the thirty sides of the posts. Because our Lord Jesus can support so much, He can be our enjoyment to such an extent. He can stand and sustain and support and bear so much; therefore, He can be our enjoyment to that extent. Remember, there were also thirty windows in the gates, signifying the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</P><P>According to the plot plan, the width of the pavement is equal to the length of the gate. This signifies that the Christ whom we enjoy can only be the Christ whom we experience. How much we can enjoy Christ depends upon how much we have experienced Christ. If we experience Christ to the measure of fifty cubits, then the measure of our enjoyment of Christ will also be fifty cubits. How much we enjoy Christ depends on how much we have experienced Christ and passed through Christ. The more we pass through Christ, the more we have of Him to enjoy. We cannot enjoy a mere doctrinal Christ; we can only enjoy a Christ we have passed through and experienced. The measurement of the enjoyment of Christ is the measurement of how much Christ we have passed through.</P><P>Furthermore, all the pavements of the outer courts are connected to the gates, meaning that the enjoyment of Christ is connected to our experience of Christ. If we do not have the experience of Christ, we surely will not have the enjoyment of Christ. The pavement for enjoying Christ is by the two sides of the gate. All of our enjoyment of Christ depends upon our experience of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BOILING PLACES</H2><P>Furthermore, attached to the enjoyment of Christ in the outer court were the four boiling places in the four corners. This means that, by God's grace, the preparation of Christ for others to enjoy was spreading to every corner of the court. Every corner had a kitchen which was cooking Christ for others' enjoyment. Praise the Lord! The local churches are spreading to every corner of this country. Every corner of this country needs a boiling place to prepare Christ for peoples' enjoyment.</P><P>The measurement of the corner chambers was thirty by forty cubits. Thus, we have a new number, forty, which is the number of testing and trial. The people of Israel were tested in the wilderness for forty years and the Lord Jesus was tested in the wilderness for forty days. Apart from the Lord's suffering and trials, He could not have been prepared for us to enjoy. When the sisters prepare food in the kitchen, the food suffers. Christ passed through some suffering for our enjoyment. While He was on the earth and while He was dying on the cross, He was under the cooking and suffering for the sake of our eating.</P><P>At this point in the building we have the number thirty mentioned four times. There were thirty sides to the posts, thirty windows, thirty chambers, and now thirty cubits. This means that we must pass through Christ and then we must enjoy Christ. Whatever we enjoy of Christ must have been cooked; that is, it must be according to our experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INNER COURT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Another Set of Stairs</H2><P>From the outer court we pass into the inner court. As we enter, we also ascend higher. At the entrance to the inner court there was another set of stairs, this one consisting of eight steps. Outside on the street there were seven steps leading up to the gate of the outer court, and then there were eight steps bringing us to the inner gate of the inner court. This means that the more inward we travel, the higher we become. After we pass through the inner gate, we are fifteen steps higher than the people outside the wall. The number seven means perfection and completion, and the number eight indicates resurrection. This means if we would get into the inner court, we must be in resurrection. All the natural life and the natural man has to be repudiated and crossed out. We must be absolutely in resurrection. The staircase is in resurrection. Then we experience Christ again by passing through another gate. The second gate is not a different Christ, but simply more experience of Christ. This ushers us into the inner court.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Place for Washing the Burnt Offerings</H2><P>In the outer court there was some enjoyment of the Lord through the boiling and eating, but there was no service, no ministering to the Lord. When we come into the gate of the inner court, the ministering begins immediately. There is a chamber, probably within the north gate, for the priests to wash the burnt offering (40:38). It is not a place to kill or skin or to cut in pieces, but to wash the burnt offerings. The burnt offerings needed four steps of preparation: they were killed, skinned, cut into pieces, and finally, they were washed. After being washed, they were ready to be burnt. Thus, washing the burnt offering was the last step of the preparation. This chamber was not for killing, for skinning, or cutting in pieces, but for washing the burnt offering. This means at this point we are ready to be a burnt offering for God. We are now in resurrection and at a higher level; we are ready to be absolute for God. Only at this point are we really for God. In the outer court there was only the enjoyment of Christ, but in the inner court there was much improvement and progress. We are becoming more inward and also higher. The priests were ready to offer the burnt offerings, meaning that they were ready to be absolute for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Tables</H2><P>Also, within the north gate there were eight tables upon which the offerings were slain (40:39-41). Four were on one side and four were on the other side, making a total of eight. This was the real service of the priest. Today we all are the priests. According to our experience, though, when we were in the outer court, we were still only the people; we were not yet the priests. Only after we get higher and more inward, having the maturity in life, are we ready to be a burnt offering. At that point we can actually serve the Lord and minister to Him. At that point we become the priests and no longer simply the people. We become the priests ready to serve the Lord. There were eight tables signifying resurrection. The eight tables were divided into two groups of four and also into four groups of two. These numbers show the creature is in resurrection as a testimony. Four signifies the creature, eight signifies resurrection, and two signifies testimony. Therefore, we have the creature in resurrection as a kind of testimony.</P><P>The tables are one and one-half cubits square and one cubit high (40:42). The height of one cubit signifies the only, the unique, God. By adding the one and one-half cubits of the length to the one and one-half cubits of the breadth, we have three cubits. This indicates the Triune God in resurrection. He is the Triune God who was divided by His death. As a creature signified by the number four, He was split, yet He was resurrected, and now in resurrection He is a testimony. All our service and ministry must be in the Triune God, who was split and is now in resurrection. He is the living testimony as our ministry and our service.</P><P>Further into the court, there were two more chambers, one on the north side and another on the south side. The chamber in the inner court on the north side is for the priest who keeps the altar (40:46). The chamber on the south side is for the priest who keeps the house (40:45). The priests were divided into two groups. The first group took care of the temple, and the other took care of the altar. There were two separate chambers for these two groups of priests. This means that at this point, their service and ministry was settled, fixed, stable, and steady. They were fully qualified and steadfast in their ministry.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ALTAR</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 40:47; 43:13-17</H1><P>We need to consider two other points before we come to the altar itself. First, have you realized how many gates there are which open to the altar? All together, there are six gates in three groups of two. On the east side there are two gates, on the south side there are two gates, and on the north side there are two gates. Please remember that the number three signifies the Triune God in resurrection. The Lord Jesus resurrected on the third day. These six gates signify that the Triune God is mingled with man. Three is mingled with six. Three signifies the Triune God, and six signifies man created on the sixth day. Therefore, the six gates in three groups of two signify God mingled with man. The fact that the gates are divided into three groups of two indicates that the God-man was cut by crucifixion, but is now in resurrection. The Triune God became a man, was crucified, and is now in resurrection. He is now the gate through which we enter into God and into all the things of God.</P><P>Second, the distance from the outer gate to the inner gate is exactly one hundred cubits (40:47). The number one hundred is composed of ten times ten or twenty times five. Ten times ten signifies fullness in fullness and completion in completion. Twenty times five means full and complete responsibility as a testimony. Furthermore, there were three sections of one hundred cubits totaling three hundred cubits. On the south, there were one hundred cubits, on the north there were one hundred cubits, and on the east there were one hundred cubits, totaling three hundred cubits. Again, this signifies the Triune God. How wonderful and how meaningful it is that we are in such a God-man. He was crucified and yet He is now in resurrection and we are in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ALTAR</H2><P>No matter which gate you take to enter the compound, you will encounter the altar. Even if you enter with your eyes closed, you will hit the altar. The altar is at the very center of the compound. The altar is not only the center of the inner court, but is also the center of the whole premises of the temple. Do you realize that this altar, which signifies the cross, is also the center of the whole universe? Let me explain. The earth is the center of the universe as far as the relationship between God and man is concerned. On the earth the good land of Canaan, Palestine, is the center of the inhabited earth. It is the connecting center which connects the three main continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa. The city of Jerusalem is the center of that good land, and the temple compound is the center of Jerusalem. The altar, moreover, is the center of the temple compound. Thus, the altar is ultimately the center of the whole universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Signifying the Cross</H2><P>Because the altar signifies the cross, this shows us that the cross is the center of the whole universe. Do you know the real meaning of the cross? The superficial Christian teachings tell us that the cross is the place where the Lord Jesus died for us. This is surely true, but the cross means much more than that. As the center of the universe, the cross indicates the all-inclusive death of God, of man, and of all the creatures. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, it was not merely the death of one single person; it was the all-inclusive death of God, of man, and of all the creatures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Meeting Place of God and Man</H2><P>By looking at the plot plan of the temple compound, we can see that no matter through which gate we enter, we will arrive at the altar. And when God comes from the temple to meet man, He likewise, will arrive at the altar. The altar is not only the center of the whole universe, but also the meeting place of God with man and the meeting place of man with God. If I come in through the north gate, and you come in through the south gate, and someone else comes in through the east gate, we all will meet God at the altar. God also came out of His dwelling place, went to the cross, and died there. First, He left His dwelling place and came to Bethlehem to become a little child. He stayed on this earth for thirty-three and one-half years, and eventually He went to the altar, to the cross. But while He was dying there, He was not alone. By His incarnation, He had put man upon Him, so that while He was dying on the cross, man was also dying there. Thus, God and man met together on the cross in the way of death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Death Being a Release to God</H2><P>God, however, can never be affected by death. Regardless of how much death He passes through, He will remain the same. Death simply helps Him to be released. Do not think that death is always bad; sometimes death is good. Sometimes death releases. When a grain of wheat is sown into the earth, it dies. Is the death of that grain terrible, or is it wonderful? We have to say that the death of that grain is wonderful because, without death, all the riches and all the beautiful things in the grain could never be released. By death, the life and all the riches of the grain are released. Thus, it is not a terrible death, but a wonderful death. Death is wonderful to God. The Lord Jesus said that unless a grain of wheat were to fall into the earth and die, it would remain alone; but if it were to die, it would be multiplied into many grains (John 12:24). He was speaking of Himself as the one grain who would fall into the ground and die to bring forth many grains. By His death, the riches of His life were released. When God went to the altar, to the cross, and died, His life was released.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Death Being a Termination to Man</H2><P>On the other hand, man was also on the cross. When the Lord Jesus died, man also died, and this death meant the termination of man. All the negative things related to man were terminated there. Hallelujah! We all were terminated on the cross. By the all-inclusive death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, we were terminated and all the riches of God were released. The all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross is a wonderful release to God and a wonderful termination to us. The riches of God were released there, and the negative things were terminated there. Therefore, the all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross is our termination and God's release.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Mingling God with Man and Man with God</H2><P>The mingling of God with man began when the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem. By His incarnation, God came into man. But the mingling of man with God began on the cross and was fully accomplished at the resurrection. By the Lord Jesus' death and resurrection, we were mingled with God. We were put into God. Thus, by incarnation God came into man, and by death and resurrection, man was put into God. Hallelujah! All that we are and all that we have was terminated on the altar, and all that God is was released to us by His resurrection. Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! If we bury both a grain of wheat and a small stone, a plant will grow out of the grain of wheat and the small stone will simply be terminated. This is our history. Through the death of the cross the Lord as a grain of wheat was released, but we, as a small dead stone, were terminated. Hallelujah for the cross!</P><P> We have been terminated, and His life has been imparted to us. Hallelujah! This is marvelous. Now we are wonderful persons! Before we were saved, when we were outside of the wall of the temple compound, we were not wonderful. Rather, we loved ourselves so much. But once we were saved and passed through the gate into the outer court, although we no longer loved ourselves so much, still we had a certain amount of pity on ourselves. But when we get into the inner court, we no longer love ourselves or pity ourselves, but rather we hate ourselves. As we walk further and come to the altar, we can see that the ugly self whom we loved on the street, whom we pitied in the outer court, and whom we hated in the inner court has already been terminated. It has been terminated, so why should we love it or pity it or even hate it? Let us simply forget about our poor self. Let us leave it alone on the altar. We all need this vision of the altar. We need to see that, whether we are young or old, we were terminated on the cross at the same time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE ALTAR</H2><P>How can we prove from the account in Ezekiel that God and man and all the creatures died on the altar, on the cross? How can we prove that the death of Christ was such an all-inclusive death? We can prove this according to the design and the measurements of the altar. The clear details of the altar are a special characteristic of Ezekiel's vision. In earlier books, the Bible did not speak specifically about the measurements of the altar, but Ezekiel gives us details concerning the altar. (See altar detail.) According to Ezekiel's vision, the altar has four sections: the base, the lesser ledge upon the base, the greater ledge upon the lesser ledge, and the upper altar upon the greater ledge. The upper altar is also called the hearth of God, the place where something burns for God and by God.</P><P>The base of the altar is one cubit high. Since we know that the number one signifies the unique God, we therefore see that God is the base of the altar. This means that the cross was initiated by God. The lesser ledge, which is upon the base of the altar, is two cubits high. Here, the number two signifies not only testimony, but also the second Person of the Triune God. Christ is the second Person of the Triune God as a witness. Because the third section, the greater ledge, is four cubits high, it signifies all the creatures. The upper altar on top of the greater ledge is also four cubits high. This indicates not only the creatures, but also something more. The top of the altar is a square, twelve by twelve cubits. Twelve is composed of either six times two or of three times four. In this case both of the meanings are used. The number four signifying the creature, the number six signifying man, and the number three signifying the Triune God are all here. Thus, God is here, Christ is here, and all the creatures including man are here. God as the base included Christ. Christ included man and all other creatures. When Christ died upon the cross, all the creatures including man and God died there with Christ. This altar signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ: man died there, all the creatures died there, Christ died there, and God died there.</P><P>There are many different opinions concerning the death of Christ. An unbelieving Jew may simply say that a man whose name was Jesus, the Nazarene, died there. Some believers in the denominations may say that their Redeemer died there. Some advanced Christians may say that Christ, their Redeemer, and they themselves died there. But I would like to declare to you that not only Christ, my Redeemer, and I died there, but also all the creatures and even God Himself died there. The whole universe with the Creator passed through death. Everything passed through death. By passing through death everything was tested. Whatever could be terminated through death was terminated. We must realize that only God was able to pass through that test of death! I was terminated there, you were terminated there, the whole creation was terminated there! Hallelujah! God was able to pass through the test of death!</P><P>The all-inclusive death of Christ was a mingling which brought man into God. In that death God died in man to be released, and man died in God to be terminated. Hallelujah for His releasing and terminating death! In His death we were terminated, and in His death God was released.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Hearth</H2><P>The top of the altar is twelve cubits square and is called the hearth. This is the fireplace of God, the place to burn things for God, to God, and by God. It is meaningful that the hearth measures twelve cubits by twelve cubits. This is the first time the number twelve is used in the temple measurements. We have seen the numbers two, three, four, five, six, eight, and ten, but we have not seen the number twelve until this point. The number twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem and is composed of three times four. The number three is the number of the Triune God and the number four is the number of man as the creature. Twelve signifies the Triune God mingled with man. The New Jerusalem will be the consummate mingling of the Triune God with man. The church life today is also the mingling of the Triune God with man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Greater Ledge</H2><P>The greater ledge, which is the section directly under the upper altar, has an edge on either side which measures one cubit. This is why the greater ledge is fourteen cubits wide. The number fourteen is composed of seven times two or ten plus four. Seven is the number of completion, two is the number of testimony, and ten is the number of fullness in perfection. Four, of course, is the number of the creatures. By putting these numbers together we can realize that the creature in fullness bears a complete testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Lesser Ledge</H2><P>Under the greater ledge is the lesser ledge, which also has two edges of one cubit each, making it a total of sixteen cubits wide. Sixteen is composed of two times eight meaning a witness in resurrection. Christ is a living witness in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Base</H2><P>The base also has two edges measuring one cubit each making it a total of eighteen cubits wide. Eighteen is composed of six times three, signifying man and the Triune God. Because of the unique design of the altar, it is very solid and stable. It is wider at the base than it is at the top. The base is eighteen cubits square, the lesser ledge is sixteen cubits square, the greater ledge is fourteen cubits square, and the altar is twelve cubits square. This type of construction makes the altar very stable. If the top were wider than the bottom, it would not be stable. But because the bottom is much wider than the top, it can stand solidly and nothing can shake it.</P><P>Furthermore, on every story, on every section, of the altar are the edges which are spreading out like two arms to hold something. The borders on the edges also rise up to hold something. This is such a clear picture. The altar is not only solid and stable, but it is also able to hold things. The death of Christ on the cross is not only stable and solid, but also able to hold things. It is able to hold all of us. We all need to pray-read these verses and to study the chart. What a wonderful, marvelous, all-inclusive death!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Horns</H2><P>At each of the four corners of the hearth of God, a horn points upward. In the Bible, horns signify strength and power. The horns on the altar, which are toward the four corners of the earth and are also upward, signify the power of the cross of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Steps</H2><P>The steps up to the altar are toward the east. The east indicates the glory of the Lord. It is the direction of the rising of the sun which signifies the glory of the Lord (Num. 2:3; Ezek. 43:2). The cross always points toward God's glory and always leads us to God's glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Cubit of Measurement</H2><P>The cubit used by Ezekiel is not the common human cubit, but is a cubit plus a handbreadth (43:13). This is called a great cubit and is the divine measurement. It is not man's measurement, but God's measurement. You may feel that, according to your human measurement and standard, you are qualified; but according to the divine measurement, you still fall short. The altar is not measured by the human cubit, but by the divine cubit. Never measure yourself by your human measurement. Your human measurement may be of value to you, but it is of no value to God. According to God's measurement, you still fall short.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ALTAR AND THE TEMPLE</H2><P>The last point is the relationship of the altar with the temple. Only after passing through the altar, can we come to the temple. This means that without the proper realization and experience of the cross of Christ, it will be difficult for us to have the reality of the church life. The temple signifies Christ in the church life, and it comes only after the experience of the altar. If we desire to have a proper church life, we need an adequate realization and experience of the cross of Christ. After we are thoroughly terminated on the cross, we will have the proper church life. To be in the outer court having the enjoyment of Christ is wonderful, but it is still far from the experience of the temple. To be even in the inner court where the ministry has begun is also wonderful, but it also is far from the experience of the temple. We must go on and on until we pass through the altar and come to the temple; there we will have the reality of the church life. In order to have a rich and full church life, we must pass through the altar, through the cross of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TEMPLE AND THE SIDE CHAMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 40:48-49; 41:1-20, 25-26</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEMPLE</H2><P>After we have passed the altar, which signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ, we come to the temple itself. The temple is mainly composed of three sections: the porch, the outer temple, which is called the holy place, and the inner place, which is called the Most Holy or the Holy of Holies. In addition to this, there is an attachment which Ezekiel called the side chambers. The side chambers surrounded the whole building of the temple. Thus, the temple is composed of three sections with an attachment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Steps</H2><P>Ten steps lead up to the porch, which tells us that the compound of the temple has three levels (40:49, some versions). It has the first level in the outer court, the second level in the inner court, and the third level in the temple. The ground floor of the temple is on the third level. Remember also that the street outside the wall of the temple compound is at an even lower level. Thus, the street is the first level, the outer court is the second level, the inner court is the third level, and the ground floor of the temple is the fourth level. This picture shows us the elevation of the temple. This also shows us that the further inward we travel in the temple, the higher we rise. When we are outside the wall, we are on the lowest level. But when we enter and progress inward, we continue to rise higher. When we go from the street to the outer court, we must ascend seven steps higher; when we go from the outer court to the inner court, we must ascend another eight steps higher; when we go from the inner court into the temple, we must ascend an additional ten steps higher. The temple is twenty-five steps above the street level. As we travel inward, we also ascend higher. Although we must climb twenty-five steps from the street level to the level of the temple, we actually ascend only fifteen cubits in height. We can calculate this because the ten steps to the temple are equal to the height of the platform of the temple. In 41:8 Ezekiel said that he saw an elevation of the temple which was six cubits high. This equaled the height of the ten steps. The platform, which was six cubits high, was the base of the whole building of the temple and the side chambers. The ten steps in height equaled the six cubits. Thus, the twenty-five steps from the street level to the level of the temple should be fifteen cubits.</P><P>Again, the numbers mentioned in these chapters are very significant. Twenty-five is five times five, which indicates responsibility within responsibility. Fifteen is five times three, indicating the responsibility borne by the Triune God in resurrection. By putting these pieces of the puzzle together, we can understand that the way to ascend higher and higher in the temple is by the responsibility within the responsibility borne by the Triune God in resurrection. We have no way to ascend higher and to progress further inward apart from the Triune God bearing responsibility in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Two Pillars</H2><P>From the steps we go on to the two pillars, which we must differentiate from the posts of the temple (41:21). The posts are square, whereas the pillars are round. While the measurements of the posts are given, they are not given concerning the two pillars. Ezekiel gave us no measurement of the pillars, indicating that they must be unlimited. The pillars signify Christ as God's witness bearing the house of God in the universe with a strength which is unlimited and immeasurable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Porch</H2><P>Now we come to the porch itself. Ezekiel 40:48 says, "And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side." Here we have two posts which measure five cubits each. The number five indicates responsibility, and the number two indicates testimony; thus, the meaning of these two posts is responsibility in testimony. The height of the porch was twenty cubits, and the entry of the porch was fourteen cubits. The number fourteen is composed either of seven times two or of ten plus four. Seven means completion; two means a testimony; ten means fullness; and four means the creatures. Thus, the porch also signifies that the creatures bear a complete testimony in fullness.</P><P>I would like to point out one more thing concerning the porch. The porch is used as a lobby. This makes the temple easy to approach. In the church life we must have a lobby, a porch, making it easy for people to come in. We must have an atmosphere that is stretching out and making it easy for people to touch and contact us. A proper lobby enables us to take people in and to hold people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Outer Temple</H2><P>Having passed through the porch, we come to the outer temple where the entrance measures ten cubits (41:2). The first entrance, that of the porch, measures fourteen cubits, but the second entrance to the outer court measures ten cubits. This indicates that the further inward you progress, the more narrow the way becomes. The entry of the inner temple is even narrower, measuring six cubits. According to Ezekiel 41:2 there were five cubits on the sides of the doors. There were two posts measuring five cubits indicating responsibility in testimony. The length of the outer temple was forty cubits, and the breadth was twenty cubits, making a total of eight hundred square cubits. The number eight hundred indicates one hundred times resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Entries</H2><P>The first entry, the entry of the porch, was fourteen cubits wide; the second entry, into the outer temple, was ten cubits wide; the third entry, into the inner temple, was six cubits wide (41:3). According to this picture, the further inward we travel, the narrower the entry becomes. These figures are very meaningful. If we are outside the porch, we have no restriction, but when we come inside the porch, we have some restriction. That restriction, however, is not so narrow; it is still fourteen cubits wide. But when we pass from the porch to the outer temple, the entry is narrowed to ten cubits. Finally, when we travel further and reach the inner temple, the entry is narrowed to six cubits. According to our experience we know that the closer we get to the Lord, the more we are restricted by Him. If we are able to be loose and sloppy, it is a sign that we are away from the presence of the Lord. The closer we get to the presence of the Lord, the more we will be restricted.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Inner Temple</H2><P>From the outer temple we proceed to the inner temple. Ezekiel 41:3 says, "Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits." The post of the door measured two cubits, indicating testimony. The door was six cubits high and seven cubits broad.</P><P>According to 41:4 the inner temple was twenty cubits square. The Holiest of Holies in the tabernacle in the wilderness was a square (Exo. 26), and the Holiest of Holies in the temple that was built in the good land was also a square (2 Chron. 3:8). The wall of the house, according to verse 5, measured six cubits, signifying the humanity of the Lord Jesus. The humanity of the Lord Jesus is the standing strength of God's dwelling place. In the tabernacle, the acacia boards standing upright signified the humanity of the Lord Jesus (Exo. 26:15). The wall of the temple also signified the humanity of Jesus. Jesus as a proper human being is the wall. He is the standing and supporting wall.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIDE CHAMBERS</H2><P>Ezekiel 41:5 says, "After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side." On the south, the west, and the north sides of the temple were the side chambers in three stories. There were three stories, each having thirty side chambers, making a total of ninety side chambers. According to the diagram the wall of the temple was in three sections: the first floor of the wall was six cubits wide, the second floor of the wall was five cubits wide, and the third floor of the wall was four cubits wide. Because these were set one upon the other, a ledge of one cubit was created, and the beam of the side chambers was placed upon that ledge. The beam of the first story of the side chambers was put on the first ledge, and the beam of the second story of the side chambers was put on the second ledge. As the side chambers which surrounded the house increased in height, they also increased in breadth. The lowest side chamber was four cubits wide, the second story of the side chambers was five cubits wide, and the third story of the side chambers was six cubits wide. The breadth of the temple, however, continued straight upward with no change. As the side chambers went higher, they also became broader. This indicates that as we go higher and higher with the Lord, we also become broader and richer in our experience. As we progress inward we ascend higher, and as we ascend higher we become broader and broader. Because the side chambers at the first level were four cubits broad, they signify us as the creatures in a general way. But as we become higher and broader, we become the number five bearing some responsibility. The number four becomes the number five. Then as we go higher and broader, we become the number six, the proper man created by God on the sixth day. This means that we will be in the same measurement as the Lord Jesus, the wall. In the church life we do need the proper humanity of the Lord Jesus. Merely to be a creature is not sufficient, and merely to bear some responsibility is not sufficient; we all must become a proper man bearing the number six.</P><P>According to 41:8, around the house there was an elevation which was a platform or a base on which the temple and all the side chambers were built. This elevation was six cubits high, signifying again the humanity of the Lord Jesus. The humanity of the Lord Jesus is the foundation, the base, and the wall.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being the Fullness of the Temple</H2><P>The beauty of the temple is in the side chambers. If all the side chambers were removed, the temple would become too simple, having no beauty. The side chambers indicate the fullness of Christ. According to Ephesians 1:23, the church, the Body of Christ, is His fullness. If there were no chambers to the temple, there would be no fullness to the temple. The ninety side chambers in the three stories express the fullness of the temple. To strip off the ninety side chambers would be to strip off the fullness from the temple. Do you realize that the beauty of Christ is the church, the Body, as His fullness?</P><P>Do you remember the significance of the number thirty? There were thirty chambers on the pavement, thirty windows in the gates, and thirty sides of the posts in the gates. All these figures mean that we can only enjoy as much Christ as we have experienced and that we can only express as much Christ as we have enjoyed. The side chambers are the fullness of Christ, the expression of Christ. The side chambers typify the church as the fullness of Christ, His expression. We can only express Christ as much as we have enjoyed Him. The thirty side chambers for expression are based upon the thirty chambers of enjoyment. There were thirty dining chambers. This indicates we can express Christ only as much as we enjoy Him. We cannot express more of Christ than we have enjoyed. The enjoyment of Christ eventually becomes the fullness and the expression of Christ. The thirty chambers on the pavement signify the enjoyment of Christ, and the thirty side chambers attached to the building indicate the fullness and the expression of Christ. We only express what we have enjoyed of Christ. Our expression of Christ can never exceed our enjoyment of Christ. Our enjoyment becomes our expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Signifying the Triune God in Resurrection</H2><P>Furthermore, the side chambers are in three stories, signifying the Triune God in resurrection (41:6). We express Christ in the Triune God and in resurrection. When we are really in the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;and when we are really in resurrection, we express Christ with all our enjoyment of Christ. The thirty side chambers were in three sections. Twelve chambers were on the south side, twelve were on the north side, and six were on the west side. These numbers are very meaningful. Here is twelve, and here is five times six.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LATTICED WINDOWS WITH THE PALM TREES</H2><P>Now we come to the latticed windows with the palm trees. The windows are for letting in air and light and are for blocking out all the negative things (41:16). These signify Christ as the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is so free and so liberated, yet there are the lattices. There is the liberty, but there is also the screen. Whatever is heavenly, of life, and of the pure clean air can come in. But whatever is dirty, evil, and negative will be blocked out because it is a latticed, a screened window. This is how Christ as the life-giving Spirit operates within us.</P><P>On all the windows were the palm trees, signifying victory, everlasting power, and everlasting strength (41:18-20). The victory and the everlasting power always go together with the air and the light. This means that our victory and power are related to the life-giving Spirit. If we are enjoying the life-giving Spirit, surely we are enjoying the victory, the everlasting power, and the strength of the Lord Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPACE LEFT</H2><P>Ezekiel 41:9 says that outside the side chambers there was a place or space left. This signifies the riches of Christ. No matter how much you need Christ and how much He fills your needs, something will be left. Twelve baskets will be left over. In John 6, after the Lord satisfied the hungry ones, there were twelve baskets left over. The space left on the three sides of the chambers are the twelve baskets. The Lord is never scarce; He is always rich with something left over. This is wonderful. Behind this space of five cubits, there is also another space of twenty cubits. This means that after you have twelve baskets left over, and you feed others again, you may have forty-eight baskets left over. The Lord Jesus is always richer and richer. We can never exhaust Christ. The more we try to exhaust Him, the more space is left. When we enjoy Him once, we have five cubits left. When we enjoy Him again, twenty cubits are left. Christ will never become less; He always becomes more and more and more. The ministry is always richer and richer as the years go by because Christ is so rich.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DOORS</H2><P>Although there were ninety chambers, there were only two doors (41:23). There were not many exits. This indicates that it is easy to get in, but it is not easy to get out. There is no back exit or side exit or fire exit, but there are many windows. There were more than ninety windows, but only two doors. It is so easy to be a doorkeeper here because there are only two doors. Furthermore, it says that the doors are toward the space left. If there were no space left, there would be no way to open the door. Hallelujah. Christ is so rich.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BUILDING AT THE BACK,<br>THE INCENSE ALTAR,<br>THE HOLY CHAMBERS,<br>THE BOILING PLACES, AND THE WALLS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 41:12-20, 22-25; 42:1-20; 46:19-20</H1><P>In this chapter we need to cover the building which is at the back of the temple, the incense altar within the temple, the holy chambers on both sides of the temple, the two boiling places where the priests prepared the offerings, and the walls.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BUILDING AT THE BACK OF THE TEMPLE</H2><P>In 1961 I spent many hours considering and looking to the Lord to discover the meaning and purpose of the building at the back of the temple (41:12-14). Sometimes it is very meaningful to know what the Bible does not say. We can discover the meaning and purpose of most of the buildings in Ezekiel, but no matter how much we read this record, we cannot find a hint concerning the meaning and purpose of the building at the back. It is very mysterious! It is the biggest building; it is even bigger than the temple. The temple measures one hundred by sixty cubits, but the building at the back measures one hundred by eighty. It is larger than the temple, and yet the record does not tell the purpose of the building.</P><P>As I was studying this building, the Lord showed me that it signifies the riches of Christ. Let me illustrate: if I come to visit you and you do not have a room for me to stay in, but you ask me to sleep on your sofa in the living room, it indicates that you are not rich. But if I come to your home and you say, "Praise the Lord, Brother Lee! We have many empty, vacant rooms. This spacious, vacant room is just for you!" This would indicate that you are rich. Our Christ is likewise very rich! He is able to fulfill all the requirements and meet all the needs of both God and man and still have a large building left. This indicates that Christ is rich with something left over. Christ is all the building with something left over. Do you think that Christ as the building of God is only as much as we need? In principle, Christ as the building must have something left over. What is left over should be even bigger than what is used. Do not forget that five loaves fed five thousand people with twelve baskets left over (John 6:12-13). The amount left over was greater than the amount on hand at the beginning. Do not think that Christ is so limited. Praise the Lord! Behind all that you need is an even bigger portion of Christ that is vacant. It is not like today's apartments which put out a sign saying, "no vacancy." With Christ the sign always says "vacant" because He is so rich. The size of the building is very meaningful. It is one hundred cubits by eighty cubits. Eighty is ten times eight. Eight signifies resurrection and ten signifies fullness. This indicates resurrection in fullness and it is one hundred times eighty. In other words, it is one thousand times of resurrection. The wall is five cubits thick on all four sides making the capacity of the building seventy by ninety cubits (41:12). These numbers are also very significant. Seventy is ten times seven, ninety is ten times nine, and nine is three times three. These numbers indicate completion, fullness, resurrection, and the Triune God. What a rich Christ!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WALLS OF THE TEMPLE</H2><P>According to the record in Ezekiel, all the parts of the building related to the temple, including the temple proper, the porch, the side chambers, the back building, and all the walls are covered, wainscoted, with wood (41:16). When you enter into the temple, you can see nothing but wood. This temple is absolutely different from Moses' tabernacle. If you entered into the tabernacle raised up by Moses, you would see gold everywhere. Every part was overlaid with gold (Exo. 26:29). But in this temple, every part is overlaid with wood. Gold signifies the divinity of God, and wood signifies the proper humanity of the Lord Jesus. This is marvelous! I would like to remind you that Ezekiel is a book full of humanity. In chapter one, Christ on the throne was a man. Even in His glory, Christ was revealed as a man. Furthermore, when the glory came back to the temple, the man was there (43:2, 6). That man was the Lord Himself. In God's building the primary building material is humanity. We have to be human, but not humanly human; we have to be "Jesusly" human. The proper humanity is not our natural humanity, but the crucified, resurrected, and ascended humanity of Jesus. In this record concerning the temple, the number six is used many times. Nearly every entrance, gate, and threshold has the number six. The guard rooms were six by six, and the thirty chambers on the pavement were five by six. The number six signifies the humanity of the man Jesus. The inside of the entire temple was covered with wood, signifying His humanity.</P><P>The record does not tell us what kind of wood was used for wainscoting. In like manner, it is really difficult to describe the kind of humanity the Lord Jesus had. His humanity was marvelous! We cannot describe it, but we can see it, and we also have it. Praise the Lord! This is wonderful!</P><P>On all the wooden wainscoting, cherubim and palm trees were carved (41:18-20). The cherubim are the four living creatures mentioned in chapter one, signifying the glory of the Lord manifested upon the creatures. Among the cherubim were the palm trees, signifying the victory of Christ, the everlasting and ever-existing power of Christ. In chapter one the cherubim had four faces, but in the carvings on the walls, they have only two faces: the man's face and the lion's face. The man's face signifies and expresses humanity, and the lion's face shows victory in humanity. Hallelujah! The wall is covered with cherubim and palm trees carved into it. These are not paintings on the wood, but carvings. We need to be carved by the Lord. We are the pieces of wainscoting, and we need to be carved by the Lord. To be carved means to suffer something. When you meet certain brothers and sisters, you have the impression that upon them there is some carving of the Lord. The victory of Christ and the glory of the Lord have been carved into them. The everlasting power, the freshness, and the evergreen life have been carved into their being. Because of the Lord's carving, they bear this kind of image and impression wherever they go.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WOODEN INCENSE ALTAR</H2><P>The incense altar is made wholly of wood. Every part, even the horns, is made of wood (41:22). It is altogether different from the incense altar made by Moses. Moses made a wooden altar overlaid with gold, signifying the humanity overlaid with the divinity (Exo. 37:25-26). But the incense altar standing in this temple is made wholly of wood, signifying only the humanity of Jesus.</P><P>In the tabernacle and in the temple there were the altar, the lampstand, and the showbread table. But here the altar is also the table (41:22). It serves as an altar for us to offer something for us. The one altar has two purposes. For us to God, it is the altar; for God to us, it is the table. We offer something of Christ to God upon it, and God prepares something of Christ for us upon it. Both are upon the humanity of Christ. Whatever is put upon the table or upon the altar must be Christ. Christ on the altar is the incense for God, and Christ on the altar is food for us. When we offer Christ to God upon it, it is the altar for God's satisfaction. When God prepares something of Christ for us upon it, it is the table for our satisfaction. Christ on the altar is the incense to God, and Christ on the table is food to us.</P><P>The main point is that both the walls and the incense altar were covered with wood, signifying the proper humanity of the Lord Jesus. The wooden incense altar was three cubits high and two cubits long. This signifies the Triune God in resurrection as a testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO LAMPSTAND</H2><P>In this temple there is no lampstand for giving light. In the old tabernacle, within the holy place there was no window or opening, so it needed the lampstand. But in this temple there are many windows letting in light and fresh air. Therefore, there is no need of the lampstand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DOORS</H2><P>Both the outer temple and the inner temple had doors at the entrance (41:23). At both gates there were two doors, each of two folding sections. The gates were simply openings, but within the gates were doors which could be opened and closed. When the positive people such as the apostles come, surely you have to open the door, but when the negative people such as the wolves come (Matt. 7:15), you have to close the door. Does the local church in your place have the doors? I am afraid that in your place you may have only walls and not gates. It may be that sometimes you simply cut a hole in the wall to let people in. Thus, you have a gate, but no doors. In the church life we need the gates with the doors. Whenever the positive people and the positive things come, we open to them. But when the negative people and the negative things come, we shut the door, refusing to let them in. The doors function in the same manner as screens on the windows. The doors are opened to let the positive things in, but they are closed to keep the negative things out. Each gate has two doors which are made of two pieces, making a total of four pieces on each gate (41:24). The fact that each door is made of two folding pieces is very meaningful. It means that it is very flexible. It turns and it folds; it is not stubborn. Sometimes in the local churches, the leading ones are stubborn. They do not know how to be folded and turned. The church needs the turning, folding, flexible doors that are easy to open and easy to shut.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HOLY CHAMBERS</H2><P>The holy chambers are the connecting buildings which connect the inner court with the outer court. They are located on both the north side and the south side (42:13). Each building consists of two rows which face one another with a walkway between. The many doors in the south building open toward the north, and the many doors in the north building open toward the south. Thus, it is the connecting building. The holy chambers are fifty cubits wide and one hundred cubits long with a walkway ten cubits wide between them.</P><P>The holy chambers are the places for the priests to eat the offerings (42:13). Remember, the chambers on the pavement in the outer court were the places for the people to eat the offerings, but these holy chambers are for the priests to eat the offerings. It is in these chambers that they eat the offerings, lay the offerings, store the offerings, and it is here that they lay their priestly clothing (42:14). In the chambers on the pavement, the people could enjoy Christ, but they could not express Christ because they did not have the priestly clothing. The priestly clothing signifies Christ being expressed and lived out. The offerings signify Christ as our enjoyment, and the clothing signifies Christ as our expression. The people in the outer court could enjoy Christ, but they could not live Christ out and express Him. In the holy chambers the priests have much improvement. They not only enjoy Christ, but they also live out and express Christ. They not only eat Christ, but they also live Christ. Furthermore, they have even the storage of Christ. By putting these things together we can see much improvement in the experience of Christ. On the pavement people simply enjoyed Christ with no storage and no priestly clothing. But in the holy chambers, the priests not only eat and enjoy Christ, but they also have Christ as their clothing and Christ as their storage.</P><P>The holy chambers, like the side chambers, are of three stories (42:5-6). In height they are equal to the side chambers. This corresponds to the fullness of Christ. The priests enjoy Christ, wear Christ, store Christ, and possess Christ to such an extent that the height of their chambers is the same as the side chambers, which signify the fullness of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO BOILING PLACES</H2><P>At the end, toward the rear of the temple, there are the two places for the priests to boil their offerings and to prepare and bake the meal offerings (46:19-20). These are the priestly kitchens. The kitchens for the people are at the four corners of the outer court, and the kitchens for the priests are these two places within the holy place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LAND SURROUNDING THE TEMPLE</H2><P>After the measuring of the temple was completed, Ezekiel was brought outside of the compound where the man measured the land outside the wall (42:15-20). The measurement of the land was not 500 cubits but 500 reeds. One reed equals six cubits. This means that land outside of the wall is 3000 cubits square, making a total of nine million square cubits. In the center, a square of only 5000 cubits was used, leaving a wide, spacious land surrounding the temple compound.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUSION</H2><P>The design of the temple compound gives a strong impression of separation. There was a wall around the spacious piece of land. That wall separated what was holy from what was common. Altogether, there were at least four walls: the wall around the entire lot, the wall around the outer court, the wall around the inner court, and the wall around the temple. They enclosed the temple and separated what was holy from what was common. The walls signify separation and sanctification. Thus, when a person enters into the temple, he has passed through a fourfold separation. What a great margin of separation there was! On every side of the temple compound, there was a spacious suburb of 1250 cubits reaching to the wall. This indicates the spaciousness of the separation in Christ.</P><P>Furthermore, the design of the temple gives an impression of progression. The further you travel inward, the higher you become. The higher you become, the broader and wider you also become. Thus, it is progressive. When you are in the temple, you are fifteen cubits higher than the ground level.</P><P>In the appearance of the temple there is also a clear impression of balance. There is nothing unbalanced. Rather, everything is square and upright. Nothing is crooked. This is the church life. The church life is a life of absolute separation, a life of progression, and a life of balance. It is upright, square, and straight.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RETURN OF GOD'S GLORY<br>TO THE HOUSE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 43:1-12; 44:4-5; 43:18-27</H1><P>After the completion of the building of the house, the glory of the Lord returned. In an earlier vision, Ezekiel had seen the glory of the Lord depart. First, the glory of the Lord left the temple and hesitated upon the threshold (9:3; 10:4). From the threshold it went out to the city. From the city the glory of the Lord went further out to the Mount of Olives on the east side of the city (11:23), and from there the glory ascended into the heavens (10:19). When the Lord in His leaving stopped on the threshold of the house, it indicated that He was not happy to leave. The Lord did not want to leave, but He was forced to leave. His staying at the threshold of the temple indicated His unwillingness to leave. He was lingering and hesitating, but eventually He was forced to leave because of the abominations, the whoredoms, the carcasses, and the degradation of the people. Hallelujah! Now the glory of the Lord is returning by the same way He left. He departed from the east side and now He is returning from the east side (43:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GLORY RETURNING TO THE HOUSE</H2><P>Why did the glory of the Lord return to the earth? It returned because the building of the temple was completed. This is a very important point! How much the Lord desires to come back to this earth! Yet, for His coming back He needs a place for the soles of His feet to rest. He needs a place upon which He can place His two feet. His habitation, His house, is the very place on this earth where He can put His feet. Through all the centuries the enemy in his subtlety has kept Christians from knowing anything about the building. Christian teachers stress greatly the matter of salvation and to some extent the matter of spirituality, but they rarely stress the matter of building. It is not merely a matter of salvation or spirituality; it is also a matter of the building. For years now the Lord has burdened us with one thing&#151;the building! the building! the building! What is the building? It is nothing other than the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Watchman Nee's Ministry Being for the House</H2><P>Brother Watchman Nee was surely committed by the Lord with the burden for the church. Many of us knew him very well, and we knew that he was burdened for the church and for the building up of the church. He realized that for the building up of the church, there was the need of the inner life. So the Lord gave him many messages on the inner life. These messages were not released so that people could be spiritual in an individual way, but so that the church could be built up. All of his inner-life messages were for the building up of the church. But the subtle enemy, Satan, has utilized a number of so-called spiritual people to publish many of his messages on the inner life to be used for individual spirituality. Those people who put out the inner-life books by Brother Nee do not have much regard for his books on the church life. Many of the Christian bookstores sell The Normal Christian Life, Sit, Walk, Stand, What Shall This Man Do? The Song of Songs, and so forth&#151;all books on the individual spiritual life&#151;but very few of them sell Brother Nee's books on the church. They seldom sell The Normal Christian Church Life, The Glorious Church, Further Talks on the Church Life, or other books by Brother Nee which have the word church in the title.</P><P> Have you seen the subtlety? Do you believe the Lord cares only for spirituality? Let me tell you that the Lord does not care for mere spirituality! The Lord cares for the building up of the church. We must expose the subtlety of the enemy. Some have said that Witness Lee is different from Watchman Nee&#151;that Watchman Nee is for the spiritual life, but Witness Lee is too much for the church. This is the subtlety of the enemy. Such a false accusation forced us to publish Further Talks on the Church Life, The Orthodoxy of the Church, and The Glorious Church, all by Brother Watchman Nee. These books exposed the false accusations. The sad thing is that those so-called Christian bookstores will rarely carry these books by Brother Nee. Some people on the east coast even sent out a circular letter notifying their customers that they did not carry Further Talks on the Church Life. How ridiculous to notify people of what products you do not sell!</P><P>The Lord today is not merely for the individual spirituality. Suppose many spiritual giants such as Daniel were raised up in Babylon by the river Chebar. Do you think the Lord's glory would go there and fill them? The glory of the Lord did not return to Daniel, but rather it returned to the temple after it was rebuilt.</P><P>After the completion and the measuring of the whole building, the Spirit brought Ezekiel to the east gate where he saw the appearance of the glory of the Lord returning. "And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face" (Ezek. 43:3). When I first read this word I felt surely the text must be wrong. I thought the "I" should be "He." To my impression it should read, "When He came to destroy the city." All of the best translations, however, used the pronoun "I." It seems so strange that Ezekiel would say that he came to destroy the city. Such a translation is very significant. It means that when the prophet went to Jerusalem, the Lord also went to Jerusalem. The Lord was going in Ezekiel's going.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Glory Returning from the East</H2><P>In his earlier ministry Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord leave the temple and the city, and in his later ministry he saw the glory coming back. The glory of the Lord returned from the east, that is, from the direction of the sunrise (43:2). The direction of the sunrise always signifies glory (Num. 2:3; Ezek. 43:2). The Lord came back from the glory. He left toward the east and He came back from the east.</P><P>The Lord returned not only with glory, but also with much noise. His voice was like the noise of many waters. Whenever the Lord's glory comes back to the church, there will be a lot of noise. When the glory of the Lord leaves the church, surely the church will be quiet. Quietness indicates that the glory has gone, but noise indicates that the glory has returned. In Acts 2, on the day of Pentecost, it was not quiet. A rushing, mighty wind and a sound, a voice, filled the house. Every time the church has a revival, there is some sound and some voice. After the voice came, "the earth shined with His glory" (43:2). The whole earth was under the light, under the shining of His glory. There was no darkness. It is so wonderful that in the church in Los Angeles in the past years, we have had the sensation that the glory of the Lord has come back. We also have had a lot of noise among us, and we have had the sensation that something is shining here. When you come into the church meetings in Los Angeles, you have the sense that you come, not into the darkness, but into the light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>His Appearance Being the Same</H2><P>Ezekiel 43:3 says that the appearance of the Lord was the same when He returned as when He came with the prophet to destroy the city. In appearance, He was the same. When the Lord Jesus comes to the church today, He is still the same as in the past. Then, it says that the Lord came in appearance as in a vision that Ezekiel saw by the river Chebar. This comforting word shows us how merciful the Lord was. Even while Ezekiel was in captivity, the vision of the Lord went there. The vision of the Lord came not only to the holy land, but also to the place of the captivity. In Zechariah 1:8 the Lord Jesus was riding on a red horse among the myrtle trees in the bottom. The Lord's people at that time were in a low place, in the bottom, but the Lord Jesus was riding among them to bring them out. The Lord Jesus was with those captives in the bottom, and He was also with those in the captivity by the river Chebar. The Lord was still with His people, but not in a normal way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The East Gate Being Open to the Glory</H2><P>After the building up of the house, the Lord came back to the holy land in a normal way. He came back by the east gate. In the church life we need several gates, but the most important one is the east gate. It is the east gate which is open to the glory of the Lord. We need a gate which is open to the glory of the Lord. The temple had three gates: one toward the east, one toward the south, and one toward the north. The gates on the south and the north are for the convenience of the people; but the gate toward the east is not only for the convenience of the people, but also for the glory of the Lord to come in. We should not care merely for the convenience of the people, we must care for the glory of the Lord. In the church life the first consideration we should have is the Lord's glory. Even a decision concerning what time or what day to have the meetings should not be concerned wholly with peoples' convenience. It should care for the Lord's glory. The decisions in the church must be made primarily according to the Lord's glory. The church must be open to the Lord's glory so that His glory may come into the church. Eventually the house and the inner temple were filled with the glory of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Lord's Strong Desire for His House</H2><P>Hallelujah! the Lord returned to the earth. Because He had lost His standing on the earth, He went back to the heavens. What is His standing on the earth? It is the building up of His house, the church. In order for the Lord to come back to this earth, He needs a built-up church standing on this earth. He will come back, not simply to this earth, but to the church. At that time Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord, and he also saw a man standing by him. He not only saw the glory of the Lord, he saw the Lord as a man. The man stood by him and said, "Son of man, the place of my throne" (43:7), proving that the man who stood by Ezekiel was the Lord Himself. It was a man who said, "The place of my throne." According to the grammatical construction, "the place of my throne, the place of the soles of my feet where I will dwell in the midst of the children forever," does not seem to be a good composition. It may be because the Lord's desire and joy was with His house, He neglected the grammar. He was fully occupied with His house.</P><P>Some people have said that Witness Lee is too much for the church. I feel that I am not enough for the church. The Lord was so happy with His house that He forgot about the grammar. Upon His return to the temple, He was very happy. Hallelujah! the house was recovered! the place was recovered! Hallelujah! Once more the Lord had a place for the soles of His feet! Oh, the Lord's desire is for the church! He has been desiring and waiting to come back to the church. This is why we have so much joy in the meetings, and this is why we are so happy and crazy in our meetings. It is because the Lord Jesus within us is also happy. He has a place, the place of His throne, and the place of the soles of His feet. Without the recovery of the proper church life, the Lord has no place for the soles of His feet. For centuries the Lord has simply been in the air with no place for the soles of His feet. How happy the Lord is now that in the local churches there is a place for the soles of His feet! If I had been Ezekiel I might have asked, "Lord, are You not the almighty God? Why do You care for such a small, narrow place only twenty by twenty cubits? Why are You so happy with this little place?" The Lord would answer, "I just love this place on the earth, I just care for this little place on the earth!" The Lord cares for the recovery of the church life! The place of the soles of His feet is also the place of His throne. The throne is for God's government and administration and kingdom. It is the place where He can administrate. The soles of the feet are for His move on this earth. Without the temple God has no base for His administration and no base for His move on the earth. Unless the church is built up, the Lord has no standing to administrate His government and to move upon this earth. Furthermore, this is the very place where the Lord can dwell for rest and satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PEOPLE'S WHOREDOM AND CARCASSES</H2><P>According to Ezekiel 43:7 the people, the house of Israel, had offended the Lord in two things: in their whoredom and in their carcasses. The Lord did not rebuke the house of Israel for their behavior and conduct, but for their whoredom and carcasses. Whoredom is fornication. For example, suppose a wife is nice, kind, truthful, and patient&#151;but besides her husband she loves and stays with another man. That is whoredom. To the church at Ephesus in Revelation 2, the Lord said that they had done many good works, but they had lost the first love. The Lord meant that, besides Himself, they loved some other things. That is whoredom. Regardless of how good or how pure or how holy something may be, if we love that thing more than we love the Lord Himself, it is a kind of whoredom. In Christianity, not many care simply for the Lord Himself. Rather, many care for other good, pure, fundamental, spiritual, and holy things. This caring is a kind of whoredom.</P><P>What then are the carcasses? The carcasses are the dead things. Verse 7 says, "neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places (of Zion)." We may add these two words "of Zion" as a kind of interpretation. It means the high places on Mount Zion. According to the custom, the carcasses of the kings were buried beside the temple. So the Lord says the threshold of the carcasses was close to His threshold. The post of their grave was close to His post in the temple. There was only one wall between. On one side was the Lord's sanctuary, and on the other side was the grave of the carcasses of the kings. These were not the carcasses of the lower people, but of the kings of high standard.</P><P>Let us apply this matter to today's Christianity. For example, the so-called church weddings with the wedding march, with the procession of the bride and the groom, with all the worldly attire, and with all kinds of dead things is a carcass of the king. When you attend that kind of wedding, you can sense the stinking of the carcasses. It is not the carcass of the lower people, but the carcass of a high standard, of the king. Then, on the next Lord's Day morning in their service, Miss Jones sings a solo. She comes to the front with a dress which exposes her bare shoulders, and she is painted with blue, white, and red as she stands there singing. That is really a carcass, really something dead. That is not a carcass of a lower standard, but of a higher standard, having a high education and a high standard of music. That is really a carcass of the king. When you listen to that kind of solo, do you have the sensation it is a praise to the Lord? When I was there, I only had the sensation of the stinking. Today's Christianity is full of whoredom, full of carcasses. Years ago, I visited Westminster Cathedral in London. Oh, that church building is full of carcasses. Even John Wesley's carcass was there. The carcasses of many famous people are buried under that roof. I told the British brother who brought me there that it was really a church of dead people. It was full of carcasses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEMPLE</H2><P>After pointing out these abominations, the Lord told Ezekiel how to instruct the people. He did not tell Ezekiel to teach God's people concerning the law and the Ten Commandments as He had Moses. Rather, He told Ezekiel to show God's house to the people (43:10). From now on, it is not a matter of the dispensation of the law, but of the dispensation of God's house. To keep the law is not good enough. You have to keep the form, the fashion, the ordinances, the statutes, the laws, the comings in and the goings out related to the house. Now your behavior must be according to God's house. You should not behave yourself merely according to the Ten Commandments. Now you have to behave yourself according to God's house. In Christianity, the lower teachings always teach people how to behave and what to do and what not to do. They have many rules of conduct. Then, in Christianity, there are also the higher teachings, teaching people to be spiritual. This is an improvement, but the Lord did not tell Ezekiel to show the law or the spiritual principles to the house of Israel. No! He said show My house to Israel. Today, it is not a matter of behaving ourselves or even a matter of being spiritual. It is a matter of fitting into the house. It is a matter of how we conduct ourselves in God's house. The Lord told Ezekiel to show them the house. The house must be their regulation. The Lord charged Ezekiel to show them the form, the fashion, even the comings in and the goings out, the statutes, and the laws.</P><P>Suppose a certain person gets saved. Before he was saved, he treated his parents and his sister poorly, but after he got saved, he learned how to treat them well. He also learned how to have good behavior and good conduct before his parents. Later, he learned to be spiritual, to reckon that he was dead, and so forth. He is good in conduct, he is even spiritual in some of the spiritual things, but he is very independent. He is so independent that he will not pray with you or even with his sister. Though he is nice, good, and in a sense spiritual, he is extremely independent. This means he is a person who knows nothing about the house; he cares nothing for the church. Whatever he does is absolutely for his own individuality; nothing is for the body, nothing is for the church, and nothing is for the Lord's corporate expression.</P><P>If such a person is measured by the house, he is short of the windows, that is, the life-giving Spirit. He needs to call on the Lord: "O Lord Jesus! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Jesus is Lord!" These are the windows. If he would call on the name of the Lord, he would be full of windows. Furthermore, this brother needs to be checked and compared with the doors of the house. It may be that he has more than two hundred doors. He has many exits out of the church life. Today he comes into the church life; tomorrow he goes out. After two days, he comes back. This means he has many doors. But the temple does not have that many doors. When we enter the church life, we must come in through one gate. After we enter the one gate, we progress further inward, and we ascend higher. When we reach the corner on the third floor at the rear, we cannot escape. There are no gates to get out. But this brother has many gates. He has no windows, but many gates. He would never shout, "O Lord Jesus, Hallelujah!" But he has so many doors to get out of the church life. We all have to be checked by the building in our comings in and goings out.</P><P>In the temple, the number six was used many times, signifying the humanity of the Lord Jesus. It was used with the wall; it was used with the entry; it was used with so many portions of the temple. We have to check our humanity by the building. We must take the Lord Jesus as our humanity.</P><P>In the building, there is not one independent piece. This is a very important point! Every piece of the material has been built in. Every piece is related to another piece. Not one piece is independent. But what about you? Have you been built into the building? Does your form and your fashion fit into the building? Do you say, "I like this, or I don't like that"? The question is not do you like it, but does it fit into the church. From now on, the house of Israel should behave themselves, not according to the law, but according to God's house. From now on, we also must behave ourselves not according to certain teachings, but according to the church. The church has to be our regulation. We have to be regulated by the fashion of the church, the form of the church, by the comings in and the goings out of the church, by the ordinances and the statutes and the laws of the church. We should not be God's people according to the law of Moses; we must be God's people according to the form of the temple in Ezekiel. The Lord told Ezekiel, "Son of man, show them the form of the house."</P><P>The Lord's concern today is not the law, but the house. His concern is not spirituality, but the church. We must fashion ourselves according to the church. Today the Lord only cares for the church, for the place of His throne, for the place of the soles of His feet, for the place where He can dwell for rest and satisfaction. Because the Lord only cares for His house, we also must care for His house. Do not care merely for the teachings from the Bible; do not care merely for the inner life; do not care merely for speaking in tongues or pray-reading; care absolutely for the church. Make yourself according to God's house, the church. The proper church life is the greatest test of real spirituality. If you cannot pass the test of the church life, your spirituality is not genuine. We have to see that the requirement of the indwelling Christ is not according to the law, but according to His house. Everyone must be measured and checked according to the measurement of God's house. We are not under the dispensation of the law of Moses; we are under the dispensation of the house. This is the age of the church; it is not the age merely of being spiritual. Now is the time for the church life. If what we are and what we do does not fit into the church, it amounts to nothing in the eyes of the Lord and is even an abomination to Him. It is a kind of whoredom. We have to fashion ourselves according to the church. We have to allow the church to measure us and check us in every aspect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ALTAR</H2><P>After the temple, we come to the altar (43:18-27). The altar was the place for God's people to be redeemed and consecrated. It took seven days for people to be purified, offering a sin offering with the redeeming blood every day. Then, on the eighth day, the day of resurrection, they had to consecrate themselves by offering a burnt offering. Following the burnt offering they enjoyed the peace offering as a feast between the Lord and His people. After the purification, the cleansing on the altar for seven days, on the eighth day in resurrection, the Lord's people were accepted by Him. They became a satisfaction to Him and also had a feast with Him. In the church life today, we need the purification and we need the consecration of the altar. We have to offer ourselves to the Lord as a burnt offering, meaning we are absolutely for the Lord. First, we must be cleansed, purged, and purified, and then we must consecrate ourselves to the Lord. To keep the temple, we need the altar. To preserve the church life, we need the purification and the sanctification of the cross.</P><P>The purification needed a time period of seven days, indicating that the purification cannot be done quickly (43:26). It takes a period of time for us to be purified and cleansed. We need a period of time to be kept away from all the negative things. Then on the eighth day, in resurrection, we must offer ourselves to the Lord as a burnt offering absolutely for His satisfaction. Following this, we can have a feast with the Lord, enjoying all the riches of Christ in the presence of God (43:27). From the eighth day onward, we can have a feast with the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUSION</H2><P>The law of the house could be summed up in two points: it must be upon the top of the mountain, and it must be most holy (43:12). The church life must be high, on top of the mountain all the time. It also must be holy, separated, and sanctified from anything worldly. We must check ourselves by these two points&#151;is our church life on top of the mountain, and is our church life most holy?</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRIESTS AND THE OFFERINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 44:9-30; 45:11-25; 46:1-7, 13-15</H1><P>In the last chapter, we saw that God cares for His house. His desire is toward His house. Therefore, our work, our behavior, and our person must also be according to the fashion, the form, the pattern, the statutes, and the laws of the house (43:10-12). This means that everything we do must be according to the church. The standard today is not personal spirituality or good behavior; the standard is the church. All that we are and everything that we do must be tested by God's house, the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRIESTS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Circumcised</H2><P>In this chapter, we need to consider the kind of person who is qualified to serve in the house of the Lord, and we need to consider the offerings made to the Lord. First, if we would serve the Lord in His house, the church, we need to be circumcised (44:9). Uncircumcised persons are not qualified to serve in the church. Circumcision typifies the dealings with the flesh, the natural man, and the old man by the cross. Circumcision to us is not the outward circumcision practiced by the Jews in the Old Testament, but is the dealing with our flesh, our natural man, and our old man by the cross. If your flesh, natural man, and old man have not been dealt with by the cross, you are not qualified to serve in the church life. Rather, you are considered by the Lord to be a stranger. You may be a real brother, but because you have not dealt with the flesh, with the old man, and with the natural man by the cross, the Lord regards you as a stranger. You are not qualified to serve in the church life. You need to bring this matter to the Lord and ask Him about your flesh, your natural man, and your old man. These things must be dealt with through the working of the cross. Only then will you be circumcised and qualified to serve the Lord in the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Going Astray with the People</H2><P>When the majority of the people went astray, some of the circumcised people also went astray (44:10). They were circumcised, but they went astray from God to idols by following those who went astray. Because they went astray, they were only half-qualified to serve the Lord. On the one hand they were qualified because they were circumcised; on the other hand they were not qualified because they went astray with the people to the idols. Their circumcision qualified them, but their going astray disqualified them. What was the Lord's attitude toward these half-qualified ones? The Lord said that such persons could serve in the house, but could not come near to the Lord or to the holy things (44:11-14). They could minister in the temple, by helping the people to present their offerings, but they could not come near to the Lord and serve Him directly. This is very meaningful and very serious. Today, some of the dear ones in the Lord's recovery are also half-qualified. In a sense they are circumcised, but in another sense they have gone astray with the majority of the people. Millions of Christians today have gone astray from the Lord to idols. And some of the dear saints have gone along with the people to go astray from the Lord to these idols. Because they have gone astray from the Lord, they have lost their qualification and position to serve the Lord in a direct way. They may still have a part in the church service, but it is an indirect service to the Lord.</P><P> We all must be like the sons of Zadok who were circumcised and absolutely faithful to the Lord. They never went astray, following the majority of the people. They were circumcised, honest, and faithful to the Lord all the time (44:15-16). Therefore, they could serve the Lord in a direct way. The Lord said that they could come near to Him and serve Him directly. They were not restricted to merely serve His people; they could serve the Lord Himself. This is marvelous! I hope that not one of us is only half-qualified. I hope that all of us will be fully qualified&#151;circumcised, honest, never going astray, never following the majority. To follow the majority is awful. The majority of Christians today have gone astray.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering the Fat and the Blood</H2><P>How do the circumcised, faithful, and qualified persons serve the Lord? First, they have to offer the fat and the blood of the offerings (44:15). The most precious part of the offering is the fat which typifies the precious Person of the Lord Jesus. The blood signifies the redemptive work of Christ, but the fat signifies His Person. The fat we present to God is the precious Person of Christ, and the blood we present to God is the redemptive work of Christ. Please remember that in typology, the fat of all the offerings typifies the precious Person of the Lord Jesus, and the blood typifies the Lord's all-inclusive redemptive work. In all our service to God, we must present the precious Person and the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus to Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Wearing Any Woolen Garment</H2><P>When the priests came in to minister to the Lord, they were not to wear any woolen garment (44:17). Instead, while they were in the Lord's presence serving Him, they had to wear a linen garment. According to the Bible, linen signifies a living and behavior that is pure, clean, and fine. The linen garment signifies our daily walk, our daily living, in the life-giving Spirit by the life of Christ. The priests were not to wear woolen garments because they would become too warm and would begin to sweat. According to Genesis 3:19, sweat is a sign of God's curse. Because fallen man is under God's curse, he must sweat. Under the curse, man is short of God's blessing. Therefore, man must sweat to produce something; he must exercise his own energy which causes sweating. In the Lord's service there is no need for us to use our own strength. When we use our own strength to endeavor and struggle, it proves that we are not under the Lord's blessing, but rather under the Lord's curse.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery, as we serve the Lord, we need to avoid and even escape from any kind of self-energy, self-struggle, and self-endeavor. Do not push anything. If something is from the Lord, surely the Lord will grant His abundant blessing upon it and He will work it out. The Lord Himself will work it out. There is no need for us to push and to endeavor and to struggle and to energize to such an extent that eventually we are fighting. In the church service we all have to be in the life-giving Spirit living by the life of Christ. We should not exercise our natural strength and push anything. On the contrary, many times we need to back off a little and to give in. This means that we give in to the Lord and then we put the Lord on the spot. We can tell the Lord, "Lord, if this burden is something of You, I will stay back, and You have to come in. You have to come forward. I will give in and You have to take up the burden. This will confirm my burden so that I may know it is really of You." There is absolutely no need for us to strive and fight in our service to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Being Defiled by Dead Persons</H2><P>In addition to this, a priest who would serve the Lord directly in His presence cannot be defiled by any dead person (44:25). Do not go to the dead persons. Do not touch the dead carcasses. Do you realize that some Christians are dead persons? They are dead and stinking. By going to such Christians and listening to them, you will become half-dead. Then a lot of stinking and death will come out of your own mouth. You will have nothing positive to say; you will only speak in a negative way. You will say that the elders are wrong, the co-workers are wrong, the young people are wrong, the old people are wrong, everyone is wrong. Your contact with such a dead person has caused you also to be dead and negative. Whenever you realize that you are with such people, you have to run away; otherwise, you will be defiled by their death. To be defiled by death is more serious than to be defiled by something sinful. If you touch something sinful, you can confess and apply the blood and right away you are cleansed. But when you are defiled by touching a dead person, it will take you at least seven days to be cleansed (Num. 19:11). You will need a period of time to be purified and purged from the stinking of death. I believe that you have had this kind of experience in the past. After talking only a short while with a certain person, you could not pray or function in the meetings for a week. You became half-dead. Be careful about spending time with dead persons. Stay away from them! Do not think that you can help the dead persons. No, rather, their death will spread to you. In some of the churches, a few saints are dead people. They are very alive to movies, to sin, to worldly things, and to negative talk&#151;but they are absolutely dead to the church. As far as the church life goes, they are really dead persons. Unfortunately, they are not yet buried. I hope they will soon be buried. If you would serve the Lord, you must keep yourself undefiled. Always stay away from dead persons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Their Hair Being Cut Short</H2><P>Another item concerning the priests who came near to the Lord is their hair. "Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads" (Ezek. 44:20). According to this verse, the priests should neither shave their head, cutting off all their hair, nor should they let their hair grow long. Rather they should poll their hair, which means to cut it short. According to 1 Corinthians 11:5, to cut off or to shave off all the hair signifies rebellion against the Lord's headship. When we serve the Lord, we should not be rebellious against His authority. We all must learn to submit ourselves to the Lord's headship. Thus, we need some amount of hair upon our head, signifying our submission to His headship. On the other hand the same chapter tells us that to have long hair indicates self-glory and self-dignity (1 Cor. 11:15). We may even use another term&#151;self-enjoyment. There is some subtlety of the enemy within the long hair styles of today. Do not think that this is simply a hippy-type hair cut. Satan, in his subtlety, is behind all these things. According to the Bible, long hair signifies beauty and glory. If a man keeps his hair long, it means that he is keeping his self-glory and self-dignity; he is fulfilling his self-pleasure and self-enjoyment. He simply enjoys his long hair.</P><P>Let us apply these two points. Suppose a brother says that he is not under anyone, that he is independent, and that he is equal to every other member in the Body. Perhaps he even quotes Matthew 23:8 where the Lord Jesus said that we are all brethren. For him to have such an attitude means that, spiritually speaking, he shaves off every bit of his hair and does not submit himself to the headship of the Lord. Yes, Matthew does say that we are all brethren, but 1 Peter 5:5 says that the younger should submit to the elder and that we all should submit to one another. To shave or to cut off all the hair signifies there is no submission in the local churches. We need the proper submission.</P><P>On the other hand to have long hair, signifying self-glory, is to desire and seek for leadership in the church life. These are the two problems in the church life. One is a shortage of submission, and the other is a kind of hunger and seeking for position and leadership. This is a seeking for self-dignity and self-glory. Some are seeking to be an elder or to be a leader. You have to realize that such seeking is not a glory; it is a shame. To seek after leadership, to hunt any kind of self-glory is a shame. This will kill us spiritually, and this will disqualify us from serving the Lord properly. If we want to be qualified to serve the Lord, we should not shave our head, meaning that we should have a proper submission. Likewise, we should not let our hair grow long, meaning that we should not seek after self-glory, self-dignity, position, and leadership. To have long hair signifies seeking and hunting for a position. Both the lack of submission and the seeking after a position damage the church life. Whoever is seeking leadership in the church life is fully disqualified and finished with the church life. Satan is so subtle! Spiritually speaking, we need to keep a moderate cut of hair: on the one hand we are under the proper authority submitting ourselves to the headship of Christ, and on the other hand we do not seek to be a leader. We simply minister life to others and support the church life by His grace. We do everything we can for the church, and yet we do not seek a position of leadership. Such an attitude is really marvelous! It is a shame for us to seek to be an elder or a leader in the church. This kind of seeking will cause us to lose our qualification to serve the Lord. We have to poll our hair, that is, to have a moderate cut.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Drinking Wine</H2><P>The priests who were qualified to minister to the Lord directly in His presence should not drink wine (44:21). Wine signifies worldly, physical pleasure, and joy. We should have nothing to do with worldly pleasure lest we lose our qualification to serve the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having Only God as Their Possession</H2><P>Furthermore, all these priests have only God Himself as their inheritance, their possession (44:28). We should not be content to have merely some physical, material possessions. In our concepts, our heart, our mind, our realization, and even in our practical living, we must consider that our God whom we serve is our only possession. He is our real possession, and He is our real inheritance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Enjoying the Riches of Christ</H2><P>Finally, all the priests enjoyed the riches of Christ. All the heave offerings, all the firstfruits, all the top produce of the people of the Lord belonged to the priests (44:29-30). All of the riches of Christ were for their enjoyment. They have God as their possession, and they have Christ in all His rich aspects as their enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OFFERINGS</H2><P>The responsibility of the priest was to present the offerings to God. The record in Ezekiel may seem to be peculiar. Moses told the people of the Lord to offer one lamb out of ten to God, but Ezekiel told them to offer one out of two hundred (45:15). This means that if you do not produce a large quantity of the enjoyment of Christ, you are not qualified to offer anything. Though you may produce 199 lambs, you are still not qualified to make an offering to the Lord. If you desire to offer one lamb, you must first raise up two hundred lambs. Your richness in the experience of Christ qualifies your offering. According to Moses' law, if you have ten lambs, you are qualified to offer one. But according to Ezekiel you must have twenty times more. You must have two hundred lambs in order to be qualified to offer one. I am afraid that none of us can come up to the standard in Ezekiel concerning the offerings.</P><P>The principle is the same with the wheat and the barley. Ezekiel 45:13 says, "This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of barley." One homer is equal to ten ephahs and the offering must be one sixth of an ephah. This means that you have to offer one part out of sixty. Moses' requirement was one out of ten, but Ezekiel's requirement was one out of sixty. Even if you have four ephahs of wheat, you are not qualified to offer anything: you must have at least a homer of wheat. Once you have a homer of wheat, then you can offer one-sixtieth to God. You must be rich in wheat. Moses' requirement did not force you to be so rich, but Ezekiel's requirement forces you to be very rich.</P><P>The offering of oil also required an abundant supply. Ezekiel 45:14 says, "Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is a homer of ten baths; for ten baths are a homer." One homer is equal to ten baths and you must offer one tenth of a bath of a homer. This means you offer only one percent, one out of a hundred. You must be rich in the produce of Christ in order to offer an offering of oil to the Lord. If you are not rich, you are not qualified. Of the wheat and barley, you must offer one-sixtieth; of the oil, you must offer one-hundredth; and of the lambs you must offer one two-hundredth.</P><P>Ezekiel only mentions three categories for the heave offering: the barley and wheat, the oil, and the lambs. The heave offering was heaved up into the air and signified the ascended Christ. This is the highest Christ. In our service to God we need to heave Christ. We have to offer the ascended Christ, the highest Christ, to God. In Moses' law, there were many kinds of heave offerings, but in Ezekiel's writing there were only these three categories: the wheat and barley, the oil, and the lamb.</P><P>In the book, The All-Inclusive Christ, we pointed out that wheat signifies the incarnated Christ who died for us. From the time of His incarnation to the time of His crucifixion, He was the wheat. Barley signifies Christ in resurrection, because in Palestine barley is the first grain to be harvested. Thus, barley signifies the firstfruit of resurrection. Jesus fed the five thousand with loaves made of barley (John 6:9). The wheat and the barley signify Christ from the time of His incarnation all the way to His resurrection. The oil, of course, signifies the Holy Spirit, and the lamb signifies the redeeming Christ. These are the main aspects of the heave offering which we need to offer in our service. All these are related to Christ. Christ is the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the lamb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>When to Offer</H2><P>According to Ezekiel's record there was the yearly offering, the monthly offering, the weekly offering, and the daily offering. The yearly offering was offered on the first day of the year signifying that, in principle, every year we should have a new beginning (45:18-19). Every year we need a fresh cleansing and clearing up. With the yearly offering there was a gracious part. The yearly offering was offered not only on the first day of the year, but also on the seventh day of the year (45:20). This indicated a period of graciousness for the people. Some were simply not ready on the first day of the year to fully clear up their situations and to be cleansed. Therefore, the Lord gave them another opportunity on the seventh day. If they missed the first day, they had the seventh day to make it up. This is wonderful! Keep in mind that, in principle, at the beginning of every year, we need to have a renewal in our service to the Lord. Though I do not want to present to you something legal, I would still like to share a testimony of my experience concerning this matter. In past years, my co-workers and I practiced to have a new beginning every year. On December 31, we spent the whole night together and prayed until the early hours of the first day of the year. During the night we had a thorough dealing with the Lord, confessing all our shortcomings, and during the early morning of the first day of the year, we consecrated ourselves freshly to the Lord. It is very good to have a new beginning on the first day of the year.</P><P>There was also the monthly offering at the time of the new moon. Whenever the new moon came, the offering had to be made (46:6). Not only do we need a new beginning yearly, but we also need a new beginning monthly. The new moon indicates a new beginning. Beyond this, we need a weekly offering. Every week we need a fresh offering to the Lord. Every week on the Sabbath the offering was made (46:4). The Sabbath means not only a new turn, but also that we are enjoying the Lord's work. To keep the Sabbath means that we stop our work and enjoy what the Lord has done. This is the principle of the Sabbath. This means that we are not trusting in our work, but we are fully trusting and enjoying the Lord's work. This is the meaning of keeping the Sabbath. We always need to renew this. We must be able to declare to the whole universe, "Our work has stopped and we are now enjoying the Lord's work!"</P><P>Furthermore, there was a daily offering (46:13). This daily offering was different from the daily offering required by Moses. Moses said that the continual burnt offering should be in the morning and in the evening. But in Ezekiel there is no offering in the evening. This means that in their serving, there is no evening; they are continually in the freshness of the morning. Praise the Lord! The situation in Ezekiel improved to the point that there was no more evening but only morning. There was no more sunset, but only sunrise.</P><P>In addition to the yearly offerings, the monthly offerings, the weekly offerings, and the daily offerings, there were also the offerings at the appointed feasts. The record tells us that they offered at the time of the Passover, at the time of Unleavened Bread, and at the time of the Feast of Tabernacles (45:21, 25). Hallelujah for all the offerings! Hallelujah for the Passover! Hallelujah for the tabernacle in fullness! Now we know what kind of priests we must be in order to serve the Lord, and now we know what we have to offer to the Lord. Christ is the real priest, and Christ is the real offering.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RIVER FLOWING OUT OF THE HOUSE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 47:1-12; Psa. 36:8; 46:4; Joel 3:18b; Zech. 14:8a</H1><P>Hallelujah for the river! Hallelujah for something flowing! Please notice that the flow is not in chapter one; in that chapter there was no flow, but there was the burning fire. There was no river, but there was the fire. Then in chapter thirty-seven there was the wind which became breath to us, but still there was no water flowing. The flowing of the water did not begin until chapter forty-seven. In chapter one the fire was burning, in chapter thirty-seven the wind was blowing and becoming breath, and finally in chapter forty-seven the water was flowing. The water could not come in before chapter forty-seven because the house had not been built up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FACTORS WHICH PRODUCED THE RIVER</H2><P>Several crucial factors brought in the flow of the river. First was the building up and completion of the house. Then the people began to have their living according to the house, according to its pattern, its laws, and its statutes. They began to live according to the house of God. Their daily walk, their daily life, and all their conduct was according to the form, fashion, pattern, statutes, and laws of the house (43:10-11). Next, there were the serving ones, the priests, serving the Lord in a proper way. Finally, there were all the adequate offerings: out of two hundred lambs, one was offered; out of the wheat and the barley, one-sixtieth was offered; and out of the oil, one-hundredth was offered. There were the yearly offerings, the monthly offerings, the weekly offerings, the daily offerings, and all the solemn feasts. How rich are all these items! We have to realize that the experience of all these items brought in the flow of the river. When the Lord saw all these things, He was so happy. He saw the house with all its forms and statutes, He saw the priests and the offerings, and He was very happy. Therefore, He sent the flowing of the river. The river began to flow out of the house. Wherever and whenever a group of believers are built up in oneness as Ezekiel described, the river will flow out of their building up. The river flows out of the building. The flow depends upon the building. If there is a building of the church in your place, the river will flow out. If there is a house where the Lord can say, "This is the place of my throne, and this is the place where I can put the soles of my feet, and this is the place where I can dwell, rest, and be satisfied" (43:7), be assured that the flow will come out. The flow comes out of the proper building.</P><P>Today in Christianity many zealous ones pay attention to outreach and to the gospel, yet their condition and their situation are very poor. They go out to work for the Lord, but no flow follows them. They have no flow because they neglect the source of the flow&#151;the building up of the church. There can be no flow apart from the building up. If there is a strong building up in the local churches, there will be a flowing river going out to other places. There will be the impact and the flooding. How much we need the building! We need the temple, the house of God, to be properly built up. Out of such a building, the flow of God will issue. Everything depends upon the building. The preaching of the gospel depends upon the building. The impact of the gospel upon the world depends upon the building. When the Christians are built up as one, the world will be convinced (John 17:23). The divided situation of Christianity greatly damages the impact of the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RIVER FLOWING TOWARD THE EAST</H2><P>The river issues forth from the house and flows toward the east (47:1). The east is the direction of the glory of the Lord (Num. 2:3; Ezek. 43:2). This indicates that the river of God will always flow in the direction of God's glory. The flow of the river does not care so much for you and for me, but it cares very much for God's glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RIVER FLOWING OUT AT THE RIGHT SIDE<br>OF THE TEMPLE</H2><P>The river does not flow out on the left side, but on the right side (47:1). According to the Bible, the right side is always the highest position. This signifies that the flow of the Lord must have the preeminence. We must give the flow of the Lord the highest position. We must give the Lord Himself the highest position. Then the flow will be prevailing. The flow should be the controlling factor in our person and in our work. The flow must have the place of preeminence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RIVER FLOWING BY THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR</H2><P>If there is no dealing of the cross, signified by the altar, the flow of the river will be frustrated. To have the flowing of the river, we need the dealing of the cross. The flowing is always at the side of the altar, meaning that the flow is always by the cross (47:1). If we are not willing to pass through the cross, we cannot expect that the flow will be prevailing within us. Let us willingly pass through the cross so that the flow will come forth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MAN WITH THE MEASURING REED</H2><P>The main point in this chapter is the man with the measuring reed in his hand (47:3). The man, who is the Lord Jesus Himself, has the appearance of brass (40:3). Brass or copper in typology signifies judgment and testing. The Lord Jesus as a man was tested and judged. Because He was tested and judged, He is today testing and judging. Because He was tested, He is qualified to test; because He was judged, He is qualified to judge. He is the One with the measuring reed in His hand, fully qualified to measure us. As we have pointed out previously, to measure means to test, to judge, and to possess. When a sister goes to the store to buy a piece of cloth, first she examines the piece of cloth and then she measures it. Whatever amount she measures, she also possesses. To measure means to examine, to test, to judge, and eventually to take over. This is very meaningful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MEASURING THE FLOW OF THE RIVER</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Measuring a Thousand Cubits</H2><P>The man came with a measuring reed in his hand to measure the flow of the river (47:3-5). When he first measured the river, there was only a trickle coming out from the house. He measured a thousand cubits and the flow became deeper, up to the ankle. He measured another thousand and the flow became deeper, up to the knee. When he measured yet another thousand cubits, the flow became deeper, up to the loins. When he measured the fourth time, the flow became a river which could not be passed over. The river became waters to swim in. The number one thousand in the Bible signifies a complete unit. For example, in Psalm 84 the Psalmist said that he would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God for one day than to stay with an evil person for a thousand days. Thus, one thousand means a complete unit. To measure one thousand means to measure a complete unit. It means a complete measuring. If we want to enjoy the flow out of the house, we must be measured completely. If we desire the flow out of the house to be deeper, we must be measured. Remember, to be measured by the Lord means to be tested, to be examined, to be judged, and eventually to be taken over by the Lord. We all must be judged. If we want to enjoy a deeper flow, we have to be judged. Our motives, our intentions, our aims, our goals, and our desires all must be judged. Everything we possess and everything we are involved in has to be judged. This will deepen the flow within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Thoroughly</H2><P>Confess thoroughly to the Lord. Let the Lord be your judge. Let Him bring you fully into His light and expose you. Tell Him, "Lord, all that You have judged is now Yours. You take over. You take full possession."</P><P>The Lord's judging and dealing with us is not once for all. In this account, the man measured not only once, or twice, or even three times, but four times. Four is the number of the creature, and this means as a creature we must be thoroughly judged and tested by the Lord. We have to be fully taken over by the Lord. To be completely taken over by the Lord is not easy to experience. We may think that we have been fully taken over by the Lord, but eventually after two weeks we will realize that we still have some reservation. At that time we need to be tested and judged again. We need to consecrate again and tell the Lord, "Lord take it. Possess it." We may think the Lord has taken over everything. But the Lord knows He has only gained us to a certain extent. A few months later, we may realize again how much we have reserved and preserved for ourselves. Once more we confess and experience the Lord's judging and testing. How much we still need to let the Lord measure, test, judge, and possess us!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Flow Vindicating</H2><P>How can we determine how much we have been measured and possessed by the Lord? We can know by how deep the river is. If the river is only up to our ankles or up to our knees, it proves we have not been measured fully by the Lord. How deep the river is depends on how much we have been measured by the Lord. There is no need for you to argue with me and try to justify yourself. Simply check the depth of your flow. Look at your flow within. Is the flow within you up to the ankle? or up to the knee? or up to the loin? or has it become a river that you cannot pass over?</P><P>The same principle applies to the local churches. There is no need to argue concerning your local church. You may think that your local church is the best. But simply check the flow. How deep is the flow? You may say that you have a flow, but how deep is the flow? Is the flow in your church only to the ankle? or is it to the knee? or is it to the loin? or has it become a river? The flow in your local church depends upon the degree of the Lord's measuring and possessing. We may fool one another, but we can never fool the Lord. He knows the depth of the flow where we are. The depth of the flow depends on how much we have been measured and taken over by the Lord. For His measuring, the Lord needs our cooperation. The Lord can never judge us, measure us, possess us, and take us over without our adequate cooperation. We look to the Lord for His mercy that in all the local churches there will be a river that no man can pass over.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FLOW RESTRICTING OUR NATURAL MAN</H2><P>The most convenient way to walk is on dry land where there is no water. When the flow of the river comes, it is wonderful, but it is not convenient. When the water is up to your ankles you can still walk, but it is not very convenient. When the water rises up to your knees, it is even more difficult to walk. When the water comes up to your loins, it becomes very difficult to walk. Before you enjoy the grace of the Lord as the flow, you are able to do whatever you like. It is very convenient for you to walk. When you experience the Lord's flow only in a shallow way, you can still walk by your own effort. But as the flow becomes deeper, your walk becomes more difficult. You have the grace, and yet the grace is not sufficient. You must still exercise your own effort. As the flow increases, it bothers, restricts, and frustrates you. When the flow of grace rises higher to the loins, it is more difficult to move. This is the hardest time to be a Christian. You have sufficient grace so that it is not easy to lose your temper, and yet you do not have sufficient grace to overcome your temper. This is a real dilemma. Neither way is easy. The grace is there, yet it is not deep enough. Once the water of life becomes so deep that it is a river you cannot pass over, then you will shout, "Hallelujah!" Then you will swim in the river. When you swim, you give up standing on your own feet. To swim means you are not standing on your own two feet; you give up your standing. I am afraid that many of you have not given up your standing. You are standing on your own two feet. You are still struggling on your own standing. You are standing on your two feet exercising your own efforts to become an overcomer. You need more grace; you need a deeper flow so that you will give up your standing and swim in the river. The best way to swim in this river is to put your trust in the water and forget about your own efforts. Let the water float you. Hallelujah, this is wonderful! This is sufficient grace, but you must go along with the flow. When you are being supported by the river, you should not have your own direction. You must forsake your own direction and go in the direction of the flow. Many times the flow is toward the east, but your intention is toward the west. Because we human beings are not simple, the Lord always has some problems with us. But hallelujah, we do have the flow! Hallelujah, we do have the river!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RIVER CAUSING EVERYTHING TO LIVE</H2><P>Where the river flows, everything shall live and be full of life. This river is the river of life, and only life can cause things to live. Mere teaching or gifts cannot impart life. Ezekiel does not say that everything shall be known or that everything shall speak in tongues or that everything shall exercise gifts, but that everything shall live (47:9). In this flow the trees live and bear sweet, delicious fruit every month (47:12). Furthermore, the water brings forth an abundance of fish (47:9). The cattle are included within the names of two cities, Engedi and Eneglaim (47:10). Engedi means the fountain of kids or lambs, and Eneglaim means the fountain of two calves. These are the fountains for the young cattle, the kids, and the calves. Thus, the flow of the river produces trees, fish, and cattle. In the proper church life, there should be many trees bearing good fruit as food. There should be no lack of fruit. All the trees grow by the living water. If the church in your place is living, there should be trees bearing fruit. When there are trees bearing fruit, it indicates that there is a flow in your church.</P><P>By the flowing of the river there is also fishing (47:10). Fishing signifies increase in numbers. If the number of people in your local church does not increase year after year, it means you have no fishing, and no fishing means there is no flow. We need the flow for the fishing. We need a place to cast out the net and a place to spread the net. We need fishing to have an increase in number.</P><P>In the local churches we also need some fountains of kids and fountains of calves for feeding. We must have not only fishing, but also feeding. Thus, we need food, we need increase in number, and we also need feeding. This will bring in the mingling and the building up of the church. Hallelujah! We need Engedi, and we need Eneglaim, the fountains of the kids and the calves. All these items depend upon the flow of the river. We all need such a flow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RIVER FLOWING TOWARD THE EAST SEA</H2><P>According to the map the East Sea is the Salt Sea or the Dead Sea (47:8). By the flowing of the river out of the house, the salt water of the Dead Sea will be healed. This means that death will be swallowed by life. Life will swallow up death. Where there is the rich and deep flow of life in a local church, much death is swallowed up. If there is no flow in a church, that church becomes a dead sea full of salt. By the flow of the river, deadness can be swallowed up by life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RIVER BEING UNABLE TO HEAL THE MARSHES</H2><P>The Dead Sea and the dry places can be made alive, but the marshes cannot be healed (47:11). A marsh is a place that is neither dry nor flowing with water. It is half mud and half water&#151;neither dry nor wet. A marsh indicates a situation full of compromise. When we are in a compromising situation, we are in a marsh. Never try to help a marshy situation. The Lord Jesus told the church at Laodicea to be either hot or cold. If they remained lukewarm, the Lord would spew them out of His mouth (Rev. 3:15-16). To be lukewarm is to be in a marsh.</P><P>If you stand in a denomination, stand absolutely. If you stand as a free group, stand absolutely. If you stand on the ground of the church, stand absolutely. Otherwise, you are in a marsh. If you give up the denominations, yet you are not absolute for the proper ground of the church, you are in a marsh. You may also be in the local church life and not be absolute. That is a marsh. Even the Lord cannot heal a marsh. A marsh is a neutral, halfway place, full of compromise. Some saints are halfway between Babylon and Jerusalem. This means they are a marsh. We need to be absolutely in the flow or stay on the dry ground. If we stay in a marshy situation, the Lord can do nothing. Do not remain in a muddy, marshy situation. To walk or move in a muddy, marshy situation is very difficult. To get into a marsh is very easy, but to get out of a marsh is very difficult. We must be absolute for the church life. The church life must be a place of absoluteness.</P><P>The church life must likewise be a place after its kind. Genesis 1:11-12 says that the grass, the trees, and the herbs brought forth each after its kind. An apple tree cannot bring forth an apple-peach. To bring forth an apple-peach is a marsh. That is not after its kind. If you are a man, simply be a man. If you are a woman, simply be a woman. You cannot be a man-woman. If you are in the denominations, be in the denominations. If you are a free group, be a free group after its kind. If you are the church, just be the church after its kind. If you are in the Lord's recovery, come back all the way to Jerusalem. Do not come halfway. If you come halfway, you become a marsh, and you will have no flow, not even a trickle. You will have just enough water to make you muddy. The marsh cannot be healed. I have never seen a marsh that was healed. In Revelation 22:11 the Lord said, "He who does unrighteousness, let him still do unrighteousness; and he who is filthy, let him still be made filthy; and he who is righteous, let him still do righteousness; and he who is holy, let him still be made holy." The Lord desires and requires absoluteness. Learn to be absolute. By being absolute you will be in the flow, and the flow will not be a trickle, but a river to swim in. Everything shall live where the river flows. Hallelujah! In the local churches the river flows! Hallelujah! The river is here!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE HOLY LAND AND THE HOLY CITY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 45:1-8; 47:13-20; 48:1-35; Rev. 21:12, 13</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LAND</H2><P>At the end of the book of Ezekiel there are two things: the holy land and the holy city. We need to see something more concerning the holy land. Apart from the land, there could be no temple. Although we may appreciate the temple very much, we have to realize that the temple is in the land, and without the land there could not be a temple. The temple depends upon the land. The temple typifies the church, and the land typifies Christ. Without the experience of Christ, there is no possibility for us to have the church. The church is the issue of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A History of the Land</H2><P>Because the land, typifying Christ, is so crucial, we need to look at it once more. The land is first mentioned in Genesis 1. On the third day of the Lord's recovery of His creation, the land was recovered. The land emerged from the waters of death. Until that time all the land was under the death waters. But on the third day the Lord caused the land to rise up out of the death waters. The land in Genesis 1 typifies Christ. Christ was resurrected from the dead on the third day as the all-inclusive land. Every kind of life, whether vegetable, animal, or human, came out of that land. Apart from that land, no life can exist. All of the living things came into being out of the land. Because the land signifies Christ, it means that all the living things come out of Christ. Christ is the good land which God prepared for man.</P><P>However, man fell and became degraded, causing God to judge the earth again. During the time of Noah, the land was flooded and once more was covered by the death waters (Gen. 7:19). This means that the human race lost the land. Once again, however, the Lord brought the land out of the death waters, and the family of Noah was given the right to enjoy the land. But the descendants of Noah fell and gathered at Babel to build a tower of rebellion against God (Gen. 11). From Babel God scattered the people and called out Abraham from that fallen place and brought him into Canaan, the good land (Gen. 12). At that time God promised Abraham that the land of Canaan would belong to him and to his children. However, the descendants of Abraham also fell. Human history is a record of man's fall. They fell from the good land into Egypt. The whole house of Jacob went down into Egypt and again they lost the good land. But four hundred years later, by God's deliverance, they experienced the Passover and, passing through the Red Sea, they left Egypt (Exo. 12). After forty years of wandering in the wilderness, they passed through the Jordan into the good land. There they fought against all the inhabitants and recovered their lost land. Upon that recovered land, they built the temple, and God's glory descended and filled the temple (2 Chron. 5:14). Later, though, due to their falling away and their degradation, they were carried away from the land again. They lost the land once more.</P><P>In the midst of the captivity, Ezekiel was brought back to the land by the Spirit (8:3). Ezekiel went back by the Spirit to see the land. Many times in Ezekiel, the Lord promised that He would bring His people back to their land (Ezek. 11, 33, 34, 36 and 37). He promised to bring them back even to the top of the mountains of Israel (34:14). This indicated a real recovery of the land. Before the building can be recovered, the land must be recovered. The recovery of the land signifies the recovery of the enjoyment of Christ. Although Christ Himself can never be lost, Christ in our experience can be lost. At the time we were saved we received Christ, but not long afterward we fell away and lost Christ in our experience. The recovery of the land is the recovery of the experiences of the riches of Christ. Hallelujah! The land was recovered! Then the house was built on the land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Land of Milk and Honey</H2><P>The land, with all its riches, is called a land flowing with milk and honey (20:6). Both milk and honey are the product of two lives working together. It takes both the vegetable life and the animal life to produce milk and honey. To produce milk you need cattle, the animal life, and you also need pasture, the vegetable life. Thus, milk is the product of two kinds of lives working together. It is the same with honey. Honey is produced by a little animal. But bees need the flowers of many kinds of plants. Therefore, both milk and honey are the product of two kinds of lives.</P><P>Christ as our good land has two kinds of lives. He has the vegetable life, and He has the animal life. In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus says that He is the grain of wheat (John 12:24). This is the vegetable life. The same Gospel also says that He is the Lamb of God (John 1:29). This is the animal life. On the one hand Christ is the wheat, the vegetable life; and on the other hand Christ is the Lamb, the animal life. The animal life is for being slain and shedding the blood for redemption, and the vegetable life is for producing and generating life. One grain of wheat falls into the ground, dies, grows up, and multiplies into many grains. Thus, the animal life is primarily for redemption, while the vegetable life is primarily for generating life. Out of these two lives mingled together we have the riches of Christ, the milk and the honey, for our enjoyment. To help you realize and enjoy the riches of Christ as the good land, I encourage you to read the book, The All-Inclusive Christ. By reading that book, you will discover that the all-inclusive Christ is unsearchably rich. He is our good land for us to live in and walk in and build the temple in.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Borders of the Land</H2><P>Ezekiel presents the borders of the good land in a peculiar and yet wonderful way. He says that the border on the west is the Great Sea (47:20). This means the coast of the Mediterranean Sea is the western border. He says that on the east side there is also a sea (47:18). But the sea on the east is not a great sea, rather it is the Dead Sea. At the top of the Dead Sea is the River Jordan which goes northward to another sea, the Sea of Galilee or the Sea of Tiberias. The position of the good land between these two waters is very meaningful. The good land of Canaan is between the waters of the Great Sea on the west and the waters of the Dead Sea with the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee on the east. The land is surrounded by water, which signifies death. In the Dead Sea there is nothing but death. In the Great Sea there is salt water which also signifies death. Furthermore, the River Jordan in typology signifies death. Thus, the good land is surrounded by death and yet not overflooded by death. The good land coming up out of death typifies the resurrected Christ. Some of the verses in the Bible imply that the good land of Canaan is an elevated land; it is a raised-up land. Christ was raised from the dead; He was elevated from the dead. The good land is not a low land, but a high land. The Dead Sea is hundreds of feet below sea level, but Mount Zion is hundreds of feet above sea level. This shows that the land of Canaan is really an elevated land. This is the resurrected Christ. Another river, the river of Egypt, is the border of the good land on the south (47:19). The good land has water for its border on three sides. This signifies that the land is the resurrected Christ. On the north side, there is no river as a border, but there is Mount Hermon. Mount Hermon signifies the heavens. According to Psalm 133, the dew comes down from Mount Hermon and descends upon the mountains of Zion. This signifies that the grace comes down from the heavens and descends upon all the local churches. The elevated land with Mount Hermon signifies the resurrected Christ joined to the heavens. There is not only the resurrection, but also the ascension. He is not only the resurrected Christ, but also the ascended Christ. He is above all the death waters, and He is joined to the high mountain, Mount Hermon. He is resurrected, and He is ascended. These are the borders of the good land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Subdivisions of the Good Land</H2><P>Seven of the tribes of Israel were in the north and five were in the south. Of all the twelve tribes, Judah and Benjamin were the most dear to the Lord. When the tribes became divided, only Judah and Benjamin remained with the Lord and never participated in division. For this reason they were located near to the Lord and were very dear to Him. Because of Gad's poor condition, he was placed in the extreme southern portion of the land. You can have confidence in the Lord's judgment and estimation concerning you. Men may make mistakes about you, but the Lord will never make any mistake about you. The Lord is altogether fair. He knows exactly where He must put you. He knows whether to put you in the north or in the south. The Lord can never be wrong. In the migrations of the local churches, you may not know where to go, but the Lord knows where to put you. No matter how much consideration you give to migration, eventually you will be in a certain place under the Lord's sovereignty. The Lord knows whether you are Dan or Benjamin or Judah or Gad. He can never be wrong, and He is sovereign. Never blame anyone else. You must realize that God is sovereign. Dan was never satisfied with where he was placed. In Revelation 7 the name of Dan is not mentioned in the list of the tribes of Israel because of their idolatry and degradation (Judges 18). The Lord temporarily cut off his name from the list of the tribes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Holy Portion</H2><P>According to Ezekiel the whole land of Canaan was divided into three portions: the northern portion was for seven tribes (48:1-8), the southern portion was for five tribes (48:23-27), and the middle portion was an offering to God. Because the Lord gave the people of Israel the whole land of Canaan as their possession, He asked them to heave the middle part back to Him as an offering. The middle portion of the land was a heave offering, heaved up by the people to God (48:8-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Middle Portion</H2><P>In the middle portion there was a square 25,000 reeds long and 25,000 reeds wide. One reed equals six cubits. The 25,000 reeds indicates the number of responsibility, five, multiplied by 5,000. What a great amount of responsibility this indicates! This square is called the holy heave offering and is divided into three strips. The middle strip is 25,000 reeds long from east to west and 10,000 reeds broad from north to south. This is the part for the temple. This is also the part given to the priests, especially to the sons of Zadok, because of their faithfulness (48:11). This middle part became their inheritance. Within their inheritance was the lot for the temple. This means that the priests, the sons of Zadok, were the Israelites who were the closest to the Lord. The Lord even lived on their portion, their lot. Their inheritance, their lot, was the Lord's dwelling place because they were very close to Him.</P><P>The second part, on the south, was also 25,000 reeds long by 10,000 reeds broad. This part belonged to the Levites who ministered to the house, to the people, and who helped in all the business of the service with the offerings. The Levites were close to the Lord, but not as close as the priests (48:13).</P><P>The third portion, on the north side, measured 25,000 reeds by 5,000 reeds, and was for the city (48:15). The city was in the middle part of this northern portion. The remainder of this portion belonged to the laborers, the workers in the city. Thus, the holy heave offering land was divided into three parts: one part for the priests, another part for the Levites, and the third part for the city with all of its workers. According to the map, besides this holy heave offering land, there was still some remainder of land on the west and on the east. These two pieces of land as a residue were assigned and allotted to the king, to the royal family (48:21).</P><P>The allotment of the land and the placement of the tribes upon their particular portion of land is very meaningful. First, this picture shows us that they all enjoyed Christ. From Dan in the north to Gad in the south all the Israelites enjoyed Christ, but their nearness to Christ was not the same. The closest ones to Christ were the priests, the faithful sons of Zadok. Next to them were the Levites and those who worked in the city. Next to these were the royal family. Each tribe enjoyed Christ, but their distance from Christ varied. One tribe was very close to Christ and another was not close to Christ, yet both were enjoying Christ.</P><P>The distance of the tribes from Christ determined their importance. The most important people were the priests who were closest to Christ. They maintained the fellowship between the Israelites and the Lord. The fellowship was maintained by the closest ones. The Levites were next in nearness to the Lord, and they maintained a service unto the Lord. Service to the Lord is good, but it is not as good as fellowship. Their service was not as dear and precious as fellowship. Then the workers for the city were the third closest to the Lord. They maintained a work for the city. Thus, there was the fellowship, the service, and the work for the city.</P><P>The city is the symbol of the divine government, so there was a work to maintain God's government. Besides this, there was the royal family with the king and the kingship. According to Ezekiel's record, the temple was not within the city, but was separated from the city. The temple signifies the fellowship of God, and the city signifies the government of God. The temple is the house, and the city is the kingdom. The temple is God's house, God's dwelling place, for His rest, and the city is God's kingdom for His authority.</P><P>It is very important to realize that all these things&#151;the fellowship of the priests, the service of the Levites, the work to maintain God's government, and the kingship&#151;come out of the riches of the good land. This means that all the fellowship, service, work, government, royalty, lordship, and kingship come out of our enjoyment of the riches of Christ. The more we enjoy Christ, the closer we are to Him. The closer we are to Him, the more important we are in His purpose. We may be like Dan or Gad, far away from His presence, yet still enjoying some of His riches. But we are not that crucial to His economy because of our great distance from the Lord. Look at the priests. They are extremely crucial. Their lot, their portion, is the Lord's dwelling place. We all must desire to be there. Do not be concerned about who will be in the place of Dan. Let the Lord take care of that. You must aspire and exercise to be a priest. Revelation 1:6 says that Christ has made us all kings and priests unto God and His Father. As kings and priests we have been predestined to be very close to the Lord. We should not be content to be like Dan, far away at the northern extreme of the land. We must be the priests and the kings who are very close to the Lord. We all must be the sons of Zadok.</P><P>Revelation 20:6 says that we will be kings and priests for eternity. We will enjoy the milk and the honey&#151;all the riches of Christ. Today we need to learn to enjoy Christ. Do not care that much for teachings and gifts. Care for the riches of Christ. I am bold to tell you this because I have the solid gold in my hands. What you have in your hands is at best copper. I will never exchange my gold for your copper. Sooner or later you will be convinced to drop your copper and pick up my gold. If you will not do it today, you will do it tomorrow. If you will not drop your copper in this age, surely you will drop it in the coming age. If not in the coming age, you will drop it in eternity. We have not been predestined to teachings or gifts. We have been predestined to the enjoyment of Christ. Learn to enjoy the riches of Christ as the good land. Day by day enjoy Him by eating, drinking, and breathing Him. This is the way for us to go on. Praise the Lord!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CITY</H2><P>Both Ezekiel and Revelation end with a city, Jerusalem. Only one city in the whole Bible has twelve gates with twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and that is the city of Jerusalem. We must apply the things mentioned in Ezekiel to ourselves because eventually we will be that city. We should not regard all the words of Ezekiel as merely a prophecy. It does contain prophecies, but primarily we must apply the record to ourselves. Do not apply the points in Ezekiel merely to the future, but also to the present.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</H2><P>With this city there is the number twelve which is composed, not of six times two, but of three times four. It is three times four because there are three gates on four sides making a total of twelve gates. Please remember that four is the number of the creature and three is the number of the Triune God. Twelve signifies the mingling of the Triune God with the creatures.</P><P> This city eventually is not only a mingling, but also a perfect government with a complete administration. Twelve in the Bible also indicates a perfect government and administration in completion. It is not just a mingling of divinity with humanity, but also a perfect government which comes out of this mingling. Thus, it is a city. As a city it is a government which exercises full authority for God's complete administration. God's government and God's administration come from the mingling of God with His creatures. This mingling is for eternity.</P><P>The church must be like this. The church must be just the mingling of God with man. Out of such a mingling there will be the church government for God's administration on the earth and for the whole universe. All this is very meaningful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CAUSING ALL WHO ENTER TO BE ONE</H2><P>The city has four sides with three gates on each side. This indicates that no matter from which side we enter the city, we will be in the same city. No matter which gate we enter, we all will be one. In that city we can never be divided. We are one because we are in one city. The New Jerusalem has only one street. Regardless of which direction you come from, and regardless of which gate you enter through, you will be on the same street. On that same street there is the one flow, the one river, with the one drink and the one tree of life. All are the same, all are one. There is one city, one street, one river, one flow, one drink, one tree of life. We all have to be impressed&#151;one! one! one! we all are one!</P></body></html>
