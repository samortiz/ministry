   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God Making Christ Sin on Our Behalf</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sin came from Satan as the rebel against God Isa 14:12-15 , entered into man Rom 5:12 , and made man not only a sinner, but sin itself under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, when Christ became a man in flesh John 1:14 , He was made sin not sinful on our behalf to be judged by God Rom 8:3 that we might become God s righteousness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to understand what it means to say that God made Christ sin on our behalf, we need to read John 1:14 and Romans 8:3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 1:14 says that the Word, which is God Himself, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Flesh refers to fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christ became a man, man had already fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This fallen man is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, when Christ became man, He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we put John 1:14 together with 2 Corinthians 5:21, we see that when Christ became flesh, He was made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the sight of God we, as fallen flesh, are actually sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are not only sinful and are not only sinners we are sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Christ became flesh, in this sense He was made sin on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 8:3 says, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yes, Christ was made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in this verse we are told that He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that He was made in the form of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what is signified by the type of the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the children of Israel were bitten by serpents, they received the poisonous nature of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the sight of God, they all became serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, God told Moses to hang a bronze serpent on a pole.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This bronze serpent is a type of Christ dying on the cross as our substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As John 3:14 clearly indicates, this serpent on the pole was a type of Christ lifted up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As that serpent was lifted up in the wilderness, so Christ was lifted up on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, as the bronze serpent had the form but not the poisonous nature of a serpent, so Christ had the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin, but He did not actually have the nature of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had the form of the serpent, but He did not have the serpentine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For us to experience the first step of reconciliation, it was necessary for Christ to die for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Corinthians 15:3 Paul declares, Christ died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in order for us to be reconciled further, even fully, to God, it was necessary for Christ to die also for us, not only for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For Christ to die for our sins is one thing, but for Him to die for us is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ died for our sins so that our sins may be forgiven by God and taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ also died for us so that we may be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ s dying for our sins accomplishes the first step of reconciliation, and His dying for us accomplishes the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul has this second step in mind when he says, One died on behalf of all 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to this verse, Christ died not for sins; He died for persons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The objective aspect of Christ s death involves His dying for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the subjective aspect of Christ s death involves His dying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This subjective aspect enables the believers to be reconciled to God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, in the objective aspect of His death Christ bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, in the subjective aspect He became sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today there is much teaching among Christians about Christ dying for our sins and bearing our sins, but not much is said about Christ being made sin on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since we, as fallen human beings, are sin, for Christ to be made sin actually means for Him to become us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The subjective aspect of the death of Christ puts us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Romans 8:3, God condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that He condemned us; He condemned the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, the veil, the natural man, the natural life, the flesh, was cleft through the subjective aspect of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When sin was condemned and when the veil was rent, we were terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, the second veil was taken away and we may be fully reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we should not remain in the Holy Place; we should come forward into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, we should no longer know one another according to flesh, but we should know one another according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul s concept in this chapter is to show us that the apostles, as ministers of the new covenant, are those who can spontaneously bring others back to God fully and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I would ask you to compare the situation of the new covenant ministers with that among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some are brought back to God only in name.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The situation of others is better.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They have been brought back to God in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The genuine, saved, blood-washed, and Spirit-regenerated Christians have all been brought into the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, many still live in the flesh, in the natural life, and some still live in gross sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who are in the outer court can bring others into the outer court, no further.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Likewise, the genuine Christians who are in the Holy Place have been brought there by some who were already in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They have been reconciled to God to this extent, but not to the full extent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How far can you bring another person?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How close can you bring others to God?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It depends on how much you have been reconciled to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who have been brought to God by you cannot advance further than you have advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you have entered the Holy Place, you can bring others there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you are at the entrance of the Holy Place, you can bring others to the entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if you are in the center of the Holy Place, you can bring others there.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The point here is that we can bring others only as far as we ourselves have gone.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is Paul s thought in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Here Paul seems to be saying, We apostles have been brought into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God has reconciled us to Himself fully and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, spontaneously He gives us a commission to reconcile others to God fully and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because we have been reconciled to Him to this extent, we can help others to be reconciled to the same extent.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The ministers of the new covenant have been reconciled to God to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All the veils are gone, and there is nothing between them and God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They have been reconciled to God completely and also thoroughly constituted of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They behave according to their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They live a crucified life for the manifestation of the truth and the shining of the gospel, and they are mature, ripe, and ready to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Their only aim, their only ambition, is to please the Lord by living to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>These are the ones who can bring others back to God thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Because they are in the Holy of Holies, they can bring others there also.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Becoming the Righteousness of God in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Eventually, those who have been brought back to God in the Holy of Holies will enjoy Christ to the uttermost and even become the righteousness of God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Paul speaks of this in 5:21 where he says, That we might become God s righteousness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Righteousness issues from God for His administration Psa 89:14; 97:2; Isa 32:1 , which is Christ to be our righteousness Phil 3:9; 1 Cor 1:30 , making us God s righteousness in Him, not merely righteous before God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Through His redemption, man as a sinner, even as sin, is made God s righteousness, reconciled to the righteous God, and a new creation living to Him for God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The apostles are commissioned to minister such a Christ, with all the glorious issues of His marvelous achievement, to His believers who are His members to form His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Praise and glory be to Him forever!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The phrase in Him means in union with Christ, not only positionally, but organically in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We were enemies of God Col 1:21 by becoming sin, which came from the one who rebelled against God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Christ was made sin for us by becoming one with us through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God condemned Him in flesh as sin for us, through His death, that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>By this righteousness, we, the enemies of God, could be and have been reconciled to God 2 Cor 5:18-20; Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the organic union with Christ, those who have been brought thoroughly back to God are made the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They not only become righteous; they are the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This means that they not only become righteous persons, but they become righteousness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God desires to have a people on earth who are not only righteous persons; He wants a people who, in the sight of God, the Devil, the angels, and the demons, are the very righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>To be made righteous before God is one thing; to be God s righteousness is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To become the righteousness of God is the highest enjoyment of the Triune God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In Adam we fell so low that we became sin.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Not only were we sinful before God we became sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But now in Christ, having been brought thoroughly back to God, we may enjoy Christ to such an extent that in Him we become God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>What a salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>What a reconciliation!</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>To have this enjoyment is to be on the peak of God s salvation, to be on the peak of our holy Zion.</S>
