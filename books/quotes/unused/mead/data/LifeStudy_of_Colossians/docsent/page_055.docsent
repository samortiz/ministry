   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE ROOTED IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:7 Paul speaks of having been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be rooted in Him is for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse Paul views the believers as plants who have been rooted in Christ as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, many Christians have not been rooted in Christ adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have been rooted in Christ properly, there will be no need to talk much about the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ground of the church is oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the base of this oneness is the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father, as mentioned by Paul in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we have been truly rooted in Christ, in our experience He will be the base of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some Seventh-Day Adventists consider the keeping of the Sabbath another testimony on earth in addition to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a statement indicates a lack of being rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have been rooted in Him deeply and properly, we would never say that God has set up another testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s unique testimony is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have been rooted in Him, nothing will be able to distract us from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all should be able to say, Lord Jesus, I thank You that I have been rooted in You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have no standing apart from You.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Lord s recovery we can testify that our ground is Christ and Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we consider the situation of today s Christianity, we shall see that the various denominations and independent groups have something other than Christ as their ground.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Seventh-Day Adventists have as their ground the keeping of the seventh day, whereas the ground of the Baptist denomination is baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some denominations, such as the Church of Christ, go so far as to insist that only in their water can a believer be baptized properly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although some groups insist on baptism by immersion, others oppose it; they claim that baptism is strictly spiritual and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1964 I met a man who argued strongly against baptism in water.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He insisted that the baptism spoken of in Romans 6 refers to baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He interpreted every New Testament reference to baptism after John the Baptist as baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He even became quite angry when his position was challenged according to certain verses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A few days later as I was ministering in a certain place, I was challenged by a woman from the Church of Christ concerning water baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just a few days prior, a man argued with me about baptism in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now a woman boldly asked about water baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither this man nor this woman had been adequately rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This illustrates the shameful fact that Christians are divided because they take as their ground something other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul realized the importance of being rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He knew that it was a serious matter to be transplanted from Christ and to be rooted in something else, such as heathen philosophy or Jewish ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wanted the Colossians to see that philosophy was not the soil in which they had been rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They had been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is our unique soil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>TO BE BUILT UP IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Having been rooted in Christ, we now are being built up in Him 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be built up is for the building of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we have been rooted, we are still in the process of being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a corporate matter as well as a personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A building is not composed merely of one item, but of many items that have been fitted together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to be rooted in Christ and also built up in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul was concerned lest the Colossians be distracted from Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They had been rooted in Christ, but they still had to go on to be built up in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to be built up corporately, the Colossians had to forsake the Judaistic observances and the heathen ordinances and philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Otherwise, they would have been transplanted from Christ and rooted in something else.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, they would have been led astray from the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we take in some kind of philosophy, ordinance, observance, or practice in place of Christ, the church life is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are divided from those believers who have different opinions concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who are preoccupied with such things will eventually cease to care about the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In principle, this is what happened to some saints among us who were influenced by certain concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a result of this influence, they lost their heart for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was no longer possible for them to be built up in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How crucial it is to be rooted in Christ and to be built up in Christ and in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this way we experience Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
