<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Matt. 1:20 ...That which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 15:45 ...The last Adam <em>became</em> a life-giving Spirit.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2">In the New Testament</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>[Because there are a number of titles for the Spirit in the New Testament, we shall only be able to cover twelve of them for our purpose here.] In the New Testament <em>the Holy Spirit</em> is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God.<sup>79</sup> This divine title is first used when God came in to prepare a forerunner of the Lord Jesus (Luke 1:15) and a human body for Christ (v. 35). This indicates that the Holy Spirit is related to the incarnation of God.</p>
<p>Spirit denotes the nature of God, the nature of God&rsquo;s person, and holy denotes an attribute of God&rsquo;s nature. God&rsquo;s nature is holy. Incarnation is a matter of bringing God&rsquo;s nature into man. God desires to make His chosen people holy in the divine nature so that they may be holy even as He is holy [Lev. 19:2; 1 Pet. 1:16].</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in God&rsquo;s incarnation makes man distinct from being common as God is distinct in His holy nature.... The Holy Spirit, of whom the holy Jesus (Acts 3:14) was conceived and born as mentioned in Matthew 1:18 and 20, will make the believers of the holy Jesus intrinsically holy as He is holy in the divine nature. Eventually, all these believers will consummate in the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2).<sup>80</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of the Son of God</h2>
<p>Galatians 4:6 says, &ldquo;Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&rdquo;...God the Father sent forth God the Son to redeem us from the law that we might receive sonship (Gal. 4:4-5). He also sends forth God the Spirit to impart His life into us that we may become His sons in reality....Once we have been born of the Spirit, we need the Spirit in order to grow in life. Without the Spirit we cannot have the position, right, or privilege of sonship....But when the Spirit comes, the sonship is made real. The Spirit of the Son of God, therefore, is the reality of sonship.<sup>81</sup> Although the Spirit of sonship has come into our spirit, the Spirit cries in our hearts, Abba, Father. This indicates that our relationship with our Father in the sonship is sweet and very intimate....How tender and sweet it is to call God, Abba, Father! Such an intimate calling involves our emotion as well as our spirit....This proves that we have a genuine, bona fide relationship in life with our Father. We are His real sons.<sup>82</sup></p>
<p>The Life-giving Spirit</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45...tells us that the last Adam, who was Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit. The Redeemer, the Savior, who passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, became a life-giving Spirit.<sup>83</sup> Christ&rsquo;s being the last Adam means that after Him there is no more Adam. In Christ, Adam was ended.<sup>84</sup>The title &ldquo;the life-giving Spirit&rdquo; indicates that the Spirit is moving, working, and living in us to impart life into us....The Spirit is the life-imparting Spirit, working to give life to our whole being.<sup>85</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>The term &ldquo;the Spirit of life&rdquo; is used only once in the New Testament&mdash;in Romans 8:2. The Spirit is not only the life-giving Spirit but also the Spirit of life. The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life. Actually, the Spirit Himself is life. Therefore, with the Spirit of life we have the riches of the divine life.</p>
<p>The way to have life is the Spirit. Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. These two are actually one.... Thus, the way to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is the Spirit of life.<sup>86</sup></p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
