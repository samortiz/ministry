   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUFFERING WITH THE LORD TODAY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REIGNING WITH HIM ON THAT DAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Samuel says that David was the anointed king 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jonathan was a good friend of David; the two of them were one in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If Jonathan had followed David, he could have become the chief minister.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet he returned to Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>David was in the forest, yet Jonathan was in the palace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He returned to the palace too soon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If he had followed David, how wonderful the palace would have been to him later!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we are afraid of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord will surely be the King on earth one day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The question is whether or not you are willing to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BEING CRUCIFIED WITH THE LORD AND</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BEARING THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Witness Lee: When Satan's rebellious life and nature entered into man's flesh, man's flesh became Satan's armor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God sent Christ to come and put on the human flesh also.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord dealt with Satan through putting on the human flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Within man's flesh, there is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every fleshly person has Satan working within him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, as long as man is in the flesh, he offends God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The most wonderful thing today is that, although Satan entered into man's flesh, Christ also put on the human flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, Christ did not have any of the satanic nature in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Chinese have a saying: "One has to venture into the tiger's den before he can catch the cub."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is like a situation where a robber has climbed into a house, and the policeman has to go inside the house to catch the robber.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 2:14 says that Christ through death destroyed the one who has the might of death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His flesh, Christ destroyed the dwelling of Satan through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why the cross of Christ stripped Satan naked.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today in order for us to oppose Satan, we have to remain on the ground of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not stand on the ground of the cross, Satan will be able to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we remain on the ground of the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are two things concerning the cross that are quite important to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first is that we are crucified with the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second is that we have to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being Crucified with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have been crucified with Christ Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to see that not only has the Lord died for us; we have died with Him also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why do we have to die?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is because we have already been condemned to death; we do not deserve to live on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Bearing the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Remaining on the Ground of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To bear the cross means that we remain on the ground of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Baptism signifies our crucifixion with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, after baptism, have we walked away from the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever we walk away from the cross, we are setting the cross aside, and we are not abiding in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The distinctiveness of Christ's salvation lies in the death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The distinctiveness of our experience of salvation lies also in the death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Death is the way of the Christian salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only do we testify on the day of baptism that we are dead; we have to allow the death of the cross to continually work in us moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, we were crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the other hand, we bear the cross, and the cross becomes the place in which we remain.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To bear the cross does not mean to wear a golden cross or a wooden cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To bear the cross means that we remain in the cross, and we continue to stand on the ground of the cross.</S>
