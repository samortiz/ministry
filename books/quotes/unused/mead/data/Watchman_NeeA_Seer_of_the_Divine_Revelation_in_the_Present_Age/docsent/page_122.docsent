   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we published our first issue of The Christian, we included a statement stating our goal, standard, and affiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We would now like to reprint what we said then:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOAL: In this little monthly publication, our desire is to supply spiritual milk to the young believers and solid food to the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We especially stress the salvation of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we are even more concerned with the spiritual condition of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We ask God to strengthen us that we could preach all of God's will.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not afraid to preach the pure Word of the Bible, even if men oppose; but if it is not the Word of the Bible, we could never agree even if everyone approved....</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a certain pastor who regularly reads the gospel messages of this paper to his congregation on Sundays.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He feels that even though they cannot hear our preaching personally, he still can use this direct method to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord has greatly blessed what he has done.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This year there will be many messages especially dealing with faith in the "Spiritual Instructions" column.</S>
