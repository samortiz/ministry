<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover the matter of Christ&rsquo;s person in creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">C. IN CREATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Creator</h2>
<p>Christ is the Creator. Since God is the Creator of all things and since Christ is God, He surely is also the Creator of all things. This is clearly revealed in Hebrews 1:10: &ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.&rdquo; This verse, a quotation from Psalm 102:25, is applied to Christ the Son and indicates that, as God, Christ created heaven and earth. Therefore, Christ is the Creator of the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Word through Whom<br />
All Things Came into Being</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the Creator but also the Word through whom all things came into being. He is not only the Creator but also the means through which creation came into existence. Speaking of Christ as the Word, John 1:3 says, &ldquo;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.&rdquo; Here we see that creation came into being through the Word, which is Christ. What does it mean that all things came into being through Him and that apart from Him nothing has come into being? It simply means that apart from Him nothing has existence. One day, through the Word as the means, many things came into being.</p>
<p>We may say that, in a sense, the Creator did not need to work in order to make anything, for there was no need for Him to do anything. He simply spoke, and everything had being. According to our concept, creation requires labor. However, in God&rsquo;s creation there was no labor, only speaking. When God said, &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; light came into existence. When He said, &ldquo;Let there be an expanse,&rdquo; the expanse came into being. When He said, &ldquo;Let the dry land appear,&rdquo; the dry land appeared. Through the all-inclusive Christ as the Word all things came into being.</p>
<p>Do you know what creation is? Creation is the calling of things not being as being through the Word (Rom. 4:17). The Word is both the means and the sphere of creation.</p>
<p>We may not differentiate Christ as the Creator from Christ as the means of creation. Even we may interpret John 1:3 as meaning that the Word is the Creator of all things. However, this verse does not say that the Word was the Creator; instead, this verse says that through the Word all things came into being, indicating that the Word was the means through which the Creator created all things. Christ is both the Creator and the means by which all things were created.</p>
<p>Although as God Christ is the Creator, John 1:3 reveals that as the Word He was the means of creation. According to this verse, all things came into existence through Christ. The King James Version of John 1:3 says, &ldquo;All things were made by him.&rdquo; However, this is not an accurate translation. The Greek preposition should be rendered &ldquo;through&rdquo; and not &ldquo;by.&rdquo; Hence, this verse does not say that all things were created by Christ but that all things came into existence through Christ. This indicates that Christ is the means of creation.</p>
<p>Christ is in fact the Creator of all things. The point we are emphasizing here is that Christ is the Word through whom all things came into being. He is the means of creation.</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not come into being from things which appear.&rdquo; We need to consider this verse along with the last part of Hebrews 1:2, which says that through Christ the universe was made. Scientists are trying to learn how the universe was framed. According to the book of Hebrews, the universe was framed through Christ as the Word of God. God spoke, and the universe came into being. Christ as the Word of God to be the means through which God&rsquo;s creation came into being implies also that, as the means of God&rsquo;s creation, Christ speaks God, defines God, and explains God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 021-033) &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
