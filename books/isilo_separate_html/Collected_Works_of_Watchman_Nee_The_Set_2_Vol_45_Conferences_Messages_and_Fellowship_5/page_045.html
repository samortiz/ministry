It is coming out of your own house and your own tribe to stand on Moses' side and declare, "I am on the Lord's side."</p><p>There is a definite date when we are saved. In the same way, there has to be a definite date when we are consecrated. Just as salvation should not be delayed, our consecration should not be delayed. At the time of Moses, the Levites stood up in an absolute way on his side and declared, "We are on the Lord's side." Tonight you should declare that you belong to the Lord and that you are consecrating yourself to Him. Tonight may some declare, "I belong to the Lord. I am a consecrated one." If you consecrate yourself to the Lord this way, you will be like the Levites who came out of their own house and their own tribe.</p><p>If you consecrate yourself to the Lord this way, you will have to rise up to kill (Exo. 32:27). Your husband, brothers, friends, and those whom who love should have the mark of the sword on them. You should be like the Levites, who put the swords by their sides and went in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, slaying every man his brother, companion, and neighbor. The sword of a consecrated one is turned outward to kill. Those who are consecrated cannot be afraid of hurting others. Of course, while the killing is done on others, the real hurt is in one's own flesh. When a consecrated one draws his sword to kill, the real hurt is to himself.</p><p>I am not saying that you have to do this by yourself. I am saying that if a man lives in the light and if his eyes are opened to redemption, he will behave this way spontaneously. Romans 12:1 says, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice." This presenting has to be done by yourself. Those who are consecrated to the Lord are living sacrifices on the altar. This means that when a consecrated one rises up to kill, the hurt of the sword is felt by him, even though he puts his sword on his brother or his neighbor. The sword is applied to others, but the hurt is in himself. A consecrated person can rise up to slaughter things, events, and people because he has first been slaughtered. If a man has never passed through the cross, he cannot live the consecrated life. Tonight may some pray, "Lord! You have purchased me. Because of this, I consecrate everything to You. Because of Your redemption, I am willing to be killed, burned, and removed." Such a heart will cut off all fleshly activities. Only such "Levites" can become the real firstborn.</p><p>In order to have the Passover, the lamb must be killed. The killing in this case refers to Christ's death. But the killing of the Levites refers to our death. The first killing secures our salvation, while the second killing fulfills the true meaning of redemption. A genuinely consecrated person is one who chooses to be one of God's people and who stands on His side. Only those who will draw their swords to kill are qualified to be God's genuine people. Being part of God's people is something common, but drawing one's sword to kill is not common. We can divide the world into two classes of people: those who are saved and those who are unsaved. We can also divide the church into two classes of people: those who are consecrated and those who are not willing to be consecrated. May we, by the mercy of the Lord, be those who are consecrated.</p><p>I hope the message tonight will open our eyes to see that a redeemed person must consecrate himself. Those who want to consecrate themselves must know the real significance of redemption. Only the consecrated ones can serve. Service is the result of consecration. May the Lord drive away any fear in the matter of our consecration so that we may not lose the Lord's sovereign rights on us through our fear of this and that kind of thing.</p><p>Prayer: May those who hear this word say when they return home that consecration is the only way to serve You. Show us that service is the result of consecration. Do not allow us to have any fear in this regard and do not allow us to sacrifice Your sovereign rights in us. Grant us to be the real Levites, standing on God's side. Give us the sword to kill all the things that are not of God. May we not care for human affections, ourselves, or anything. May these feeble words produce some effect in us. In Your victorious name we pray, amen!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
