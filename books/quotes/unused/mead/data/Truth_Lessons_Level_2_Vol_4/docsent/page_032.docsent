   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Means for Us to Take Christ as Our Righteousness by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Galatians 5:5 says, "We by the Spirit out of faith eagerly await the hope of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By the Spirit here is in contrast to by the flesh 3:3 , and out of faith is in contrast to out of the works of law 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our hope of righteousness is Christ Himself 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not out of the works of law in the flesh but out of faith in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not have our own merit before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our only merit is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is by the Spirit and by faith that we await Christ as the hope of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now in the divine fellowship, through the Spirit and by faith we have Christ as the righteousness that we live out daily.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>41.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Witnessing with Our Spirit That We Are the Children of God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the witnessing of the Spirit when we cry "Abba, Father" v. 15 . Such a witnessing testifies to us and assures us that we are the children of God, who possess His life; it also limits us and restricts us to a living and walk that are according to this life, in keeping with our being children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, it is not only that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also; rather, it is that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that our spirit must take the initiative to witness first; then the Spirit will witness with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This also reveals that the Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These two spirits are one; they live together, work together, and exist together as one mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the indwelling Spirit's witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God is a matter of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we enjoy the supply of the Spirit in the fellowship of the Triune God, we have the sweet and intimate inward sense that we are God's children.</S>
