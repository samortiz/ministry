<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class="title">RESURRECTION,<br />THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 13, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow<br />Scripture Reading:Acts 2:24-28, 31-34; 1 Cor. 12:12-13; Eph. 1:19-23</h1><h2 class="head1">THREE SUBJECTS OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>The Bible mainly speaks of three subjects. The first is resurrection, the second is the Holy Spirit, and the third is the church. The human mind cannot comprehend these three things because they are beyond human imagination and description. All three things are revealed to us by the Spirit of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN'S CREATION BEING INCOMPLETE</h2><p>In order to understand these things, we have to go back to Genesis. When man was created by God, he was created perfect, but not complete. Other forms of creatures were both perfect and complete, but man was perfect yet not complete. After God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Man was free to choose between the two. This proves that God's creation of man was not complete. In God's eyes man was not complete. Even though man did not have the knowledge of good and evil, he needed God's life, as typified by the tree of life. When man was created, he was living, but he did not have God's life. He needed to take one more step. Man is not complete until he has God's life (typified by the tree of life). However, before man ate of the tree of life, he first ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He made the wrong choice and delayed his completion. Therefore, man has not reached the peak of his potential. In God's eyes man is still short of something. Today, even at his loftiest height, man is still short of God's glory. Man is limited, and even at his best he is still short. We can say that the whole Old Testament, from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Malachi, is a development of the creation story; it is a continuation of God's creation. Although Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, etc., were good, they were still short in God's eyes; they were not able to reach God's original goal in His creation. Although they had God's image, they did not have His likeness. Image refers to the outward shape while likeness refers to inward character and disposition.</p><p>During the past six thousand years, God's work of creation in man has not stopped. God has made no advance as far as the creation of other species is concerned. He has not created more kinds of flowers, birds, horses, etc. These things were complete and perfect from the day they were created; there was no room for improvement, but man has never been completed. In Genesis 1:26 God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." Man is created according to God's image and likeness. The word image signifies outward appearance; it does not refer to the inward nature. Adam was created a living soul. He did not have God's Spirit in him. Therefore, he was not complete; he was an unfinished piece. Adam needed God Himself, typified by the tree of life, to be his very nature.</p><p>Man did not reach God's standard at the time of Genesis. This went on until the time of the Lord Jesus. Adam had God's outward appearance, but he was not like God in his nature. When he fell, he came short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). He lost God's likeness. Before the Lord Jesus was incarnated, there was not a single man on earth up to the standard. Sages of past centuries have tried to reach the standard through their asceticism and stoic practices, but they are still short of God. There is a distinction between the Old Testament and the New Testament. In the Old Testament man did not reach God's goal. In the New Testament one man was after God's heart. He is the complete man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS BEING THE ONLY COMPLETED MAN</h2><p>Thank the Lord! What God longed for in ages past, but did not find, is finally here in the New Testament. That man is Christ. In the Lord Jesus God found the man whom He was after. The Lord Jesus is the model man. Christ is not merely a representative of man; He is a representative man. He is the man whom God is after.</p>
