   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The brothers and sisters should have thorough fellowship with one another, even concerning practical things related to their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should have fellowship with one another to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we fellowship in such a way, we receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may feel that we should only fellowship with those around us about the messages we have read or some other spiritual activity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of course, our fellowship should include this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, our fellowship should also include many practical things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have discovered that the biggest shortage among us is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our problem is that we do not have the habit to fellowship, and many of us do not like to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize that when we fellowship, the Lord is involved.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should try to have fellowship with our fellow believers as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This divine fellowship not only corrects us; it also molds us and even reconstitutes us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This fellowship brings the divine constituent into our spiritual being, causing a change in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP BEING THE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF LIVING IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The divine fellowship is the reality of living in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord has been frustrated throughout the centuries because of the lack of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Revelation 22:20 the Lord Jesus said, "I come quickly," but it has been nearly two thousand years, and the Lord is still not back.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason is that the believers are individualistic, independent, opinionated, and divisive.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By being restricted in this fellowship, the Body of Christ is kept in oneness, and the work of the ministry continues to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are out of fellowship, everything is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The thing which makes everything alive is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we learn to fellowship, we will receive many benefits, especially in the Lord's work.</S>
