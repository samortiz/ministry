<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ELISHA'S MINISTRY OF GRACE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 2:19-25; 4:1&#151;6:7</H1><P>In this message we will consider what is revealed in 2 Kings concerning Elisha's ministry of grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ELIJAH BEING A TYPE OF JOHN THE BAPTIST<br>IN CONVICTING PEOPLE UNTO DEATH</H2><P>Elijah was a type of John the Baptist in convicting people unto death (Luke 1:17; Matt. 11:11, 14; 3:1-2, 6-11a). John the Baptist, who came before Christ, ushered in Christ. This is typified by Elijah's ushering in Elisha.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. ELISHA BEING A TYPE OF CHRIST<br>IN DOING MIRACLES OF GRACE IN LIFE</H2><P>Elisha was a type of Christ in doing miracles of grace in life. Elijah did some great miracles, such as closing up the heavens so that it might not rain and calling down fire from heaven to consume the burnt offering and the water that had been poured upon it. However, when Elisha came in to replace him, he did not perform wonders. Instead, Elisha did miracles of grace in life.</P><P>Many Christians pay attention to miracles, but they neglect the matters of grace and life or speak of them in a very shallow way. Paul emphasized grace very much in the book of Romans. In Romans justification by grace is unto the reigning in life (3:24; 5:17-18). Grace in life is, therefore, a crucial matter in Romans.</P><P>Grace is God doing everything for us by giving Himself to us as our enjoyment. This grace issues in the divine life, which is rich and high, even unto making us co-kings with Christ. However, among today's Christians it is not likely that one will hear a message telling the believers that God's grace issues in the divine life for us to reign as kings.</P>
