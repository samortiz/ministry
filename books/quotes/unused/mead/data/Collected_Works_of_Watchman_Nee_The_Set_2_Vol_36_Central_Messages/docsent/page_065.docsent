   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ as Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If our righteousness before God is our conduct, we can never be secure, because our conduct can be good at times and bad at other times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even if our conduct is good, this goodness is limited and can never come up to God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But thank the Lord that our righteousness before God is not our conduct, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we cannot be shaken before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may not be too strong today and may not be too good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan will come and say that we are worth nothing and that God does not want us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What should we say?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should say, "Satan, you have forgotten that my righteousness before God is not my good conduct yesterday; neither is it my not-so-good conduct today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My righteousness before God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If Christ has not changed, my righteousness has not changed either."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are putting on our own garment, it will be torn and ragged, and we will not see God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we can put on Christ and have the boldness to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is salvation, and this is liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the foundation of all Christian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we ask a brother who knows God's Word, "Will your righteousness ever fail?", he will say no. If we ask, "Will your conduct ever fail?", he will say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His righteousness will not fail, but his conduct will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His righteousness is not his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If his righteousness is his conduct, his righteousness will surely fail when his conduct fails.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thank the Lord that his righteousness is not his conduct, which can fail; his righteousness is the Christ who can never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thank the Lord that Christ can never fail, and as such, our righteousness will never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our righteousness will never fail inasmuch as Christ will never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This seems to be a very bold statement, but this is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our righteousness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will not fail; therefore, our righteousness will never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some may then ask, "Does this mean that it no longer matters if our conduct is good or bad?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We see from the Bible that Christians have two garments.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One is the Lord Jesus, as mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus is our garment; He is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The other is the bright and clean fine linen mentioned in Revelation 19:8.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Note that righteousnesses here is plural; it is individual righteous acts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, all the good conduct and outward righteousness of a Christian come by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are the result of the work of the Holy Spirit in man; they are not things that man possesses by his natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we come before God, the Lord Jesus is our garment; He is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not naked; we come to God by putting on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, when we appear before the judgment seat of Christ, we must have our own righteousnesses, which are the righteous acts of the saints 2 Cor 5:10; 1 Cor 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this chapter we are speaking of Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This does not refer to the righteous acts which believers have in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a precious word in the Old Testament: "Jehovah our righteousness" Jer 23:6; 33:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jehovah is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, our righteousness is not our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the Lord truly open our eyes to see that this is the gospel; this is the foundation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we come to God, our righteousness is not our conduct; Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jehovah is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We come to God by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What can be more secure and unshakable than Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every time we come to God, we have to remember that Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah, Christ is our righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we see that Christ is our righteousness, we can stand boldly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we come to Him, we should say to Him like a child, "I have come to You today with Christ on me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Look."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God looks at us again and again, He will find no fault in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more He looks at this garment, the more He will find it perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is because Christ is faultless; He is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Ephesians 1:6 says, "...His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are accepted in the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God accepted His Beloved, and we are accepted by God in His Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we are accepted in the Beloved, we are accepted as the Beloved is accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we are accepted in the Beloved, God accepts us as much as He has accepted His own Son.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He accepts those who are in the Beloved in the same way that He has accepted His Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whatever position the Beloved has, those who are in Him share the same.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is most glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When Balak asked Balaam to curse God's people the Israelites, what did Balaam say when he tried to do so?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He said, "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob;/Nor has He seen trouble in Israel./Jehovah their God is with them,/And the shout of a king is among them" Num 23:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although Balaam was a greedy prophet, he was not speaking from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God made Balaam say that He beheld no iniquity in Jacob or trouble in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Balaam could only speak as God told him to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In contrast, when the Israelites heard the bad news from the spies and murmured against God, He told them, "Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you, all who were counted, from twenty years old and above, who have murmured against Me, shall by no means come into the land in which I solemnly swore that I would make you dwell, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun" 14:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As far as their conduct was concerned, they had definitely sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have also definitely sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not think that the Israelites were good and without sin because of Balaam's words.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God did not say that the Israelites had good conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was merely saying that there was a righteousness with the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Through the sacrifice that they had offered, and through the righteousness of the sacrifice, God beheld no iniquity in Jacob and no trouble in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We know that the sacrifice typifies the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We can come boldly to God because we are in Christ and because we are accepted in the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our righteousness before God is as perfect as Christ's. Since Christ is our righteousness, God can find no sin in us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we accept the Lord Jesus as our Savior, God sees us as if we have never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must never have the thought that we are still a sinner and cannot be sure of our position before God, even though our sins have been forgiven by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must not think that we still have a trace of sin and cannot be at peace, even though our past sins have been forgiven through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Thank God that He has put us into Christ; we can stand before Him as if we have never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is why God could say that He beheld no iniquity in Jacob and no trouble in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we come to God by Christ, will we not have boldness?</S>
