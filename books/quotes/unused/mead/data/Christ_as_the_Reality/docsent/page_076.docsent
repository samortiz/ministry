   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE IN APPRECIATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another point concerning the peace offering is the difference in the appreciation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is seen in the different sizes of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some might offer a cow, a large offering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Others might offer a lamb, which is smaller.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Still others might offer a goat.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all know that in the Bible a goat is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sheep are good, but goats are not good see Matt 25:32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why then does the Bible present something which is not so good as a type of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ, of course, is always good, but sometimes those of us who are the presenters of Christ are not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are not like a lamb, but rather like a goat with two horns.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, a goat is rather wild; it is not mild like a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are times when we realize that the dear one who is offering Christ as the peace offering to God is rather wild.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is the feeling that this presenter is just like a wild goat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is not gentle like a lamb, but he is rather like a goat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ Himself is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But there can be a difference in our presentation and appreciation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is different in the offering not because of Himself, but because of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes we appreciate Christ as a large cow and sometimes as a little lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I am afraid that most of the time our appreciation of Christ is rather wild and is just like a goat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So we need some improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord does not need any improvement, but we need improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a real difference in the apprehension, experience, and appreciation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, there is a difference in the presentation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What we offer in the church meetings depends very much upon our daily experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If in our daily walk we experience Christ in a certain way, then surely when we come to the church meeting, we will present Christ in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we experience Christ in our daily walk in a mild way, then surely we will present Christ in the meeting in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if we experience Christ daily in a wild way, then, of course, we can only present Christ in the meeting in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What we present in the meetings depends upon what we enjoy and experience in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we enjoy Him more, then we can present more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we enjoy Him less, then we will present less.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all know that in Christianity, most of the so-called services do not depend upon the presenter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a sense, they may not have any presenters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mainly, they have simply the pew members.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since they do not have any presenters, their meetings do not depend upon the members, but upon the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If they have a good speaker, then they consider that a good service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they have a poor speaker, that is a poor service.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the church meeting is different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The meetings of the church do not depend upon a speaker, but entirely upon the presenters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may even have a poor speaker, yet the church can still have the very best meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because in the church all the presenters are the rich ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we can realize that the church meeting is not a Christianity service, but an enjoyable feast of all those who apprehend, experience, and appreciate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They bring the Christ whom they experience to their meeting and present Him to God, and this portion is God's food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE WAVE BREAST AND HEAVE SHOULDER</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With the peace offering there is also the wave breast and the heave shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The shoulder here, as we have mentioned, means the leg.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The breast is the loving part, and the leg is the strengthening part.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The leg is not only for walking, but also for standing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our standing strength depends upon our two legs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we are weak, we simply cannot stand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But as long as we can stand, we are sound and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is why the heave offering is so transcendent and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The breast is the wave offering in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The love of Christ is really living and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>So we have the breast as the loving part of Christ and the shoulder as the strengthening part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The shoulder is only for the serving priest, and the breast is for all the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The wave breast is loving and tender, but it is not as strong as the leg.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why the leg is for the ministering priest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then the meat of the peace offering is for the presenter, and there is also a portion for the presenter to share with all the clean ones.</S>
