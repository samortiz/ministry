Come to the wedding feast.</p><p>8 &nbsp;Then he said to his slaves, The wedding feast is ready, but those who have been called were <sup>1</sup>not worthy.</p> <p>9 &nbsp;Go therefore to the crossroads, and as many as you find, call to the wedding feast.</p><p>11 &nbsp;But when the king came in to look at those reclining at table, he saw there a man who was not clothed with a <sup>1</sup>wedding garment.</p><p>13 &nbsp;Then the king said to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and <sup>1</sup>cast him out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</p> <p class="bold">14 &nbsp;For many are <sup>1</sup>called but few are <sup>1</sup>chosen.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>2<sup>1</sup> The parable of the vineyard in ch. 21 refers to the Old Testament, in which was the kingdom of God (21:43), whereas the parable of a wedding feast in this chapter refers to the New Testament, in which is the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>In the foregoing parable (21:33-46) the Lord illustrated how the Jews, who were in the kingdom of God, would be punished, and how the kingdom of God would be taken from them and given to the kingdom people. Another parable was needed for Him to illustrate how the kingdom people, who are in the kingdom of the heavens, will be dealt with strictly. Both parables indicate that the kingdom is a serious matter.</p><p>2<sup>2</sup> The king is God, and the son is Christ.</p><p>2<sup>3</sup> In the foregoing parable the Old Testament was likened to a vineyard, with the focus mainly on the matter of labor under the law; in this parable the New Testament is likened to a wedding feast, with the focus mainly on the matter of enjoyment under grace.</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> These are the first group of New Testament apostles.</p><p>4<sup>1</sup> Both the oxen and the fatted cattle refer to Christ, who was killed so that God&#8217;s chosen people could enjoy Him as a feast.</p><p>8<sup>1</sup> The rejection by the Jews made them unworthy to enjoy the New Testament (Acts 13:46).</p><p>11<sup>1</sup> This wedding garment is typified by the embroidered garment in Psa. 45:14 and is signified by the fine linen in Rev. 19:8 (see note 2 there). This is the surpassing righteousness of the overcoming believers, mentioned in 5:20 (see note 1 there). The man not clothed with a wedding garment is saved, because he has come to the wedding feast. He has received Christ as his righteousness that he might be justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:26), but he has not lived Christ out as his subjective righteousness (Phil. 3:9) that he might participate in the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens. He has been called to salvation, but he has not been chosen for the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens, which is for the overcoming believers only.</p><p>13<sup>1</sup> To be cast out into the outer darkness is not to perish; it is to be dealt with dispensationally, to be disqualified from participating in the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium, for not having lived by Christ an overcoming life. In the millennium the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom (Col. 3:4), whereas the defeated believers will suffer discipline in outer darkness (see note 122 in ch. 8).</p><p>14<sup>1</sup> To be called is to receive salvation (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 4:1), whereas to be chosen is to receive a reward. All believers have been called, but few will be chosen to receive a reward.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 681-690; Hymns: #1304</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Matthew, Vol. 4 (21:23-28:20) &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
