   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ first suffered and then entered into glory Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should follow Him in the same steps 1 Pet 4:13; Rom 8:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sufferings of Christ, as revealed to the prophets and prophesied by them in Psalm 22:1, 6-8, 12-18; Isaiah 53:2-10a, 12b; Daniel 9:26; and Zechariah 12:10 and 13:6-7, are for the accomplishment of God s redemption, which has solved all the problems between man and God, and terminated the old creation on the negative side, and has released the eternal life of God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The glories of Christ are for His glorification, which He asked of the Father before His crucifixion John 17:1 , and which is for the execution of God s New Testament economy for the carrying out of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sufferings of Christ and the glorification of Christ with the glories in different steps the factors of God s full redemption and salvation being applied to us and experienced by us, equal the salvation mentioned in 1 Peter 1:5, 9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what the prophets in the Old Testament sought and searched out, what the Spirit of Christ revealed to them, what the apostles preached in the New Testament by the Holy Spirit, and what the angels longed to look into v. 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Literally of Christ is unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sufferings Christ endured were sufferings assigned to Him by God Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, they are of Him, belonging to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The glories are in different steps: the glory in Christ s resurrection Luke 24:26; Acts 3:13 , the glory in His ascension Acts 2:33; Heb 2:9 , the glory in His return Rev 18:1; Matt 25:31 , and the glory in His reign 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4, 6 , as revealed in Psalm 16:8-10; 22:21-22; 118:22-24; 110:1, 4; 118:26; Zechariah 14:4-5; Daniel 7:13-14; and Psalm 24:7-10; 72:8-11.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is unusual for the word glory to be used in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you know of another writing that speaks of glories?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abstract nouns are not usually used in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Solid nouns, however, are often used in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Glory is an abstract noun.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But to Peter glory is not abstract; on the contrary, it is very solid.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Peter s understanding, Christ has many glories, one glory after another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has a glory in resurrection, another glory in ascension, and other glories in enthronement, lordship, kingship, and reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has a glory in His humanity and another glory in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ does not have only one kind of glory; He has many glories.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The prophets searched into these glories.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They learned what time Christ would come to suffer and what time He would enter into all His glories.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE SPIRIT S PRACTICAL APPLICATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>OF GOD S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 12 Peter goes on to say, To whom it was revealed that not to themselves, but to you they ministered these things, which have now been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; which things angels long to look into.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These things refer to the sufferings of Christ and His glories.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Old Testament prophets ministered the sufferings and glories of Christ to the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These things have been announced to us through those who preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The ones who preached the gospel were the apostles of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The prophets searched and prophesied; the apostles preached.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The preaching of the apostles is the Spirit s practical application of God s salvation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both the prophesying of the prophets and the preaching of the apostles were the application of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that the Spirit applies God s full salvation by two instrumentalities, the prophesying of the prophets and the preaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In my ministry I am preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I believe that through this preaching the Spirit is applying God s full salvation to you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not my goal actually to train anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, I simply preach Christ, the death of Christ, and the different glories of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Each preaching is an application of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who attend the meetings of the ministry are under the application of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My greatest joy is to see the saints receive Christ through the application of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am especially happy to see the second generation growing up in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My heart leaps when I see that they are receiving the application of God s salvation through this ministry and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I encourage you all to go forth and preach Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The apostles are not the only ones who can preach.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as you preach Christ, you are included among those who preach the gospel by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THINGS WHICH ANGELS LONG TO LOOK INTO</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Peter ends verse 12 with the words which things angels long to look into.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Greek word rendered look into portrays one stooping and stretching the neck to look at some wonderful sight.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This shows how interested the angels are in observing the things concerning Christ for God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They declared and celebrated the Savior s birth Luke 2:8-14 , they rejoice over the sinner repenting to receive salvation Luke 15:10 , and they are happy to serve those who inherit salvation Heb 1:14; Acts 12:15; Matt 18:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After speaking concerning the prophets in the Old Testament and the preachers in the New Testament, Peter suddenly speaks concerning the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While the angels are serving us, they are stooping down to look into the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As part of one sentence concerning God s full salvation, we have the prophets, the preachers, and the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is characteristic of Peter s writing.</S>
