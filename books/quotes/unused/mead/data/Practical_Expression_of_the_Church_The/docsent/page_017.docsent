   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to keep the unity of the faith and not be carried away by the wind of doctrine, we need the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we remain in childhood, we may be easily carried away by the wind of some doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The doctrines may be good, but they are simply toys.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Toys are not wrong, but toys are for children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The younger you are, the more you enjoy toys.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do you still toy with doctrines?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I can assure you that the more you grow in the Lord, the more you will drop the toys of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 4:14-15 tells us clearly what doctrine can do if we have not grown up into Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we are children, it is easy for the subtle enemy to deceive us by using certain doctrines to distract us from the proper church life, as a wind carrying us away from the proper course.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because children like toys, and the doctrines are just like toys!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we grow in life, the more we will drop the toys of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Forty years ago, baptism by immersion was a real toy to me, and so were many other doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But by His mercy, I can hardly say what toy of doctrine I still have today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must learn never to insist on any doctrine, but just upon the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Doctrines divide; only the faith unites.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to be delivered from the toys of all kinds of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, it must not be an outward deliverance, but a deliverance issuing from the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While we are still growing, we must realize that we should not insist on any toy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as the saints believe in the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, incarnated to be a man, dying on the cross for our sins, resurrected and ascended to the heavens, we must be one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Lord Jesus is our unique center, there will be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>INSISTING ON NOTHING BUT THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While I was visiting some places in this country, there were some who asked whether it was scriptural to be baptized more than once.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I did not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have grown in the Lord, we will not pay much attention to doctrinal things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All we will care for is the faith and the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some people are offended by sisters having their head covered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That is in large measure a matter of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as a sister feels that she must cover her head, there is no need to oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But there are also some who impose head-covering, making it a legalistic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the other extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some oppose pray-reading, and some condemn loud praising.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All this is dissenting opinion and unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as people take the Word of God and praise the Lord, regardless of the way we prefer that they do it, we should not oppose them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do, we go too far.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, if we insist on these things and impose them upon others, we go too far in the other direction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since we have seen that the local church is the practical expression of the church, we should not insist on anything but the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If anyone says the Lord Jesus is not the Son of God, we must contend for it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is contending for the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if a sister feels she does not need to have her head covered, she should be left to act according to her own feeling in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the church life, and this is keeping the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regarding matters of dissent, the Apostle teaches in Romans 14:1-6 that we should take a very liberal attitude in receiving one another in order to keep the unity of the Body.</S>
