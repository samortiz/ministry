   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would have a proper Christian daily life, we need to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is significant that the New Testament does not charge us to walk according to the Scriptures, but to walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Galatians 5:16 Paul says, Walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 25 he goes on to say, If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are to conduct ourselves not according to teaching or doctrine, but according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today the Spirit is the very Christ who has come into our spirit and who is now mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our need is to live according to this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more we live by walking according to the mingled spirit, the more we shall be filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we shall know how to call on the name of the Lord, how to speak to others, and how to sing and testify.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we develop these habits, our meetings will spontaneously be an exhibition of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How different are such meetings from the formal religious services of today s Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE PRODUCT OF OUR DAILY LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must admit that we are still under the influence of traditional Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were born into this environment and raised under this influence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the Lord s recovery we must cast off traditional Christianity, especially the traditions related to formal meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our meetings should not have a formal beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, they should begin spontaneously through our exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, I say again that this kind of meeting is the product of the exercise of our spirit to experience Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not exercise our spirit in our daily living, whatever we do in the meetings will be a performance, not the spontaneous exhibition of our daily Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we walk in spirit day by day, no one will be able to predict how the meetings will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We shall simply gather together to have a spontaneous exhibition of the riches of Christ for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of the influence of tradition and the natural concept, it is very easy for us to meet in a systematized way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The meetings may be formal and altogether devoid of the spontaneity of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, we need release!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need liberation!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this release and liberation cannot begin with a performance in the meetings; it must begin with the exercise of the spirit in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our daily living we should be a certain kind of person, one who contacts the Lord, calls on His name, speaks to others about Him, and who sings praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then when we come to the church meetings, we should continue to be this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way our activity in the meetings will exhibit our exercise in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not realize how much we are still under the killing influence of religious tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Be assured, we are still too much under the tradition of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may ask what we can do about it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The only thing for us to do is to exercise our spirit to have intimate contact with the Lord as a living Person day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not try to adjust ourselves or improve our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, we should not endeavor to be spiritual or holy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Forget about all these things and simply pay attention to the index of the Lord s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead of trying to be spiritual, we should simply live in the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to make a declaration to Satan and to the whole universe: I don t know the meaning of holiness or spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I only know that Christ is my life and my person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today He is living within me, and I am living according to the index of His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My only desire is to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not care whether I love or hate, whether I am angry or calm.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I care only to take Christ as my person and to be one with Him in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>EXHIBITING CHRIST FOR UPLIFTED MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In our Christian dictionary there should be just one word Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is our humility, our patience, our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What sweetness there is in our daily life when we take Christ as everything!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How marvelous to live according to the index of His eyes!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a living is filled with calling, speaking, singing, and praising.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If this is our daily experience, then in the meetings there will be no performing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the contrary, we shall release our spirit spontaneously to exhibit Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If all the saints have such a daily living, the meetings will be genuine, rich, and uplifted, altogether different from anything we have experienced before.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Let us set aside our natural concept of what a meeting should be.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord has shown us clearly that a proper meeting is the exhibition of our daily living as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the meetings we should not focus our attention on singing, preaching, or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our focus must be the exhibition of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are clear about this, we shall realize that no one can teach us how to have a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Teaching will lead only to a performance, never to an exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let us all look to the Lord for mercy and say, Lord, we have been veiled by religion and distracted from Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Lord, bring us back to Yourself, back from so many good, spiritual, and even scriptural things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Cause us to know Christ and Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have the full assurance that the Lord intends to recover our intimate daily contact with Himself and our living by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In particular, I expect the Lord to gain the young people in this regard because they are less under the influence of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let us all rise up to repudiate traditional Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we repudiate the religious traditions and care only for the living Christ, we shall have a proper spirit, a spirit of power, love, and a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then in the meetings we shall bubble over with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more we speak of the Lord, the more we shall have to say.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Oh, may we all be simple and return to Christ Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let us forget the religious traditions and all formal practices.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord is calling us back to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our urgent need is to live and walk in the spirit and then to exhibit corporately our daily living in Christ.</S>
