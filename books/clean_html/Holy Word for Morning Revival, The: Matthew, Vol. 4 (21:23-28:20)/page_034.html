<p class="bold">WEEK 20 — DAY 5</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 28:1-2, 5-9</h2><p>1 &nbsp;Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the <sup>1</sup>first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.</p> <p class="bold">2 &nbsp;And behold, there was a great <sup>1</sup>earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended out of heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.</p><p class="bold">5 &nbsp;And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the crucified.</p><p class="bold">6 &nbsp;He is not here, for He has been raised, even as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying.</p> <p>7 &nbsp;And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has been raised from the dead, and behold, He goes before you into <sup>1</sup>Galilee. There you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.</p> <p class="bold">8 &nbsp;And they went away quickly from the tomb with <sup>1</sup>fear and great joy and ran to report this to His disciples.</p> <p class="bold">9 &nbsp;And behold, Jesus <sup>1</sup>met them, saying, Rejoice! And they came to Him and took hold of His feet and worshipped Him.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>1<sup>1</sup> Christ resurrected on the first day of the week. This signifies that His resurrection brought a new start with a new age for the kingdom of the heavens. See note 1<sup>1</sup> in John 20.</p><p>2<sup>1</sup> This signifies that the earth, the base of Satan’s rebellion, was shaken by the Lord’s resurrection.</p><p>7<sup>1</sup> The heavenly King began His ministry from Galilee of the Gentiles (4:12-17), not from Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jewish religion; after His resurrection He again went to Galilee, not to Jerusalem. This strongly indicates that the resurrected heavenly King had fully abandoned Judaism and had initiated a new age for God’s New Testament economy.</p><p>8<sup>1</sup> With fear because of the great earthquake (v. 2) and with great joy because of the Lord’s resurrection.</p><p>9<sup>1</sup> This took place after the Lord appeared to Mary the Magdalene (John 20:14-18).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The resurrection of Christ was a matter of God’s righteousness.…According to His righteousness, God had to judge Christ on the cross because Christ was bearing all our unrighteousness. But after God had judged Christ in full, God’s righteousness held Him responsible to release Christ from death and to raise Him up from among the dead.</p><p>We need to consider Romans 4:25. This verse says, “Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification.” This verse links resurrection with righteousness.…Therefore, Christ’s resurrection is a proof both of God’s righteousness and of our justification.…In the sphere of Christ’s resurrection, God is the righteous God, and we are the justified people of God. Here we have the kingdom.</p><p>The resurrection of Christ was first discovered by two sisters, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary. They discovered it by loving the Lord to the uttermost. Then they became the first two witnesses of the Lord’s resurrection.</p><p>The Jewish leaders with the Roman soldiers spread a false rumor about Christ’s resurrection [Matt. 28:11-15]. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money to say that the Lord’s disciples came by night and stole Him away while the guards slept. This word from the mouth of the religious leaders was a bare lie, indicating the lowest standard and falsehood of their religion. In verse 14 they said to the soldiers, “And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make sure that you have nothing to worry about.” The evil religionists always persuade the evil politicians to perpetrate falsehood. Verse 15 indicates that this lie concerning the Lord’s resurrection was widely spread, as were the rumors concerning His followers and His church after His resurrection (Acts 24:5-9; 25:7).
