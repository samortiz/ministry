   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Of course, Roman Catholicism is more seriously affected by Judaism, but the spirit of Judaism is prevailing everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everywhere in Protestantism one can see its influence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every revival and every split from a Protestant denomination unavoidably carries over the influence of the denomination out from which it came.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A place of preaching eventually becomes a chapel, and the preacher becomes part of a priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The believers unconsciously become the pew members of this new church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unity among Christians eventually turns into denominational affiliations, and the truth that God has specially used becomes a creed that is to be confessed by all.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What the conscience once condemned is now ignored unconsciously through the association of what pleases the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They still call themselves God's covenanted people as if no one else is such.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What charter or constitution of any denomination is there that does not demonstrate this spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is as if there is no church other than their own group.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To leave them is to leave "the church"!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet it says here that what they say are lies!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Under such circumstances, those who suffer the most are the Philadelphian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They have no name other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have no creeds or ordinances other than the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are often despised and are considered lowly and insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the disciples of Christ were despised and mocked before the great organization of Judaism, in the same way the Philadelphian believers now are looked down upon by the various, great, Judaistic Protestant denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse links Philadelphia with Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among the seven churches, only these two spiritual churches have such temptation and trial.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sin of Pergamos and Thyatira are not enough to shake them here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result the enemy uses a more subtle scheme.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, they have not only identified his devious harm but have opposed him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan's way here is to cause the desolate church to be further degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Judaism that God had once established and which He has now rejected has become the best weapon of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Philadelphia we see the believers seeking Christ afresh, the word of God being preached again and being honored anew.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result, Satan renews his old strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what the Bible shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although this is something that happens outside Philadelphia, God calls the Philadelphian saints to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although many believers have left the influence of the denominations, the same leaven is still working there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the clergy-laity system in the denominations, with its replacement of the conscience of the individual by the majority, has been overturned by many believers, we still see the principle of Judaism affecting man's thought and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, man will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Any work of man apart from God's grace is a realization of the teaching of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Unless believers are watchful, there is always the possibility for them to fall into the spirit or work of denominationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see the difference between a personal, faithful walk with God and the following of an established organization.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In an organization there are many things that the flesh can boast of.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are many formalities and plans to recover that which once was the outward fa ade of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But those in the organizations do not understand what God is establishing anew today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the test to those who follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although these ones have not rejected God's word neither have the Jews their works are not governed by God's word either.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Jews accepted the Bible, yet they rejected Christ and even killed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The disciples of Christ will receive the same kind of treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"They will put you out of the synagogues," thinking that they are serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"An hour is coming for every one who kills you to think that he is offering service to God" John 16:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The old truths have been around for a long time and have been properly accredited.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As such they do not test man's heart that much.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who receive them will, on the contrary, be respected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If by doing something we win man's approval, our heart will not be tested, and there will be no need for the exercise of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can be assured that this thing must not be from God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although this may still be the truth, there is no need for the exercise of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the work of the Jewish synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These ones have rejected the word of Christ and His name, because they do not have Christ in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is true that the Jews were indeed the people of God, but now they are trampling underfoot the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What they love is the truth in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The character of Christ is too much of a test for them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a result they reject Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The question now is not what God has done in the past, but how we should contact Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The unique need today is to serve Christ faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet and to know that I have loved you."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God allows these things to come upon His people to test them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet He promises the real Philadelphians the ultimate victory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their enemies will confess their defeat and will see that the Lord has loved them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although today is the time of despising for them, one day the Lord will spread a table for them before their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In that day their enemies will acknowledge that the ones they despise are the ones whom the Lord has loved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God has not acknowledged these orthodox religionists as His own people.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What they will receive will be a mere knowledge, a knowledge that the Lord has loved the despised remnants.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Other than this, there will be nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, we have to be careful and should consider if we are true Philadelphian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Of course, we will have to be tested in many ways, but the Lord's word here is enough to comfort our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our duty is not to argue about what is pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you know it, just go and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why is there the need for so many arguments?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In that day, it will become manifest where Christ's heart is today.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should know how to be content and how to trust in the love of Christ quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although those who confess with their mouth that they know God while denying Him in their walk do not approve of us now, we should be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the place for our hearts to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You can find here the orthodox sects, the well-known brands of denominations, and companions that will make you happy and rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But you must remember that to do so requires that you drop one thing the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we are content with the love of Christ today, we will see sunshine above the dark clouds.</S>
