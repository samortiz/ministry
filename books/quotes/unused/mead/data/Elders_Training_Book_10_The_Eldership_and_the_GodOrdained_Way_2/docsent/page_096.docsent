   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I would especially like to talk to the elders among us who are full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among the saints, you have to be the examples, the living ones who get three to five people saved every six months.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then you can labor so that one or two of them will remain in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not pleasant to see our co-workers serving the Lord full-time and yet not bringing anyone to the Lord within a year.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must labor in the gospel definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to bring forth some children by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should be able to point to some who are our spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to study how to contact people ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We still have much to learn in contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just to copy what others do does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord will show us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are definite and desperate to gain people, we will find a way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need to contact people directly and individually, laboring in the gospel two to three hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You should find out who is available for you to contact and then contact them directly and continually over a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You will gain one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you take this way of directly contacting people one by one, I can assure you that you will bring two people into the church every year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You should make a decision and tell the Lord that you will spend two to three hours every week in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then ask the Lord to lead you to contact people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should not stop going to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You should still live your regular church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You do not need to promote what you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You just need to go and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then gradually some will see what you are doing, and they will join you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have tried many ways in the last six years, and they may work, but they do not work satisfactorily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only the way of contacting people directly brings a satisfactory result.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to plan how to contact our acquaintances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to keep working on one of them directly, individually, and continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To get someone saved and established takes about six months, and to bring them into the church will take another six months.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may think that to bring one or two a year into the church life is too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But this slow way is actually the quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If twenty are meeting together in a locality, and five of them bring two people into the church life, that is a fifty percent increase.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I can assure you that this can be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Any other way will waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As branches of the Lord, we should give Him three hours a week for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we can pray, "Lord, lead me, teach me, and give me the wisdom in planning, in scheduling my time, in making appointments, and in talking to people."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we should practice this directly and definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Surely we will gain people for the Lord's kingdom.</S>
