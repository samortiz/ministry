<h2 class="head1">SALVATION BEING A MATTER OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Even though some parents are not Christians, they tell their children that it is better to have some form of religion than to have none. Furthermore, they often recommend Christianity, based on their perception of its superior doctrines. They may even say, &ldquo;Although Confucius said, &lsquo;What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others,&rsquo; Jesus said, &lsquo;All that you wish men would do to you, so also you do to them&rsquo;&rdquo; (Matt. 7:12). Thus, they realize that Jesus&rsquo; teaching is superior, because Confucius spoke of not doing negative things toward others, while the Lord spoke of doing positive things toward others. If our parents said this to us, how should we respond? We could nod in agreement and say, &ldquo;Yes, even though Confucius taught concerning negative things, the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in regard to positive things was extraordinary.&rdquo; Or we could say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus not only gave me superior teaching, but He also is the life-giving Spirit. The Lord Jesus is in me as the living Spirit, not as a doctrine or teaching.&rdquo; Then we could say, &ldquo;If a motor has only an instruction manual but no electricity, it has only outward teachings, but once electricity is transmitted into it, it will run. Likewise, without the Spirit of the Lord entering into me, no teaching has any impact. The Lord Jesus has entered into me, and He is living and powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to let our parents know that we have received not Christianity but the living Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit. The Lord Jesus is Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17); He is the Spirit in order to be our Savior. We love the Lord because He is the life-giving Spirit living in us, not because He is the founder of a religion. We even love our parents because Jesus is living in us and daily operating in us, not because we have received the teachings of Jesus. For example, when we are even slightly unhappy with our parents, the Lord Jesus bothers us inwardly.</p>
<p>There is a difference between religion and the Spirit. Our Savior is not a religion, nor is our salvation merely a matter of teaching. Our Savior is the life-giving Spirit. He is more than a rabbi with outward teachings; He is in us as our life. Nicodemus was concerned with religious teachings, but the Lord Jesus was focused on the Spirit when He said, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (John 3:6).</p>
<p>John 3 presents a man who is a teacher of others, and chapter 4 speaks of a disreputable Samaritan woman. Nevertheless, this woman also liked to talk about religion. When the Lord Jesus spoke of living water, she asked the Lord for this living water. However, the Lord responded by asking about her husband, saying, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (v. 16). The Lord asked about her husband because the disreputable aspect of her life was related to her many husbands. She responded with a &ldquo;truthful&rdquo; lie to the Lord. She answered and said, &ldquo;I do not have a husband&rdquo; (v. 17). Although we can lie to others, we can never lie to the Lord Jesus. All our lies will be exposed by the Lord. When the Lord Jesus heard this, He said, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). As soon as the Lord spoke truthfully about her condition, she changed the subject from her husband to religion and worship, saying, &ldquo;Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&rdquo; (vv. 19-20).</p>
<p>At first, the Samaritan woman spoke about whether or not worship was possible on a mountain and then whether worship needed to be in Jerusalem. She did not want to talk about her husband but about the matter of worship, and according to religious thought, worship is a matter of location and forms. In response, the Lord Jesus told her that worship is not a matter of location or forms, because &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&rdquo; (v. 24). When the Lord spoke of God being Spirit, He was referring to the substance of God being Spirit, and since God is Spirit, we must worship in spirit.</p>
<p>Nicodemus discussed matters of doctrine with the Lord, and the Samaritan woman discussed matters of religion. Although people like to talk about doctrines and religion, the Lord always answers with the divine Spirit and our human spirit, that is, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. If we want to know God, who is Spirit, we must exercise our spirit. We have a spirit, and when our spirit is regenerated by God&rsquo;s Spirit, we can exercise our spirit to worship God. This is not a matter of doctrine or teaching but a matter of the Spirit and our spirit. God is Spirit, and we have a spirit. Our spirit needs to be regenerated by God&rsquo;s Spirit, and God needs our spirit to worship Him. When the Spirit begets our spirit, our spirit can worship God, who is Spirit.</p>
<p>No matter what we are doing today, we must be clear that everything will pass away. The only thing that will last forever is the Spirit and our spirit. Only the Spirit and our spirit matter, not religion, teachings, or doctrines.</p>
