<h2 class=head1>MATTHEW 18:17</h2><p>We have already seen that in Matthew 18:17 the Lord Jesus only used the word “let him be.” Matthew 18 shows us that we must do our best to fellowship with a sinning brother. If he would not take our word, we should bring one or two brothers to help him. If he still would not listen to them, then this case should be referred to the church. If he still would not listen to the church, then what should we do? Should we throw him out and forget about him? The Lord’s word is to “let him be.” Let him be to you as a heathen and a tax collector. This matter is up to him. The Lord’s expression is very careful.<p>The foregoing verses in chapter 18 show us the reason why the Lord is so careful. In this foregoing portion, the Lord warns us that to stumble a little one is a serious matter (18:6). Matthew 18 is a chapter on the proper dealings with our fellow believers, our brothers. We must be careful. The Lord Jesus charges us firstly in Matthew 18 not to stumble “one of these little ones who believe in Me” (v. 6). To stumble a little one is a serious matter, yet this one may be sinful and may have just committed a sin. When you are going to deal with him, be careful. Do not stumble a sinful brother by your dealing with him. If your dealing with him is not proper, this dealing may stumble him for his whole life. Then who is responsible for this? Yes he was sinful, but you did not deal with him properly. Your wrong dealing stumbled him. With a proper dealing he might have been brought to the Lord. You might have had a good intention in your dealing with him, but the issue was his being stumbled.<h2 class=head1>NO NEED OF A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT</h2><p>Unconsciously we are still under the influence of the traditions of Christianity which are hidden in many aspects of our practice of the church life. This matter of excommunication comes from tradition. Also, we have always considered the proper time to make an announcement of a certain excommunication. We thought a public announcement was needed, but there is no hint in the New Testament that we need to make a public announcement. Even in 1 Corinthians 5, Paul did not say that the saints there had to make a public announcement. He only charged the church to remove the sinful brother.<p>In the past, we all thought there was the need of making a public announcement. We must see, however, that to make a public announcement of a kind of excommunication involves a person’s name, position, and status in today’s society. This is serious and very risky. This involves families and human relationships. In this matter we have been under the influence of the tradition of Christianity, but in my experiences over the past fifty years I have surely learned that to make a public announcement, especially in a matter concerning immorality, is not so safe and profitable. If we announce a certain person’s being excommunicated in a public meeting, he could appeal to a court of law and say that we are spoiling his name. He would claim that since you said he committed immorality, you must provide the evidence in a court of law. This would cause much trouble. This one may have committed that sin, but according to law you must present the evidence. This sinning one may not have that much growth in the Lord, but he may bold a high position in society. He would vindicate himself by bringing this case to the law court to clear up his name. This shows us the turmoil that such a public announcement could cause. Also, such, a public announcement could damage families. This could also cause a young female to have no way to go on, humanly speaking, and no way to live, especially in the Far East.<p>According to our present knowledge of the New Testament, I do not believe there is the need of making a public announcement. We just need to tell the sinning one, “We have been waiting for your repentance and, thus far, we could not see it. Since you know the Lord is holy and His table is holy, please stay away, not only from the Lord’s table but also from the church meetings.” This kind of fellowship is sufficient. If we know that this one is still contacting certain brothers and sisters, we may pray to seek the Lord’s wisdom concerning how to handle the situation and how to let the involved parties know. We must do things in this wise way with love, and we must be careful. In this matter there is a social element involved, so there is also a legal element involved. There is always some possibility that a person could bring the church to the law court.
