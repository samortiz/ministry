   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Offering Up Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Our Occupations to God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our views have to be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A man cannot say on the one hand that he is learning to serve God, while holding on to money on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord has no intention that we serve Him while engaging in some money-making occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I hope that we can offer up ourselves and our occupations to God for the accomplishment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Long-term, Normal Way</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Providing for Those of One's Own Household,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and Accepting the Arrangements</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Made by the Church</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During the time of revival of a church, there are special measures taken.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These special measures are different from the long-term measures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the time of revival, we have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in the long run there is the need for the church to make some arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the time of revival, Ananias could not keep back anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The minute he kept back anything, he was lying, and he was sinning against the Holy Spirit Acts 5:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in Paul's Epistles, we are told that a person has to provide for those of his own household and that we have to care for the widows who have no support 1 Tim 5:8-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the long run we do not expect the church to do the same things as it does during the time of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During revivals, we feel constrained to offer up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But during ordinary times, we have to take care of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Particularly, we have to take care of the children when they are young.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The long-term way for the church to deal with money is different from the way it takes during the time of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During revivals, we cannot quench the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in the long run the church has to make some arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the early churches, there were arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The brothers and sisters should also make their own arrangements before the Lord; they should save something for their own use, and they should set aside the rest as available funds.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way, even the jobs of the brothers and sisters become something that is for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everyone has to consider and reckon before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Where there are burdens that individuals cannot take up, other brothers and sisters have to come in to help.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church should not bear all the burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, the saints' relatives should be taken care of first by the saints themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Whole Body Coordinating Together</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>for the Accomplishment of God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our occupation must be such that we earn our wages through labor and through increasing the value of the goods.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today, it is not a sin to receive much, but it is a sin to have excess.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not wrong to take in much, but it is wrong to keep the excess.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to simplify our own living, and we have to save money for others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only those who have given to others know that indeed it is more blessed to give than to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The increase in bank deposits is just the increase in zeros; it will not give you joy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only those who save for God, who labor for God, and who increase the value of goods will have true joy in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we will practice this, the whole of China will be won by us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even the whole Southeast Asia will be won by us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can carry out our work under the best arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During the past years, there was not much coordination among the co-workers, and there was not much coordination among the brothers and sisters in their occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That is why we have not done well in both areas.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today, the occupations of the working brothers and sisters have to be coordinated, and the work of the co-workers also has to be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the coordination is solid and good, all the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs will become our true co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the Lord comes back soon, we will all see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the Lord delays His coming for another one or two hundred years, those coming after us will watch the way we conduct ourselves today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We believe that the Lord has set a straight path before us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our conference this time has much to do with God's business, the church's work, and the whole counsel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not a question of individuals doing business or making money.</S>
