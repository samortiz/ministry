<h2 class=head2>Christ’s Coming and Going to Produce the Mutual Dwelling of God and Man</h2><p>The Gospel of John reveals that the Father is in the Son, coming to be among humanity, and the Son became the Spirit to enter into humanity. His entering into man was accomplished by means of His going in death and His coming in resurrection. Christ’s going was not to leave the disciples but a further step to come into them. By the first step of incarnation He came to be among them. After that, He needed to take another step to enter into them. Incarnation was the first step of His coming, and death and resurrection was the second step.<p>Apparently Christ’s death was His going, but actually it was His coming. His going to die did not mean that He left the disciples. It only means that He took another step to get into them. Therefore, the Lord could say, “If I go…I am coming” (14:3). He seemed to be saying, “Do not be sorrowful. Do not think that I am going to leave you. I have come to you, but at this time I am only among you. This is only the first step; I cannot yet enter into you. I must do something further so that I can be in you. I must take a further step to die and resurrect. After death and resurrection, I will then be able to enter into you. Therefore, My going is My coming.” For this reason, the Gospel of John does not say that after Christ died and resurrected, He left the disciples. Instead, it tells us that after He died and resurrected, He came to them and entered into them.<p>In verse 20 the Lord said, “In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you,” and in verse 3 He said, “Where I am you also may be.” On “that day” the disciples would be where the Lord is. Where is the Lord? He is in the Father. Therefore, in that day they would be in the Father also. While the Lord was speaking this, they were not yet in the Father because Christ had not yet died and resurrected. The Lord was still in the form of the flesh. He needed to die and resurrect, and after His death and resurrection, He was transfigured into the Spirit. Then, at that time He was able to enter into the disciples. Since the Lord was in the Father and they were in Him, spontaneously they were also in the Father. It is in this way that the Lord brought them into the Father. Now where the Lord is, we are there also.<p>In this way God becomes our abode, and we become God’s abode, so in the following chapter there is the mutual abiding. John 15:4 says, “Abide in Me and I in you.” By His coming in incarnation, Christ brought God into man, and by His going through death and resurrection He brought man into God. Now God and man, man and God, become a mutual abode. We abide in God, and God abides in us. The way has been paved, and the fact has been accomplished. Now we simply enjoy this mutual abiding. Now, in the Father’s house, that is, in the temple of God, the church, each one of us not only has a place, but each one of us is a “place.” We not only have an abode; each one is an abode.<p>In Revelation 21 and 22 it is difficult to see who the dwellers are in the New Jerusalem. The twelve apostles are not, strictly speaking, the dwellers there; they are the foundations. We may compare them to bricks in a building. We do not say that bricks dwell in the building; they are only part of the building. But in another sense, the building becomes the dwelling place of the bricks. Similarly, when we are built into the church, the building of God becomes our dwelling place. All of the saved and redeemed ones are parts of the New Jerusalem. Who then is the dweller? It is the Triune God.
