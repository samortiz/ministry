   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ as the Young Lion</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Overcoming the Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 49:8 and 9 we see the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis, a marvelous book, is a book of pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his prophecy Jacob likened Judah to a lion in three aspects: a young lion, a couching lion, and a lioness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The young lion is for fighting, for seizing the prey.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 9 says, "Judah is a young lion: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words "thou art gone up" imply that the young lion first had to come down.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He came down from the mountain to the plain to capture his prey.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the young lion seized his prey, he went up to the mountaintop again to enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Christ was on earth and was crucified on the cross, He was a young lion seizing the prey.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And what a prey He captured!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It included the whole world, all the sinners, and even Satan, the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From seizing His prey Christ has gone up to the mountaintop, that is, to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that from His victory, He has ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians 4:8 says that when Christ ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ gained the victory; He put His hand upon Satan's neck.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hallelujah, He has put His hand upon the neck of His enemies!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the young lion, He has overcome all His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many chapters in the New Testament reveal how Christ came as a young lion, how He went to the cross to seize His prey, and how He ascended to the mountaintop in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ as the Lion Couching in Satisfaction</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>after Enjoying the Prey</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genesis 49:9 also says, "He couches, he lies down as a lion" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is also a couching lion, the lion couching in satisfaction after enjoying His prey.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After a lion has enjoyed his prey and has been satisfied, he couches; he lies down to rest in satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The figure of the couching lion in verse 9 describes Christ as the One enjoying His rest in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After gaining the victory and enjoying the prey, He was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, He is now resting in the heavens in His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This rest and satisfaction is the issue of Christ's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is no longer fighting; rather, He is couching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ as the Lioness</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Producing Cubs</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 9 Heb Christ is also likened to a lioness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a lioness, He has produced many cubs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all are Christ's cubs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a very real sense, the church is lion country, and everyone in the church is a baby lion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Have you ever realized that you are a lion cub?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we saw the situation from God's viewpoint, we would realize that in the eyes of God the church is a country of lions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Toward men we are lambs following the Lamb; but toward Satan we are lion cubs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although you may not have such a realization, Satan recognizes this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He knows that all the believers in the Lord's recovery are lion cubs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Frequently we need to tell Satan, "Satan, don't touch me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Don't you know that my family is the lion family?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is the young lion, the couching lion, and the reproducing lioness, and we are His lion cubs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the full victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why verse 8 says that Christ, typified by Judah, is to be praised and worshipped.</S>
