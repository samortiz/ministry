First, I would like to mention something about what the Lord's recovery has gone through in the past sixty-four years. Our beginning in the Lord's recovery was very difficult. This was because we were new and young, and Christianity was prevailing. Of course, the Lord was merciful to us. He gave us a heart to seek after Him, after His Word, after His truth, and after His way. By His mercy we were absolute in our desire to drop the traditional, unscriptural way of Christianity and simply take the Lord Himself, His gospel, and His Word. However, we did not clearly see the right way to carry out what the Lord had shown us concerning the church. We mostly went to the writings of the Brethren for help concerning the practice of the church life. As young men, we had no choice except to discerningly follow those writings. Later, we found that the practice of the Brethren was neither absolutely scriptural nor adequate to meet our need.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECOVERING THE PROPER CHRISTIAN MEETING</H2><P>Both Brother Nee and I came out from Christianity. Brother Nee's grandfather was a pastor, and my mother was a third generation Christian. We studied in Christian schools. By the Lord's mercy, we began to meet outside of Christianity to have the Lord's recovery. Although we had come out of Christianity, we realized that we still unintentionally maintained some parts of the practice of Christianity as a kind of unconscious tradition in our meetings.</P><P>According to the natural concept, a Christian meeting must be a meeting with a large congregation. However, according to the principle of Matthew 18:20, only two or three are required for a Christian meeting. Nearly all of the local churches began with a small number. In the early days of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, many churches began with not more than five saints. Spontaneously, these localities grew to a larger number.</P><P>Eventually in 1948, Brother Nee began to say that the Lord's Day morning meeting among us was not so good. He uttered his strong feeling definitely to us. He indicated strongly that we should stop the Lord's Day morning meetings and spend that time to preach the gospel (see Church Affairs&#151;chapter four). He told us that our way of meeting was altogether not according to the Scriptures. He pointed out to us that the most clear word in the New Testament concerning the way the believers should meet is in 1 Corinthians 14. He especially stressed verse 26, which says that when we come together, all of us should have something. He also pointed out that the proper Christian meeting should be fully in mutuality.</P><P>He said that the Lord's Day message meeting with one speaking and the rest listening was according to the "customs of the nations." In the Old Testament, God warned the children of Israel that when they entered the good land, they should not follow the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8; Lev. 18:3; Deut. 18:9&#151;NASB). Brother Nee compared all the denominations to the nations. The children of Israel followed the nations, but today we are following the denominations. To have one speaking and the rest listening on the Lord's Day morning is a custom of the fallen denominations. If we take this way, we are like the children of Israel who followed the customs of the nations, and this is serious in the Lord's eyes.</P><P>Brother Nee also said that it would be hard for us to change since we were accustomed to this traditional way of meeting. If we changed suddenly, it might result in a great loss. Thus, he proposed a brothers' meeting for the brothers and a sisters' meeting for the sisters. In these meetings he said that there should not be any assigned speaker. He made it clear that all of the saints should speak in mutuality. These meetings, however, did not succeed. Eventually, we were not able to practice the truth which Brother Nee saw in 1 Corinthians 14:26.</P><P>As our history progressed in the Lord's recovery, some situation of our meetings has gradually drifted back more to the same as that of Christianity. Even though we had renounced the traditional and unscriptural way of Christianity, we still carried with us some of Christianity's practice of meeting. Christianity is still prevailing among us as long as we continue the practice of having church meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. For the church life, the way of meeting is vital. How the church goes on depends upon how we meet. If we still meet according to the traditional way of Christianity, how can we say we have given up Christianity? We are still continuing in this unscriptural practice.</P><P>This traditional practice, the practice of the clergy and laity, results in hierarchy. We have said that we hate, despise, and condemn the clergy-laity system, but what has been the real situation among us in the past years? We have to admit that unconsciously the clergy-laity system has crept in among us. Spontaneously, hierarchy has also begun to exist among us, and the clergy-laity system has been increasing unintentionally among us. In nearly every locality, there has been one big speaker. Not much attention or regard was given to all the saints functioning in mutuality. In the meetings of the church, everyone expected to have a good speaker.</P><P>In 1984 I felt strongly that I should go back to Taiwan to have a new start for the Lord's recovery. I was clear that we needed a new start, and the way to have a new start among us was to change the system of our meetings. The new start had to be revolutionary in the sense of overthrowing the unscriptural and traditional way of meeting. I saw clearly that if we could overthrow this way of meeting, hierarchy would have no place among us. We must overthrow the way of meeting with a big congregation, and with one person speaking and the rest listening. This annuls the clergy-laity system. The proper way of meeting is a way that is full of mutuality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING HOME MEETINGS</H2><P>Furthermore, the practice of the saints in the early church was to meet in their homes (Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20). To gain the increase, we need to have the home meetings. The church has been dead, passive, and low in the rate of increase because we did not have the crucial way to gain people through the home meetings. We need to have meetings in the new believers' homes, in the homes of the ones we gain through our preaching of the gospel. If we can only gain people without setting up meetings in their homes, this will be a failure. The most successful way is to gain people's homes for home meetings. Meetings in the homes will work to the uttermost.</P><P>Seemingly, it was a risk to have such a change among us. But actually it was not a risk because we have the word of the Lord as a base for our practice. Acts tells us that when the church was initially established, the believers met from house to house. Meeting in homes as the Christian way of meeting together is fitting to God's New Testament economy. This way differs from the Judaic way of meeting in the synagogues (Acts 6:9). It became a continual and general practice in the churches (cf. Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Philem. 2). The three thousand that were saved on the day of Pentecost immediately began to meet from house to house.</P><P>To overthrow the old way of meeting is to make the so-called clergy jobless. Then the building of the clergy is torn down, and the producing of the clergy has no opportunity. If we mean business with the Lord in sincerity to take the new way, this will overthrow the clergy-laity system. Those of us who love the Lord and His recovery have to realize that our old way of meeting with one speaking and the rest listening was according to the traditional and unscriptural practice of Christianity. We said that we dropped Christianity and that we left Christianity, but we still brought some part of the practice of Christianity with us and continued to keep it. As long as we prefer to have big meetings with one speaking and the rest listening, we are a continuation of Christianity in some sense.</P><P>We cannot deny that many people have been brought to the Lord through the old way of meeting with big congregations. But there is another fact which no one can deny either, that is, that the old practice kills the functions of the members of Christ. The way of Christianity builds up hierarchy. It builds up the clergy and produces the laity. This way has both a credit side and a debit side. However, the failure on the debit side is much greater than any success on the credit side. Would we still take a way that causes us to suffer so much loss, the loss of the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ?</P><P>Brother Nee's eyes were opened long ago to see the truth concerning the church meetings in mutuality with all the saints functioning. But at that time, we were not so clear how to handle the situation. Today we need to have a change to the God-ordained way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>I realized that initially it might be a suffering to have such a change. Seemingly we may not make that much profit at the beginning, but we will lay a good foundation so that we can make an unlimited profit in the future. I have the full assurance that the God-ordained way, the biblical way (according to Acts 2:46, Acts 5:42, and 1 Corinthians 14) works. This new way is insured by God's Word and will not suffer loss eventually.</P><P>The number one thing in my heart since 1984 has been to overthrow the system of one man speaking and the rest listening. We need to drop that old way and pick up the God-ordained, scriptural, new way. We need to have an absolute change to meetings of mutuality and to the home meetings. The basic factor for our meetings is that we need to meet in our homes. This is in the Bible, and this is God's ordained way.</P><P>Many of us can testify that at the beginning of our church life experience, when we were meeting in the homes, we increased rather quickly. But once we began to concentrate our meeting life in the meeting hall, our rate of increase gradually declined. To have the home meetings is not an easy task. The way of having big congregations is somewhat easy, but to have home meetings in every believer's home is a difficult job. If we have the home meetings, we will receive the benefit. We all have to drop our old way and pick up the new way.</P><P>In the new way, we have to learn how to go to every believer's home to have a meeting in each home. This is not an easy work. On the one hand, to work for the Lord we have to go to the people who can be considered as producing soil. On the other hand, we have to learn to recover those who have backslidden. Where there is a will, there is a way. If we would set our will to visit people with much prayer, the Lord will honor our will because this is His will. We will experience the Lord's blessing if we cooperate with Him to visit others.</P><P>The elders and co-workers also need to learn how to use the positive ones among us who are desirous to serve and burdened to function. We need to visit people with these ones as helpers. Eventually, we can assign the whole burden of the home meetings to these helpers. Concerning these things, we are still in the laboratory. We are still in the experimental stage. We need many experiences in the lab. We need to find out the most prevailing way to build up a Christian meeting in each member's home if possible. We have to endeavor to do this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED OF MEETING HALLS<br>AND PERIODIC CONFERENCES</H2><P>We have to anticipate that as we cooperate with the Lord to carry out His ordained way, we will gain a substantial increase. This is why we need the meeting halls. When our number is low, we do not need a hall, but when we gain a certain amount of increase, it is good for all the saints to gather together. When we gain the proper increase, our meeting halls will become very useful. Regardless of how large a local church becomes, there is still the need for the whole church to come together periodically. Such a gathering will be a great stirring up and encouragement to the saints.</P><P>In the Lord's new move in the churches, we need the home meetings, the truth lessons, the Lord's table, the prayer meeting, and we also need big meetings periodically to gather all the new ones together. We need periodic conferences with all the new converts. For the new ones just to meet in homes to receive nourishment and to learn the truth in the group meetings will not be fully adequate to make them so living and equipped to bear more burden for the Lord. For the long run, they also need to be gathered together for a conference with all of the saints. This kind of gathering stirs up and encourages the saints. This opens the eyes of the seeking ones to see something further. Otherwise, they will remain in their homes, and they will not receive a broader view of the Lord's move.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING AND TEACHING THE TRUTH</H2><P>We also have to admit our failure in the teaching of the truth. The Lord has given us many truths, but not many of these truths have been imparted into the saints. We must change our way of teaching the truths. In 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul told Timothy, "The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also." Some may want to do the teaching by themselves, having no trust in others. We surely have to change. If someone in a local church has a deposit of the Lord's healthy words, he should train the faithful ones that they too may have a good deposit from the Lord and be competent to teach others. All of the saints should be those who are learning and teaching the truth. This is why we published the series of books entitled Truth Lessons. It is possible that these lessons can be used for a group meeting in the homes of the saints every week. Assigned teachers are not needed because each lesson is fully explained. We can read them and impress ourselves with the content.</P><P>All of us need to be absolute for the God-ordained way, totally abandoning the old way. If we try to "put our feet in two boats," we will end up in the water. We should determine which boat we want to be in&#151;the boat of the new way or the boat of the old way. The "new boat" works better. For all the saints to meet in their homes and for them to get into Truth Lessons week after week in the group meeings will be very fruitful. Then every family will be revived. The saints will be brought into function. They will work for the Lord by preaching the gospel to their relatives and their neighbors. When the saints are meeting in their homes every week according to the God-ordained way, each home can bring in at least one new one a year. It is even possible for each home to bring in six persons a year. We need to take this new way for the increase of the church.</P><P>All of the saints need to learn to teach the truth. They can learn the truth by getting into Truth Lessons. I composed these lessons to make every member of the church a teacher of the truth and a speaker of the truth. After getting into these lessons for half a year in a regular way, the saints will be equipped to speak. The saints can come together to read these lesson books. They can read one lesson a week. After a year, they can finish reading forty-eight lessons. This will be very fruitful for the church life. The God-ordained way will make all the members of the church functioning members.</P><P>The Lord has given us all the truths and has brought His recovery to the United States to be a center of His recovery. We need to give ourselves to see the truths of the Lord's recovery spread to the entire earth. All the dear Christians need the same truths. We have to go out to send them the truths also. We should not try to get them to come out of the denominations to join us. We are not for this. We are for the spreading of the truths that the Lord's people may be enlightened, nourished, and edified. We have to believe that the truth wins, and the Lord's words will do a marvelous job. This is the right way to spread the Lord's recovery without any sectarianism. Whether other Christians would come to meet with us or not is up to them. The local churches have to comprise all the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRODUCING OF FULL-TIMERS</H2><P>We should endeavor to have one out of twenty saints in our locality serve the Lord with all of their time. In this way nineteen saints can support one full-timer. The saints need to be helped by us to give for the sake of supporting full-timers for the Lord's move on this earth. We need the full-timers for the spread of the Lord's recovery. If the Lord had five thousand full-timers in His recovery today, the result would be marvelous. The United States is a strong country because it has a strong military. The full-time trainees should be trained to be such a strong army for the Lord.</P><P>We have the burden to train the full-timers in the truths. Every full-time trainee must become very knowledgeable of the truths. We want them to dive into the Recovery Version of the New Testament with the notes on the text and into the Life-study messages. They must have a proper knowledge of the divine truths. Then when they go out, they will have something to speak.</P><P>We also have the burden to help the trainees to grow absolutely in the divine life. Finally, they have to be built up in their character. They need to be trained to dress properly and to give people a good impression of their appearance. If we do not have a good appearance, who will listen to us or respect us? We must adjust ourselves. If a co-worker teaches the truth without a necktie, the people's confidence in him will be killed. The way we dress, cut our hair, and comb our hair will give us a proper appearance which can help gain people's regard and respect. In the past we were too loose and self-contented. Those who work for the Lord should dress in a way that is fitting in the Lord's work.</P><P>The trainees also need to be trained in how to speak to people. They need to learn how to present the truths as they have been expounded among us in the Recovery Version and in the Life-study messages. We do not need to invent new messages. We can present the messages which we have already published. We need to present the better things. We have the groceries of the truth among us, so there is no need to try to get new groceries.</P><P>If we all would be absolute to take the God-ordained way, and if we can produce one out of twenty full-timers in all the churches, the Lord's recovery will increase and spread in a marvelous way. The old way should be dropped. We should change our way. Our way in the past was too loose and too sloppy. We have been self-contented. We need to be desperate to take the Lord's ordained way for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</P><P>In our preaching of the gospel, we should abandon the system of having large gospel meetings with one speaking and the rest listening. Instead, we should invest our prayer, time, and energy to go out to visit people in our community and on our campuses. The full-timers especially need to spend their time to visit people with the gospel. This should also be a priority with all of the elders.</P><P>We have the burden in the full-time training to train the young people not only to preach the gospel but also to teach the truth. We need to learn how to convince people with the higher truths. Actually, the teaching of the truths which the Lord has committed to us is included in the preaching of the gospel. Many wonderful truths have been given to us. The world is starving for these truths. This is why those who are full-timers must become very knowledgeable of the truths and must accumulate the experience in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING IN ONE ACCORD</H2><P>All of us need to be one with the Lord in the life-pulse of His new move. For the Lord's new move, all of the churches need to be in one accord. In the past, we lost the one accord, but we must endeavor to recover and keep it. We also must teach the same thing in all the churches in every country throughout the earth. There should be no different trumpeting or different voicing among us. We should all voice the same thing, trumpet the same thing, and teach the same thing. We need to be one in teaching (1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; 16:1; Acts 2:42; Rom. 16:17; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3; Eph. 4:13-14).</P><P>All of the churches should also be one in practice (1 Cor. 11:16; 14:33b-34). If the churches are not the same in practice, this will damage the one accord. If we train the full-timers in the God-ordained way, and they return to churches who practice differently, this could cause problems. We will be contradicting ourselves. I hope that all the trainees who return to their churches will be so useful because we are all practicing the same way.</P><P>In the early days of the church life, the churches were the same in practice. When Paul went to Jerusalem, however, he saw something different (Acts 21:20; see James 2:10 and note 1 in the Recovery Version). Eventually, the Lord wiped out that different thing in Jerusalem. In the past we suffered much loss because of our different ways to practice the church life.</P><P>Furthermore, we should drop the thought of separate regions among us. Perhaps a brother is raised up in a certain area. When he moves to another area, there should not be any problem, but there have been problems in the past. We have to drop our way of having separate regions in the Lord's work. It is even good for some who have been in a certain area for a long time to move to another area. In the Lord's recovery, there should only be one work in one move with one ministry for the building up of the one Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAKING THE LORD'S PRESENT MOVE CLEAR<br>TO ALL THE SAINTS</H2><P>All of the elders and co-workers need to work hard with much prayer to make the Lord's move today clear to all the saints. The present move of the Lord needs all of us to be given to the Lord. Our entire being and all that we have should be fully consecrated to Him. In the Lord's move, there is the need of persons and material supply. If we help the saints realize the Lord's present move, there will be no problem. But if the saints do not receive the adequate education to make them knowledgeable of the Lord's present move, we may suffer some loss. This means we may be short in the financial supply. This is why we need to spend some time in our locality, perhaps one or two months, to fellowship with the saints concerning the Lord's move today and the need in this move for the proper supply of persons and finances. We all have to consecrate ourselves with all that we have to the Lord again.</P><P>We must also help the saints concerning how they should give. They should give part of their offering to the church in their locality for the monthly local expenses. They should also give part of their offering for the support of the full-timers. This is based upon nineteen of the saints helping to support one full-timer. We have to endeavor to do this so that the Lord can carry out His desire.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ENDEAVORING TO CARRY OUT<br>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H1><P>In this chapter I would like to present the contrast between the practice of the church life as seen in the record of the New Testament and what is seen in Christianity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOD-ORDAINED, SCRIPTURAL WAY<br>TO PRACTICE THE CHURCH LIFE</H2><P>I would like to point out three verses that are very crucial. Acts 2:46 tells us that the early Christians broke bread from house to house. The Greek text also can mean that they broke bread "according to their homes." Acts 5:42 tells us that the early apostles went from house to house to do two things: to preach and to teach Christ as the gospel. Their gospel was not a theology nor mere doctrine. Their gospel was a living person, the very Christ, whom the Jewish religion at that time opposed to the uttermost. They preached this opposed One as the gospel and they also taught. These two verses are critical. Another crucial verse is 1 Corinthians 14:26. This verse tells us that when the church comes together, each one should have something. This one has a psalm, another one has a teaching, another one has a revelation, etc.</P><P>By these three verses, we can see the real situation and the real condition of the believers' meetings in the early days of the church. This situation and condition cannot be seen in today's Christianity. Even we ourselves are very short of this God-ordained way to practice the church life. First, the early believers practiced the church life according to their homes. This means that the church life at that time was in the believers' homes. Second, when the whole church came together, it was not a meeting in which one person spoke and the rest listened. Their church meetings were full of mutuality. Each one should have something of the Lord to share with the others for the building up of the church. Such meetings of mutuality cannot be seen in today's Christianity, and it is hard to see them prevailing among us.</P><P>This is why by October of 1984, I was forced to reconsider what is in the Bible, what we are doing, and what we see in today's Christianity. My eyes were once more enlightened to see God's ordained way to build up the Body of Christ. Surely Christianity has deviated from this way. We also have deviated to a certain extent because we have not fully practiced what is recorded in the holy Word. Thus, I was strong to make a decision that we needed to have a great change, a revolutionary change.</P><P>The present practice of Christianity leads to hierarchy, organization, and clergy, producing many so-called laymen. Hierarchy, organization, and clergy are the factors that have killed and even cut Christ's Body into pieces. Doctrinal factors have not done the damage that these three things have done. These three things mainly depend on the present practice of Christianity. If the present practice of Christianity is torn down, hierarchy falls apart, organization is gone, and the practice of clergy is buried.</P><P>Many years ago our brother, Watchman Nee, saw this clearly. I surely knew where he was. He had many talks with me. Actually, I learned these things through him. Since the time that Brother Nee shared these things, however, the Lord's recovery has gradually and unintentionally drifted back in certain respects to the practice of Christianity. It seems that hierarchy, organization, and clergy, in principle, have begun to exist among us secretly. The way to uproot hierarchy, organization, and clergy is to fully abandon the practice of Christianity.</P><P>I think that the leading ones in all the different localities should have realized that the real situation among us has drifted back, to some extent, from the living Body of Christ to hierarchy, organization, and clergy. The way to pull down hierarchy, organization, and clergy is to kill the system of having big meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. Then there will be no means to build up hierarchy. If we pull down this old system of meeting and meet according to homes, hierarchy will be gone.</P><P>Some may argue by saying that if we have many home meetings, the church will be full of confusion. My response is that it all depends upon how we have the home meetings. The Bible shows us that the home meetings are not for doctrines or organization, but for preaching Christ and teaching Christ. The pattern in the New Testament reveals that in the home meetings they remembered the Lord by breaking bread, they preached Christ, and they taught what Christ did and is still doing. They ministered Christ to people. If we do this, there will be no standing and no ground for the enemy to come in to cause confusion.</P><P>In order to fully enter into the scriptural practice of the church life, the way ahead of us is very long. We are acquainted with the way to hold big meetings. We were raised up in this way, and this way has become a part of the "tissue" and the "cells" of our being. It is somewhat easy for people to establish a so-called church. They can build or rent a place to meet, collect some people together, raise funds, and hire someone to speak to them. But we must labor to learn the God-ordained, scriptural way to practice the church life because it is really new to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VISITING PEOPLE WITH THE HIGH GOSPEL</H2><P>It is new for us to go out to visit people with the gospel. The way that we knock on people's doors in the community is new. The Mormons knock on doors, but they bring their heresy with them. What can they give people? They have no truth, no life, and no light. But we visit people with truth, life, and light. The booklet entitled The Mystery of Human Life is full of truth, life, and light. The high gospel in this booklet can reach the thoughtful people.</P><P>Most of the Chinese people are very logical and philosophical. We have found that the truth in the The Mystery of Human Life can reach these people. Confucius taught about human life, but he did not give the answer to the meaning of human life. Human life is a mystery. The answer to the meaning of human life is not in any philosophical book; it is in the Holy Bible.</P><P>One of the first things The Mystery of Human Life speaks of is that man was created by God according to God's image to receive God and contain God. The three circles representing the spirit, soul, and body are also in this booklet. It says that God desires to come into man's spirit and that man's spirit is for him to contain God. Thousands have been brought to the Lord through this small booklet.</P><P>Immediately after the new ones are baptized, home meetings should be set up in their home. Following the preaching of the gospel to lead them to believe and be baptized, we must teach them the truth and help them to grow in life. We must minister Christ to them.</P><P>Today in the local churches, by the Lord's mercy, we have the high gospel and much truth and life. Regretfully, however, we have been limited by our unscriptural practice. We have much cargo of truth and life, but we do not have the adequate way to spread it. This is because in the past we took the wrong way, the easy way. In some respects we have been drifting back to the practice of Christianity, leaving our cargo in storage. Since 1974 we have published many books, but these books mostly remain on our bookshelves. We do not use them. By October of 1984, I was clear that our practice had to be revolutionized. The Lord has given us many truths and much life, but not many would go out to spread these truths and to minister the very Christ as life to others.</P><P>We have to take the way which is on the Lord's heart. We must follow Him. He did not remain in the heavens, but He came down to visit man. He visited Zaccheus in his home (Luke 19:5-7). He went to visit the Samaritan woman (John 4:4-7). The Lord carried out His ministry all the time by visiting people. He visited Martha and Mary's home (Luke 10:38-39) and the house of Simon the leper (Matt. 26:6). He charged His disciples to go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation (Mark 16:15). He also charged them to go and disciple the nations (Matt. 28:19). In Acts 1:8 He told them that they would be His witnesses starting from Jerusalem, then Judea, then Samaria, and then to the uttermost part of the earth.</P><P>First, we have to go to our "Jerusalem." In other words, we need to go to those close to us, that is, our relatives, neighbors, friends, colleagues, and classmates. Instead of going to visit people with the gospel, however, we have picked up much of Christianity's way. We invite the sinners to come to us, instead of our going to them. The way that we have taken to meet and to serve in the past, in many respects, has been wrong. We must take the God-ordained, organic, scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>Recently I told some of the brothers that I was like Gideon looking for the three hundred to be in one accord with me for the Lord's move (Judg. 7:7). I only care for one thing&#151;to carry out what the Lord has charged us to do. We all need to rise up and put everything of the unscriptural practice of Christianity under our feet. The number one thing we should do in these days is to visit people in their homes. This is to follow the pattern of the Lord Jesus. We must go to visit people. We do not necessarily need to go to Africa or Mongolia. We can go next door to our neighbor. We can go to the homes of our relatives to bring the living Christ to them. We have the high gospel, the rich truth, and the wonderful life of Christ to minister to people.</P><P>After setting up home meetings with the new believers, we have to teach them the truth. We can use appropriate portions of our publications for this purpose. Now is the time for us to go out and send the truth to people's homes. Then the ones in these homes will be brought into functioning. They will talk about the divine truths. We need to impress the new ones that they can practice the church life in their homes.</P><P>I want to take the new way, the God-ordained way. In the new way, we have to be raised up to spread the gospel by visiting people. The elders need to forget about spending much of their time to work for the church at a desk in their office. They should go out to preach the gospel and baptize people. One leading brother told me that in the past twenty years he had not brought one person to Christ. Within a short time after coming back from the full-time training in Taiwan, however, he baptized seventeen people. Another brother who went to Taiwan knocked on a particular door, and the gentleman said that he was not interested. Then this brother went to the back of the house and knocked on the kitchen door. The gentleman said again that he was not interested, and he told the brother that he could not come in. Then the brother said, "Okay, I won't come in. You come out." This brother had the authority of Christ. That gentleman came out, and the brother read a few pages of The Mystery of Human Life with him. Then that man received the Lord, and was baptized in his bathtub.</P><P>These experiences show that we need to forget about the traditional way of Christianity and come back to the scriptural way. Christianity has misled us and given us the wrong impression. We have received a wrong understanding of the Lord's move. We do not need to wait to form a mission, raise up funds, and send missionaries to go to Africa. We can be missionaries to our neighbors right away. We need to budget our time to visit people with the gospel. We need to have a revolutionized church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTIZING PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING<br>THEIR BELIEVING IN THE LORD</H2><P>We should baptize someone, if possible, immediately after he believes in the Lord. The Bible does not tell us that a person has to wait to be baptized after he believes. We do not need to wait so that we can baptize people in the baptistry of the meeting hall. Acts 8 shows us that the Ethiopian eunuch was baptized by Philip immediately after believing in the Lord (vv. 35-39). The Philippian jailor was baptized by Paul and Silas immediately after he believed. Acts 16:33b and 34a say, "He was baptized immediately, he and all his household. And he brought them up into his house...." After his baptism, the jailor brought Paul and Silas "up" into his house. This indicates that this must have been done downstairs in the bathing pool at the place where they were (see note 1 of verse 33&#151;Recovery Version). When we practiced this, many people were shocked, but this is recorded in the Bible. The Bible shows us that baptism is practiced immediately after someone believes in the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DESPERATE FOR THE LORD'S INCREASE</H2><P>We need to reconsider our situation. The elders should take the lead to visit people with the gospel. Then meetings should be set up in the homes of the newly baptized ones. We need to teach them the truth and help them to grow in life and to know Christ in an experiential way. Eventually, they will be perfected to do what we do. We all have to be revolutionized to learn something new. We should not practice the church life in the old way. We need to pick up the new way, beginning with preaching the gospel by visiting people.</P><P>The number one thing in preaching the gospel is that we need to be desperate to gain new ones for the Lord's increase. We also have to exercise our faith to apply the Lord's authority, standing on Matthew 28:18-19, where the Lord said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations." When we go out to preach the gospel we should pray, "Lord, I stand on this word. Your authority is mine. I go with Your authority." When we are sharing the gospel with people, we should not ask them if they would like to receive the Lord and be baptized. If we do this, they will say "no" most of the time. Instead, we need to exercise the Lord's authority and direct them to believe and be baptized.</P><P>Before we go out to preach the gospel, we must be cleared up with the Lord. We must practice making a thorough confession of our failures, sinfulness, and wrongdoings so that we can receive the filling of the Holy Spirit. Then we will not go empty and alone. Instead, we will go to people filled with the Spirit.</P><P>I hope that from now on the leading ones in the churches would take the lead to preach the gospel by visiting people. Going out to visit people is the most effective way to spread the gospel for the kingdom of God. Those of us who go out for the spread of the gospel must be strict with ourselves. Any looseness can bring in death. We must be serious, not only before man but also before God's enemy. We are not here for doctrines. We are here for the Lord Christ, and we want to give Him a way to come back.</P><P>Recent statistics show that over the last twenty-two years, from 1964 to 1986, the membership of the Roman Catholic Church has increased by only .62 percent annually while that of the Southern Baptist denomination has increased by only 1.38 percent annually. A recent article said that since the mid sixties, the mainline denominations have collectively lost more than 4,778,000 members. These statistics show us that the traditional, unscriptural way of preaching the gospel does not work well over the long run.</P><P>We have to consider the situation in our locality. How much has the church in our locality increased over the years? Where is the increase? We all need to wake up. We need to be wise and sober. We need the increase, and the Lord Jesus needs the increase. Many people have been saved through big gospel campaigns throughout the years, but where are these ones today? Christianity is full of activities, but where is the remaining increase? Where is the real result?</P><P>We must take the God-ordained way to spread the gospel. We should be afraid of the poverty of increase in our locality. We need to wake up and endeavor to gain people for the Lord's kingdom. All of us have to give an account at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). We should go first to our "Jerusalem." Then we should stir up the seeking ones in our locality to go out to visit people with the gospel.</P><P>In the past we were wasting our time by taking an unscriptural way. Because of this, we have been delaying the Lord's coming back. Are we satisfied with our present situation and condition? Do we think that we will be approved by the Lord when He comes? We all need to be desperate to bear fruit for the Father's glorification (John 15:8).</P><P>I also hope that one out of twenty in every church would be a full-timer. The full-timers should use their time to visit people for the spread of the gospel. They can also use their time to learn the truths and to pray. I believe that the issue of this will be marvelous. I hope that one out of twenty can serve the Lord full-time and that one out of four in the churches can be raised up to preach the gospel regularly in the God-ordained way. If this can be realized, I believe that we can have a solid increase of one hundred percent yearly. We can gain the solid increase, but we have to labor desperately, not in a loose way.</P><P>If all the Christians on earth would do this, I believe that within one or two years the entire earth would be "Christianized." We all need to wake up. We should forget about the fa&#231;ade of having big meetings with a good speaker. A number of us have been doing this for years, but what has been the result? Why would we not change our way? We should not waste our time and delay the Lord's coming back.</P><P>I have seen a vision, and I believe it will come to pass that the church life in all the cities will be practiced in many homes. Regularly, the church life will be going on in all the homes, and the entire church can also come together with everyone functioning. That will be wonderful. We have to realize that every home is a station for the Lord. The Lord can do many things through a home as His station. Every home can be a station of the gospel, a station of the truth, a station of life, and a station of the church life. The members of this home can be preachers of the gospel. We need to reconsider our way. We should go back to our localities to practice preaching the gospel according to the God-ordained way, and then we should train the faithful ones who have the way and the burden.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CARRYING OUT THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>BY A REVIVED LIFE</H1><P>In this chapter we want to fellowship more concerning how to carry out the God-ordained way. First, I want to point out some crucial items of revelation which were released in the summer training of 1987.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY TO PRACTICE<br>THE NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</H2><P>In the summer training of 1987, I shared nineteen messages which are contained in the book entitled The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy. A number of these messages are crucial in revelation. The first chapter of this book is concerning the divine economy. In that chapter there is one point which I never released in the previous years of my ministry. That point is concerning the completion of Christ. The record of the completion of Christ is in the four Gospels. Then in the Acts, this completed Christ was propagated. God's Christ is eternally perfect, but such an eternally perfect Christ needed to be completed. Today our Savior is the completed Christ. He has been completed in incarnation, in human living, in crucifixion, in resurrection, in becoming the essential Spirit of life, in ascension, and in becoming the economical Spirit of power.</P><P>I also consider the last three chapters of this book to be very critical. These three chapters are entitled "The Apostles' Teaching and Fellowship," "The New Testament Ministry and Ministers," and "The Leadership in the New Testament Ministry and among the New Testament Ministers." According to the New Testament record, the leadership is in the apostles' teaching (Acts 2:42). In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul exhorted Timothy to remain in Ephesus that he might charge certain ones not to teach different things from God's economy. First Timothy shows us that there was some leadership that charged people to teach the proper thing. This shows that the proper leadership is in the apostles' teaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE APPLICATION OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>BY A REVIVED LIFE</H2><P>In this chapter I would like to fellowship concerning the application of the God-ordained way, the biblical way, the new way. To know this way outwardly is not that difficult, but to apply the biblical way to meet and to serve is not so simple. This biblical way includes four things: (1) the preaching of the gospel by visiting people to get people saved for Christ (Matt. 28:19; Mark 16:15); (2) having home meetings set up in the new ones' homes for nourishing and cherishing them that they may grow in life (John 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2); (3) having group meetings to group the new ones together for perfecting (Heb. 10:24-25; Eph. 4:12-13); and (4) prophesying, speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord, in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23-24, 31, 39a). None of these four items is easy. Even the first step of visiting people to get them saved is not easy.</P><P>To visit people for the preaching of the gospel, we must be revived persons. We must be stirred up in our spirit. We must be praying persons who pray ourselves into our spirit. Then when we are in the light, we can make a thorough confession of all our sinfulness, defects, and failures. For the entire day we have to walk in the spirit and we have to live Christ. We also must learn to speak Christ all day long to anybody. Then this will qualify us to be the right persons to go out, not merely with a doctrinal gospel but with the living person of Christ.</P><P>The Lord said that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth; then He charged the disciples to go and disciple the nations (Matt. 28:18-19). This is to go with the Christ who has all the authority. We must be filled with the Spirit, so that we can speak at any time with boldness. That boldness is a strong sign that we are experiencing the outpoured Spirit.</P><P>In order to be prevailing in the gospel, we must be people who live a revived life, an overcoming life. As regenerated persons, we need to be filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly. Then when we go to visit people, we go with Christ as the Spirit. Christ is not only our power but also our authority. When we speak to people, Christ speaks in our speaking. When we are filled with the Spirit, we have the boldness and the utterance. We can speak the same word in two ways. One way is by ourselves. The other way is to speak with Christ. This makes a great difference.</P><P>Some saints have asked how a person could be regenerated within fifteen minutes. But I would ask how much time is needed for a person to be regenerated. Many years ago there was a Norwegian missionary in China who was very powerful and prevailing in preaching regeneration. Many people were regenerated through her preaching. After her message, she would go to the entrance to meet people as they left and check with them one by one as to whether or not they had been regenerated. Even many pastors at that time were not regenerated.</P><P>Once she was preaching in a certain denomination where the pastor was an unregenerated opium smuggler. After her message she greeted this pastor at the entrance and asked him whether or not he had been regenerated. He said that he had, but this missionary replied that by the tone of his voice and by the expression on his face, she knew that he had not truly been regenerated. He was insulted by having such a word spoken to him in the presence of the members of his congregation. When he went back home, filled with hatred for this Norwegian missionary, he plotted to kill her. As he was making his evil plans, the Holy Spirit said to him, "See how evil you are!" The Holy Spirit worked upon him; he repented with tears and even rolled on the floor as he made his confession to the Lord.</P><P>His experience and the experience of many others, in accordance with the truth of the Scriptures, show that regeneration is instantaneous. But to help people experience regeneration, we need the Spirit. If we go out by ourselves and in ourselves, we may talk fluently to someone for a long time with no result. People may be convinced by us and still not be regenerated. We need to get ourselves prepared with the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit. When we go in this way, others will be regenerated. Whether or not others get regenerated depends upon what kind of persons we are when we go out.</P><P>To take an easy way in the Lord's present move does not work. Even the first item, the preaching of the gospel, is not an easy thing. It requires us to live a victorious life. By what way can we live such a life? There is no other way except by contacting the Lord. First, we must enjoy Him every morning. We have to spend a little time every morning to be with the Lord, to enjoy the Lord. Living a revived life enables us to bring others to the Lord so that they can be regenerated.</P><P>Many years ago, the inner-life people made being regenerated too difficult. Regeneration is instantaneous. D.L. Moody said that regeneration is the biggest miracle. It is a great miracle that a sinner can be made a son of God in an instant. Regeneration and being filled with the Spirit essentially and economically are very normal, but they are also miraculous to the uttermost. They are miraculous normalities. In the winter training of 1987, I gave a message on the miraculous normality in God's New Testament economy (see The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ&#151;chapter thirteen). Whatever has been bequeathed to us in God's New Testament economy is very normal in our experience. This is because everything is ready. The very Christ has been completed. Now He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and He is everywhere. He is even in our mouth and in our heart (Rom. 10:8&#151;see note 1, Recovery Version). We just need to call, "O Lord Jesus," and we get Him.</P><P>We may not have much time in the morning, but at least we can set apart ten minutes to spend with the Lord. We can spend these ten minutes to say, "O Lord Jesus," and we can turn to His Word to enjoy Him. The heavenly manna has been made available to us, and we just need to take it. The leading ones in the churches must learn and be burdened to be revived by the Lord every morning, and they have to help the other brothers and sisters to practice this. Whoever practices this will become living and even victorious. They will be eager to speak Christ to their relatives, acquaintances, colleagues, and classmates. They will also anticipate meeting in the evening with their family and with other Christians. When they meet, they will have something to say. They will have something living to render to the meeting. The key point is that we need to have a revived life, a victorious life.</P><P>It is not just a matter of changing our way outwardly to the new way. This is like changing the coffin of a dead body. The new way is to raise up the dead ones to be the living ones. The new way is altogether not a formal thing. This is why visiting people requires us to pay a big price. We have to lose our face and sacrifice our time. We have to suffer people's rejection of us. I hope that all of the saints can be brought into the top way of preaching the gospel, the way of visiting people. No other way is as effective or as prevailing.</P><P>We also need to endeavor to set up home meetings with the newly saved ones. This requires much labor. The home meetings test us to the uttermost. What we are, how much we have, and how much we can do will be tested by the home meetings. Having home meetings is not a simple matter of reading a few verses from the Bible or a passage from the Life-studies or Life Lessons with the new ones. The success of the home meetings depends upon who we are. Can we enliven people? This depends upon what kind of persons we are with the Lord. The new way is not just a way. It is actually a proper life, a revived life. The new way requires us to have a permanent revival day by day.</P><P>The new ones should also be grouped together for group meetings. In the old way of having group meetings, the attendants merely took turns reading through something from the Word and the ministry. Many became disappointed and dropped this kind of meeting. One brother told us that a certain denomination broke up into small groups, and this brother's father was assigned to be a leader of a certain group. When these ones came together in the group, however, everyone was quiet. No one would speak. Eventually, the pastor of this denomination gave up these small groups, thinking that they did not work. It is easy for everyone to attend a so-called Sunday service to listen to a pastor speak, but it is difficult to practice group meetings in which all the attendants function organically.</P><P>This shows that practicing the church life is not simply a matter of changing our way. It is a matter of changing our life. We must be persons who are really living in our spirit, walking in Christ, and living Him. Some may feel that this is too demanding, but the things of life are demanding. God can do so much for us, but He cannot eat, drink, or breathe for us. We have to exercise to eat, drink, and breathe. We must help the saints realize that they need to exercise to be brought into the enjoyment of the Lord. They have to contact Him.</P><P>The Lord is rich to all who call upon Him (Rom. 10:12). This does not mean that the Lord is rich to everyone. He is rich to that one who calls upon Him. The first thing that we should do in the morning is to enjoy Him. Then we should enjoy Him continually throughout the entire day. The Lord is real, true, and faithful. He never fails anyone who seeks after Him, who calls on Him. We must help ourselves and help the saints to contact the Lord, to call on Him. This will change our lives. This will make us powerful to touch people. When revived people come together to meet as a group, they will all have something to say. They will have a group meeting that is living, fresh, and new.</P><P>The new ones also need to be brought into the full realization of the proper church life. We must labor to bring the new ones into the larger meetings of the church and help them to know the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22b-23). Eventually, the new ones need to be led into prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRINGING THE CHURCH INTO THE PRACTICE<br>OF THE BIBLICAL WAY</H2><P>To try to bring the church into the practice of the biblical way too quickly will not work. I spent three years in Taipei to help the church there make the transition into the God-ordained way. During this time they maintained the Lord's Day morning message meeting because the saints had to be adequately prepared to meet in another way. Time was needed to bring them up to the proper standard. I used the illustration of some people who need to be brought down from the fifth floor of a building. You cannot ask them to jump down. If they do, they will die. You have to do something to help them walk down from the fifth floor to the first floor. We need to gradually and positively bring the saints into the God-ordained way of meeting, with all speaking in mutuality, for the building up of the church.</P><P>Brother Nee spoke twice concerning the church meetings in mutuality. One portion is in The Normal Christian Church Life (see chapter nine, pp. 191-218). The messages in this book were first given in 1937. The other portion concerning the God-ordained way to meet is in Church Affairs (see chapter four, pp. 67-90). The messages in this book were given in 1948. In Church Affairs there are three crucial points concerning the Lord's Day morning message meeting. The first is that the Lord's Day morning message meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening is according to "the customs of the nations." This is referred to in the Old Testament and includes idol worship (2 Kings 17:8&#151;NASB). Second, Brother Nee said that this kind of meeting was altogether a waste. Third, he said that such a meeting was not worthwhile to maintain.</P><P>Brother Nee saw this many years ago, and I was there when he released this word. He told us that this way of meeting was a very strong habit which was hard to remove. He said that we all had to push together until this unscriptural way was pushed aside. He pointed out, though, that it is difficult to get something to replace the Lord's Day morning message meeting. This may be likened to endeavoring to change from an old way of cooking to a new way. If no one knows how to cook in the new way, the old way of cooking cannot be stopped suddenly. Then everyone will starve. For this reason, I did not agree that we would completely stop the Lord's Day morning message meeting in Taipei. We did this when the saints were prepared for it. I am sharing this to help us realize that we should not take the God-ordained way so easily and so fast.</P><P>If we mean business with the Lord for His recovery, we have to remember that the God-ordained way to meet is a crucial item which has not yet been recovered. First Corinthians 14:26 says, "What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up." Where can we see that this verse has been fulfilled? Even with the Brethren, a century ago, this was not fully recovered. Where can we see the fulfillment of Hebrews 10:25, which says, "Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near"? These two verses are the Lord's words in His holy revelation. In Matthew 24:35 the Lord said, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away." Whatever the Lord has spoken, sooner or later, will be fulfilled. I have the full assurance that the Lord's words in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 will be fulfilled. If He does not do it in our time, He will do it in the future.</P><P>God promised Adam that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15), and He waited four thousand years to fulfill this promise. About two thousand years after this promise to Adam, God promised Abraham that through his seed, all the nations of the earth would be blessed (22:18). The birth of Jesus was the fulfillment of these two promises. He was the Triune God incarnated. He came to fulfill His promise. Thus far, He has been waiting for almost two thousand years for the complete fulfillment of all of His words in the New Testament. To the Lord, however, a thousand years is as one day (2 Pet. 3:8).</P><P>Since the time of Martin Luther, the Lord has brought His people through many recoveries. According to my knowledge, the experience of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 may be one of the final things that needs to be recovered. Brother Nee stressed this so much, but he did not have the opportunity to see this come to pass. He shared his burden concerning the church meeting of mutuality first in 1937 and a second time in 1948. In the following year, 1949, mainland China was lost to the Communists. In 1952 he was put into prison by them, so there was no opportunity for him to see the Lord's recovery of 1 Corinthians 14:26. I feel that I owe him something. Even for his sake, I need to labor to see this truth, which he stressed so much, realized among us.</P><P>I have been serving the Lord in His ministry for exactly fifty-five years. I began to practice the church life in my home in 1932. By 1984, fifty-two years later, I realized that I must do something for the Lord to see the churches brought into His ordained way. I have a burden to carry this out at any risk. I have not been attacked by the enemy at any time in my entire life as I have at this time, but by His mercy I am standing here. I only care for God's burden. Whether I could see His present burden come to pass or not, only He knows. I only care for one thing&#151;I have to finish my course; I have to discharge my burden.</P><P>The recovery of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 is a great thing. I only care for this burden. If I could not speak to all the saints on this earth, at least I could speak to a part of them. I must discharge my burden. I desire to sacrifice everything for this burden, even my life. I do not care for my life. I only care for this burden. There is a Chinese proverb which says, "I will do it to the uttermost until I die." This is my feeling.</P><P>If we have the burden to take this way, we should simply do it ourselves. We should not criticize others or look down on others who do not take this way. On the other hand, those who do not feel to take this way should not criticize those who do. We all are saints in the Lord's recovery. From the very beginning of my fellowship concerning the new way, I did not expect all of the saints in the churches to pick up the burden to preach the gospel by visiting people. But if we mean business with the Lord, we must try our best to build up in the church a habit of going out to reach people, a habit of preaching the gospel by visiting people. I hope that all of the churches would endeavor to pick up this burden to build up such a habit. It would be wonderful if one-fourth of the saints could be raised up to carry out this burden. Then we will gain a consistent yearly increase.</P><P>We must help the saints to be revived. By 1984 my feeling was that all the churches had become somewhat dormant. We lost our impact and our morale. What we had by 1984 was a routine way to meet, a routine way to work, and a routine way to speak. We were practicing the church life in a routine way. Where was the living burden? Where was the burning among us? It was lost.</P><P>We need to pick up the burden to practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, but I also advise all the churches not to do this in a fast way. I want to encourage us, though, to endeavor to enter into the reality of the Lord's biblical way. We must get ourselves revived to live a victorious life, and we need to help the saints to live the same life.</P><P>I hope that we could all be in one accord for the Lord's present move. We cannot organize the one accord. The one accord comes out of our spirit. We must endeavor to do everything we can to keep the one accord among us for the sake of the Lord's recovery. We should not do anything that would damage this one accord. We must be one with the church where we are according to what the church there feels it must practice presently. We must go on gradually and positively with the Lord until we fully enter into the reality of His ordained way.</P><P>I would again like to remind us that we must live a revived life. We must live a victorious life. We must learn to do things, not according to our preference but according to the spirit. In the spirit we love each other, sympathize with each other, and forgive each other. In this way the one accord can be produced and maintained among us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S ADMINISTRATION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>God's administration on this earth is very much related to the church's administration. If we are going to see God's administration on this earth, we have to see the administration of the church. To study this matter, we must go back to the very beginning of God's move among man in the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Kingdom of Priests and a Holy Nation</H2><P>In the book of Genesis since the fall of Adam, God moved on this earth among His chosen people. Through His move in the book of Genesis, God gained some important persons and eventually He gained the house of Israel. The crucial persons that He gained were Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph. Through Jacob with Joseph, God gained the house of Israel as a small group of people, but in that house we cannot see much of God's administration. We cannot see much of God's administration until we come to the time of Moses recorded in Exodus.</P><P>In Exodus 19 at Mount Sinai the Lord told the children of Israel that He wanted them to be a "kingdom of priests" and a "holy nation" (v. 6). The nation of Israel probably had over two million people by that time. The children of Israel were not saved from Egypt individually. They were saved corporately as an entire race of people. They did not come out of Egypt one by one as individuals, but they came out as a corporate people, even as a nation and a kingdom. When they came to Sinai, God called them a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. In this kingdom at Mount Sinai, God's administration among His people on this earth began.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Government by His Instant Speaking<br>plus His Constant, Written Word<br>through Some Agents</H2><P>God's administration was neither an autocracy by a dictator nor a democracy of the people. God's administration among the children of Israel was a theocracy, indicating that God Himself came to govern, to rule, to administrate the people of God directly yet through some agents. Among the children of Israel, these agents were the priests and the elders working together for God's theocracy. The priests were the ones who received God's word, God's speaking, God's instructions. God's speaking, His constant and instant speaking, was the living constitution of the children of Israel. Until the law was given, there was no constant speaking of God, but there was always His instant speaking. The law was the constant speaking of God. The law, like the United States Constitution, may be considered as the first written constitution of God's people written by God Himself. The Old Testament, however, shows us that the written constitution of God by itself was not adequate. There was still the need of God's instant constitution, His instant speaking. God's instant speaking always goes along with His written Word. The theocracy among the nation of Israel was a government according to God's constant speaking as written in the law or God's instant speaking as revealed through the breastplate of the high priest by means of the Urim and the Thummim (Exo. 28:30; Lev. 8:8; Num. 27:21; Deut. 33:8; 1 Sam. 28:6; Ezra 2:63; Neh. 7:65).</P><P>The very crucial part in God's government was God's instant speaking through the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate of the high priest. Among the people of Israel, there were the elders on the one hand and the priests on the other hand. Although the Scripture does not clearly indicate how the elders were produced, it does tell us how the priests were produced. God chose the entire nation of Israel to be a kingdom of priests. He intended for every male Israelite to be a priest. But the children of Israel fell and failed to arrive at God's purpose. Thus, God turned His choosing of the entire nation of Israel as priests to a family, the house of Aaron. The house of Aaron became a house of priests to replace the nation of priests. Aaron as the father was appointed by God to be the high priest and all his sons became the priests (Exo. 28:1). This was the way the priests were produced in the Old Testament.</P><P>Among the priests was the high priest with his priestly garments. The most important part of these garments was the breastplate on the ephod (Exo. 28:15-30). On the breastplate were twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel (vv. 17-21). I read an article years ago concerning the Urim and the Thummim written by a Hebrew scholar. According to this article, the twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel were composed of eighteen of the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The remaining four letters were put on a piece called the Thummim. The word Thummim indicates perfection or completion. Thus, on the breastplate with the additional piece called the Thummim, all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be found.</P><P>Furthermore, according to this article, the Urim, which means light, was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate underneath the twelve stones. Normally the twelve stones of the breastplate were under the shining of the Urim. When the priest went into God's presence with the breastplate, suddenly a stone inscribed with a certain name became dark. This darkening of a particular stone was God's instant speaking. It was in this way that letter by letter, the high priest was able to spell out a word, then a sentence, then a paragraph, until the full judgment of God was determined. It was necessary to have the complete Hebrew alphabet of twenty-two letters so that any word could be made.</P><P>The writer of this article said that it was through the Urim and the Thummim that the sin of Achan was discovered in Joshua 7. By the Urim and the Thummim, they knew that the one who sinned belonged to the tribe of Judah. Eventually the family and the person were found out (vv. 16-18). The breastplate of the high priest is called the breastplate of judgment in Exodus (28:30) because it speaks for God instantly. Whenever there was a problem that could not be decided or resolved by the written law, the high priest brought the breastplate into the presence of God to wait on God and to read the letters. Then he received the speaking of God. This was the way to receive God's instant revelation concerning His administration. Furthermore, this is why some scholars have called this divine administration in the Old Testament a theocracy.</P><P>After the high priest received the instant speaking from God, he did not directly execute or carry out what God spoke. Instead, he passed on the word he had received to the elders, and the elders became the direct administrators among God's people. Joshua could be considered as the leading elder among God's people at his time. The high priest accompanying Joshua was Elaeazar, a descendant of Aaron. God asked Moses to tell Joshua that if he wanted to know God's will or leading, he had to go to Eleazar the priest, who would "ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord" (Num. 27:21). These two persons went on in God's move together. One bore the responsibility to go into God's presence to receive God's instant speaking, and the other received the divine speaking to administrate among God's people. In principle, the administration of God was always carried out by the elders according to the divine speaking received through the Urim and the Thummim. When the priests became weak, such as at the time of Eli (1 Sam. 1:12; 3:12-14), the prophets were raised up to strengthen God's speaking (3:20-21). God's instant speaking through the priests was by the Urim and the Thummim, but God's instant speaking through the prophets was by the Spirit of God coming upon certain persons to enable them to speak God's word.</P><P>Later in the Old Testament, the children of Israel followed the worldly way to have a king. That offended God (1 Sam. 8:4-7). Their desire for a king displeased God because they wanted a man to reign over them rather than God. God allowed them to have a king, but they suffered as a result (vv. 10-18). Following this king, Saul, God established a man as king who was according to His heart, a man named David (Acts 13:21-22). Even with David there was still the need of the ephod (1 Sam. 23:9-12; 30:7-8; 2 Sam. 6:14; 1 Chron. 15:27).</P><P>When the kingship became weak, the prophets were raised up. When David sinned, Nathan came to rebuke him and to help him in God's administration (2 Sam. 12:1-25). All of the prophets from the time of David through the time of Malachi (Mal. 1:1) were people used by God to speak His instant word to His people in order to help the administrators, the kings, carry out God's administration among His people.</P><P>Whatever happened in the Old Testament was a type of the New Testament government. If we are going to understand God's administration in His move in the New Testament today, we have to go back to the Old Testament to receive the full understanding of the practice of God's administration. God's administration is a direct ruling and governing by God Himself. This direct divine ruling is a theocracy. We must see the principle of God's divine government among His people. His government is by His instant speaking plus the constant written Word. The instant speaking was either through the priests or the prophets, but neither the priests nor the prophets were the direct administrators. The direct administrators were either the elders, the judges, or the kings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Elders Appointed by the Apostles</H2><P>Now we come to the New Testament. In the Old Testament, we are not able to find out how the first group of elders was produced. There is also not a direct word in the New Testament to tell us how the first group of elders in the New Testament church was produced. Both Peter and John were elders in the church in Jerusalem (1 Pet. 5:1; 2 John 1; 3 John 1). James was also an elder there (Gal. 2:9; Acts 12:17; 15:2, 13; 21:18). He was a flesh brother of the Lord Jesus (Gal. 1:19; Matt. 13:55) and was not saved before the Lord's death (John 7:3, 5). Either through seeing the Lord's death or through the appearing of the Lord to him in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:7), James believed in the Lord. Thus, the time from his salvation to his becoming an elder was very short. Eventually, he became the leading elder in the church in Jerusalem. The church in Jerusalem is represented by the name James in Galatians 2:12, and in the book of Acts, James is the prominent one among the elders in Jerusalem (12:17; 15:13; 21:18). How were James, Peter, and John produced as elders? The Bible does not directly tell us.</P><P>When the Apostle Paul was raised up by the Lord and sent out by the Holy Spirit, the Lord used him to establish new churches. Acts 14:23 tells us that Paul returned to appoint elders in each of these new local churches probably within the same year. The appointment of the elders is recorded clearly in Acts 14:23. The elders were established among the saints by the apostles who had preached the gospel to them and had formed them into a local church. Titus 1:5 tells us that the apostles who established the churches had the position and the right to send a representative to establish elders. This was the case with Titus. Titus was representing the Apostle Paul to establish elders in each city of the island of Crete. These verses show us that the elders were properly produced in the New Testament through appointment by those who preached the gospel to them, who taught them the truth, and who formed them with the saints into a local church. These apostles should be the ones who appoint the elders to carry out God's administration in each local church.</P><P>At the very beginning of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, we adopted at least eighty percent of the Brethren's practice. By 1935 we realized that we could not fully follow them because we realized their serious mistake in the matter of the church practice. The light that Brother Nee received during that time is in the book entitled The Assembly Life. Those messages were first given by him in 1934.</P><P>When Brother Nee began to see the light concerning the scriptural practice of the church life, he was still somewhat held by our humility. He said, "Today we are the unofficial apostles, yet the unofficial apostles still have the unofficial right to appoint the unofficial elders." We were very humble. We did not feel good about recognizing that we were the apostles at that time. But we did say, "If we are not the apostles today, at least we are the unofficial apostles. Otherwise, where did the churches come from?" No doubt, all the churches in China came out of Brother Nee's teaching. If he was not an apostle, at least he was an unofficial apostle.</P><P>After a short time, another book was published in Chinese by Brother Nee entitled The Normal Christian Church Life. In this book Brother Nee became bold. He said that if those of us who preach the gospel, teach the truth, and establish and form churches are not the apostles, then who are? He became very strong in this matter. He dropped the prefix un from the word official and said that we were the official apostles and that the elders set up by us were the official elders. Therefore, all of us meeting together here are not unofficial elders. We are the official elders. I realize that some of us are still young, but compared with the elders established by Paul in Acts 14:23, you are not so young. Those elders were appointed by Paul within the same year that their churches were established.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Teaching of the Apostles&#151;<br>the Constitution of God's New Testament Kingdom</H2><P>We have seen that in the Old Testament, the law could be considered as the written constitution of God's people. In the New Testament what replaced the law for God's administration among His people? We know that Christ replaced the law, but we are referring to the aspect and sense of replacing the law in God's administration. In the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles replaced the law. Acts 2:42 says, "And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles." Immediately after the three thousand were saved on the day of Pentecost, they began to continue steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles. In the Old Testament kingdom of God, the constitution was the law, and in the New Testament kingdom of God, the constitution is the teaching of the apostles.</P><P>The teaching of the apostles is the complete New Testament. It comprises firstly the teaching of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels. The first group of apostles were charged by the Lord Jesus to teach the new believers what the Lord had taught them. This is clearly recorded in Matthew 28:19-20. The teaching of the apostles also includes what is recorded in the Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation. At the conclusion of the book of Revelation, John tells us that no one should add anything or take away anything from the divine revelation (Rev. 22:18-19). This means that with the book of Revelation, the teaching of the apostles has been completed. From that time onward, no one is allowed to add or deduct anything. If you add something, you will suffer the plagues; and if you deduct something, you will suffer the loss of the divine blessing. The entire New Testament, which is the complete teaching of the apostles, must be considered as the constitution of God's New Testament kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Elders as Priests and Administrators</H2><P>Paul, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, made this matter of God's administration in the New Testament very clear. He charged the brothers in Corinth to remove a certain sinful man from the fellowship of the church (5:13), which is also the fellowship of the apostles and of the saints. His desire was that this evil person would be removed from the church, but he would not do it by himself because he was not the direct administrator. Therefore, he charged the ones who were the direct administrators in the church. By the New Testament teaching and example, we can realize that some elders had been established in the church in Corinth. Paul gave such a charge to the brothers, but he did not carry out the administration. The elders were the direct administrators of the church there. The written constitution of the New Testament kingdom of God is the teaching of the apostles, the complete New Testament, and the direct administrators in this kingdom are the elders.</P><P>Furthermore, in the New Testament age, there is still some instant speaking. In the New Testament, we have the reality of the high priest and the priests. In the Old Testament, the priests are one group, and the elders are another group. But in the New Testament, these two groups are one. All the believers in Christ are priests to God (1 Pet. 2:5; Rev. 1:6), including the elders. All of the elders are priests, and Christ is the High Priest (Heb. 3:1). Where is Christ? We know that He is seated at the right hand of God in the heavens (Rom. 8:34), but we must see that for God's movement among us on this earth, our High Priest, Christ, is in us (8:10). All of the elders need to declare that Christ, the High Priest, is in them. We have such a High Priest (Heb. 8:1). The elders, who are also the priests, should be the ones who administrate the church in God's government. If there is a problem in the church under the administration of the elders, how shall they solve it? In the Old Testament, it was necessary to study the law to find out what to do to solve the problem. If there is a problem in the church, we have to study our New Testament constitution.</P><P>The United States is a good example of a country ruled by its Constitution. The highest power in the United States is neither the President nor the Congress. It is the Constitution. Because of the power of the United States Constitution, President Nixon was forced to resign from office. Eventually, the Constitution is more powerful than the President. We must admit that today the highest power in the church is the teaching of the apostles. If there is a problem in the church, we have to come to the New Testament to see what it says about this particular problem. We should not say we are for or against something until we go to the New Testament constitution to see what it has to say. When any problem arises, we must learn to be silent and go to the written Word of God, the New Testament constitution, without any opinion. We have a complete constitution with many more details than the United States Constitution.</P><P>If we cannot find anything in our written constitution directly concerning a certain problem or if we can find something and are not clear how to apply it, we need an instant speaking. The time and the way to carry out the written constitution still needs the Lord's instant speaking. How can we have the Lord's instant speaking? We have to get into the presence of the Lord, stay in His presence, and wait on Him, asking Him to show us what to do. Then we have to read the breastplate with all its letters. The stones on the breastplate with the letters refer to the saints, God's people. We have to read the people of the church. By reading the people of the church in the presence of the Lord, with the Lord, and with His loving capacity typified by the breast, we will receive some instruction as to when and how to carry out what is in the written constitution. This is to receive the instant speaking according to the written teaching of the apostles. Of course, we should not do anything that is against the teaching of the apostles. In the Old Testament, no one was to do anything against the law, but to carry out the law, there was also the need of the instant speaking of God Himself. When we have His instant speaking, we are not speaking our own word. What we speak is not something of democracy or of autocracy, but it is of theocracy since God Himself is speaking instantly according to His written constitution to govern and rule His people.</P><P>All of the elders of the church need to realize that they are the real priests. They are the elders and the priests. As an elder, you have the High Priest within you, and you can share in His loving capacity as symbolized by His breast. You love the saints with Christ's love and go into His presence with such a loving capacity, waiting on Him and reading the letters on the stones of the breastplate, that is, reading all the members of the church. By reading the members of the church, taking the members as the letters of a divine typewriter, a word, a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, and even a chapter will come to you, telling you what to do and how to do it.</P><P>We must also remember the principle of the eldership. The elders are always in plurality. Because the elders are in plurality, there is the need of much fellowship. The genuine fellowship must be in the presence of the Lord. If any fellowship among the elders is not in the presence of the Lord, that is not genuine fellowship. Thus, all the elders should exercise the practice of being in the presence of the Lord in the fellowship. In this kind of fellowship, surely the "Urim" and the "Thummim" in Christ's loving capacity would speak. Then the elders would know what is on the heart of the Lord concerning His people and what He desires to administrate in their locality for the church there. The elders are both the priests receiving the instant word from God, and the administrators to administrate what they have received from the Lord. The principle in the Old Testament regarding God's administration is the same in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Prophets and Teachers</H2><P>Besides the elders as the priests and as the administrators, there are the prophets and teachers as illustrated in Acts 13:1-4. In Acts 13 in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers. These prophets and teachers are the ones who can help in the priesthood and in the eldership. They are like the Old Testament prophets who helped the elders, the kings, and the priests. Today in God's administration on this earth, the principle is the same. Besides the ones who are the priests to receive the revelation from the Lord directly and the administrators to carry out what God spoke, there are the prophets and the teachers to help the eldership and the priesthood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Apostles' Relationship<br>with the Churches and the Elders<br>after They Have Been Established</H2><P>After the apostles appoint the elders and commit the church into the hands of the elders, what shall the apostles do in the future? Some say that the apostles have nothing to do with the church anymore. According to their feeling, the appointment of the elders by the apostles was the termination of the relationship of the apostles with the churches. They say this by using Brother Nee's fellowship in The Normal Christian Church Life as a basis. On page 66 of this book, Brother Nee says, "Once a church was established, all responsibility was handed over to the local elders, and from that day the apostles exercised no control whatever in its affairs." In this quote from Brother Nee's book, we should notice the phrase "in its affairs." Some quote Brother Nee's words without realizing the significance of this phrase. (Brother Nee in his book entitled Church Affairs, pp. 149, 14-20, corrected this misuse of his word.) The apostles were to keep their hands off of the administration of the local church in its business affairs, not in its need of the apostles' teaching, instruction, and charge.</P><P>We saw that Paul wrote a letter to the church in Corinth charging them to remove a certain sinful man from the fellowship of the church. The apostle commanded the church to do this&#151;"Remove the evil man from among yourselves" (1 Cor. 5:13). Does this mean that the apostle took the church back under his administration? No, not at all. If this had been the case, he would not have needed to tell others to remove the sinful one. He would have done it directly by himself. In this sense, Paul as an apostle kept his hands off of the church administration but not from teaching, instructing, and charging the church.</P><P>There is another aspect to the apostles' relationship with a local church, which Brother Nee talked to us about, in 1 Timothy 5. First Timothy 5:19-20 says, "Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses. Those who sin reprove before all that the rest also may be in fear." Timothy was charged by the Apostle Paul to receive an accusation against an elder. This indicates that the apostles have authority to deal with the elders even after they have been appointed by the apostles to be elders. If there is a problem among the elders, this case should go to the apostles, and the apostles have to judge. The apostles have the authority to rebuke a sinful elder in front of others. The apostles' hands should be off of the church in its administration, but this does not mean that the apostles have absolutely nothing to do with a local church after its elders have been established.</P><P>The wrong and sinful elders can be accused by the saints, and this accusation should go to the apostles. Eventually, the apostles become a small law court to judge the situation. According to 1 Corinthians 6 even the saints can form a small law court to judge cases among themselves (vv. 1-3). The apostles should make a judgment in cases regarding the alleged wrongdoing of certain elders. It is up to the apostles to justify or condemn them. According to 1 Timothy 5:20, if an elder is judged to be sinful, he can be reproved before the others. A sinning elder should receive public reproof because of his public position. Based upon Paul's word to Timothy in this matter, how can we say that the apostles, who appointed the elders and handed over the church to them, have nothing to do with the church or the elders once they have been established?</P><P>The entire book of 1 Corinthians is a "bothering book." The writing apostle bothered the church in Corinth. The entire book may be considered as a commandment to the local church. First Corinthians 11:34 says, "If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment. And the remaining matters I will set in order when I come." Even after charging the church to take care of so many things, Paul says that he will set in order the remaining matters when he comes. We need to come back to the Word. The Word is our highest authority, our constitution. This verse tells us that some things were not set in order by the Apostle Paul. In his Epistle to the church in Corinth, many things were set in order by Paul's charges, such as the matters of marriage, the eating of sacrifices to idols, head covering, the Lord's table, etc. Paul charged the Corinthians to deal with at least eleven problems in his fellowship with them. He charged the church to do many things. As the apostle he did not have the position to administrate the church, but he did have the position, right, and responsibility to charge the elders to do it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Churches Being Local in Administration<br>but Not Absolutely Independent</H2><P>There is another important item from the Word that we have to realize. The churches are surely local in their administration, but they are not absolutely independent. In our history in the Lord's recovery, we were warned by the Brethren practice of autonomy. All the states of the United States have their own administrations and governments, but they are not strictly independent. The states are separate to an extent, but this does not mean they are absolutely independent. If the states were absolutely independent, the United States would not be one country. It would become fifty countries. The local churches are not absolutely independent. When the apostles kept their hands off of the affairs of the churches, this did not mean that each local church became one independent entity. Nor did it mean that since the churches were under the teaching of the apostles, they became a federation.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 4:17, Paul says, "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church." In all the churches, the Apostle Paul taught the same thing. His teaching was the same universally, not varying in any place. Concerning this matter, we need to look at the seven epistles to the seven local churches in Revelation 2 and 3. The word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches (Rev. 2:1, 7). At the beginning of each epistle, it is the Lord speaking to a specific church (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14), but at the end of all the epistles, the Word says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). What was said by the Lord to the church in Ephesus was the word that all the churches should hear. Every epistle was a particular word to a certain church, yet this particular word should be heard and taken by all the churches.</P><P>On the one hand, the elders of the churches have the right and the position to carry out the local administration of the churches independently. On the other hand, all the churches should listen to the word that the apostles have received of God, which is the teaching of the New Testament. On the one hand, the churches are local separately. On the other hand, all the local churches are still the one Body of Christ which is an organism, not a federation which is an organization. We need to meet as local churches separately according to what the New Testament says, but all the local churches are still the one Body of Christ.</P><P>By the way, I would add a little word. In our fellowship many of us are used to saying, "Brother Lee says..." I beg you, from now on, not to say, "Brother Lee says..." Instead we should say, "First Timothy says..."; or "First Corinthians says..." From the very beginning of the Lord's recovery in the United States, I have passed on the Lord's word to you. You may have received the Lord's word through my speaking, through my teaching, but what I spoke was His word. We all need to come back to the pure Word of God and discern accurately what His pure Word says.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Teaching of the Apostles<br>Being the Real Leadership</H2><P>In 1986 we had an elders' training on the one accord (see Elders' Training&#151;Book 7&#151;One Accord for the Lord's Move, published by Living Stream Ministry). During that time I talked about the leading of the apostles and the leadership in the Lord's ministry, but I do not feel that what I said was accurately understood by some. Because of this misunderstanding, I gave the last two messages in the summer training of 1987 on this matter (see chapters eighteen and nineteen of The God-Ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy published by Living Stream Ministry). In those messages, I pointed out that the leadership in the New Testament ministry in actuality is not the leadership of one controlling person. Instead, we have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry. The New Testament leadership is in the teaching of the apostles.</P><P>In the four Gospels, the leadership was with the Lord Jesus. That was the leadership in a Person. The Lord Jesus was the Leader who had the leadership. In the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus sent His disciples to certain places. His disciples were to obey whatever He said. In the Acts and the Epistles, Peter and Paul were supposed to be the leaders, but for the most part, they did not send anyone anywhere to do the work. All of the going-out workers were sent by the Holy Spirit. Acts 13 tells us that Barnabas and Saul were "sent out by the Holy Spirit" (v. 4) from Antioch to the Gentiles. Of course, Paul did charge some of the younger brothers who were closely related to him, such as Timothy and Titus, to go to certain places and to do certain things (1 Cor. 4:17; Titus 1:5). He charged both Timothy and Titus to come to him, and they received these orders (2 Tim. 4:9; Titus 3:12). But there is at least one case referred to in 1 Corinthians 16:12 that we must see: "Now concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him much that he would come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come whenever he has opportunity." Paul was very burdened to help the Corinthians solve their problems, and their problems involved him and Apollos. This is why Paul expected that Apollos would go to see the Corinthians personally. Paul did not say that he charged Apollos. He said, "I urged him." To urge someone to do something is much different from charging them. Paul said, "I urged him much...and it was not at all his desire." Although Paul urged him, Apollos still had the liberty, the freedom, not to do it. And he did not do what Paul wanted. Apollos said that he would come whenever he had opportunity. This may seem like a small verse, but it is very important to the truth concerning the leadership. This verse is very strong to prove that Paul did not exercise any control over the work for the Lord.</P><P>Paul was not the leader in the New Testament move of God in the sense of commanding the co-workers to do things. Peter and Paul were not strict in this matter of the movement of the co-workers. If they urged a worker to do something, and he felt not to do it, there was no problem. But all the apostles were very strict in the teaching of the apostles. In 1 Timothy 1:3-4, Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently from God's New Testament economy. The apostles would not tolerate any teaching that was different from God's New Testament economy. The aged Apostle John, in his second Epistle, told the saints not to receive anyone who brings a teaching other than the teaching of Christ (vv. 9-10). He said that these ones went beyond the teaching of Christ. This means that they went beyond the teaching concerning Christ, which is the basic teaching of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles. John was strict to the extent that he even charged the saints not to greet such ones. In the matter of the teaching of the apostles, the apostles were very strict. This proves that the teaching of the apostles actually is the real leadership in the New Testament.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FELLOWSHIP<br>CONCERNING OUR GOING ON</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BURDEN FOR TRAININGS</H2><P>Another thing I want to make clear is our burden to have trainings to train the saints. Brother Nee conducted regular trainings for the saints in mainland China. I came out of mainland China to Taiwan in 1949. We started a formal training there for four months in 1953. From that year on, I set aside a few months nearly every year for the training of the saints.</P><P>We practice this matter of training to follow what the Apostle Paul did, to follow in his footsteps. Acts 19:9-10 says, "But when some were hardened and disobeyed, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. And this took place for two years, so that all those dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks." At that time Paul was in Ephesus, and there was already a church there. However, he did some work beside the church but related to and for the church. He did his preaching and teaching in a school, the school of Tyrannus. Tyrannus might have been a teacher, and Paul might have rented his school and used it as a meeting hall to preach and teach the word of the Lord. Paul's work was not within the church but was something beside the church yet still for the churches. Paul felt that there was a need to have such a work to preach to and teach many people. He carried out this work in the school of Tyrannus for two years and the result was that all those dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord.</P><P>Acts 28:30-31 says, "And he remained two whole years in his own rented dwelling, and welcomed all those coming in to him, proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, unhindered." This tells us clearly that Paul rented a place to teach in Rome, and at that time there was a church in Rome. He did a work in his own rented dwelling to proclaim the kingdom of God and to teach the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. No doubt, his proclaiming, his teaching, and his preaching went out to reach a good number of people.</P><P>We had our trainings mainly based upon Paul's example in the two passages we quoted above in Acts. We have a burden to train some seeking saints and some young saints with the word of the Lord. We have seen much blessing upon this work of training. I began to have formal trainings in the United States in 1974. Through these semi-annual trainings, I put out all the Life-studies on the entire New Testament. From 1974 to the present time, approximately three hundred churches, mostly in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central America, and South America, were raised up through the Life-study publications. One brother who was sent by the Lord to Brazil used the one hundred and twenty messages of the Life-study of Genesis to raise up close to one hundred churches there. Hundreds of churches were raised up and continually fed with these publications. If you ask me to stop the training work, and stop the publications, I cannot do it. I must obey my Lord who sent me, who charged me, and who gave me this commission to help His recovery, who gave me this burden of the ministry of His word to release His word. At my age I could go to be with the Lord at any time. Therefore, I am very concerned before the Lord as to how I should use my time. I feel that the first place I should use my time is in doing everything I can to finish the Life-study of the Old Testament. Please bear the burden to pray about this.</P><P>When the Lord sent me to the United States, I endeavored to help the church in Los Angeles, but my primary burden was to release the truth to propagate and gain the increase for the church. In 1970 many saints migrated to spread the church life, and in 1974 I moved to Anaheim. At that juncture I was clear that I should put out the Lord's word. Brother Nee had many direct talks with me about this matter of teaching the Lord's word. He inherited a great amount of truth from all the teachings in the past centuries. I received much help from him because he told me many things. Brother Nee had so much of the truth deposited in him that never was put into print. Piles and piles of his manuscripts were destroyed by the Communists when they took over mainland China. I would say that less than one-third of what Brother Nee spoke was put into print. With so little of what Brother Nee saw and spoke in print, how could the church be built up? This is why by 1974 I was burdened to have the formal training in order to put out the proper understanding of the New Testament according to the top expositions of the top teachers throughout the past nineteen centuries. I still have the same burden to put out the Life-study of the Old Testament. I have even received many letters from the saints encouraging and charging me to do this. This is my burden. I must finish my responsibility before the Lord to make the Lord's revelation in the holy Word as clear as I can to all of us. I must continue to present what the Lord has shown us from the beginning of the Lord's recovery in mainland China through Brother Nee until the present time.</P><P>I am also burdened to train some young saints, not with the expectation that they all will become life-long full-timers to serve the Lord. But we do have an expectation that many of the young college graduates among us will spend either one or two years of time to learn something of the Lord, that is, to learn the Word and to learn the lessons in life. After such a training, they may decide to go back to continue their schooling, or they may go back to get a job. Of course, by having such a training, some will be tested out and approved to be life-long, full-time servants of the Lord. Without this kind of training, how could we have these persons tested out? We feel that the trainings are the best way to get these persons tested out. I also have a burden to see the completion of the evangelization of the island of Taiwan. I believe that can be accomplished in about two years through 1990.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BURDEN TO STAY IN ONE PLACE<br>TO DIRECTLY HELP BUILD UP A LOCAL CHURCH</H2><P>I have a burden to stay in one place for at least nine months out of the year in order to directly help build up the local church there with some elders. In 1922 Brother Nee raised up a local church in his city. Sixty-six years have passed and we have not seen a model of a local church built up entirely according to what we have seen from the Lord. Brother Nee did not have the time to do this. Until now I have not had the time to do this either. After leaving mainland China, I was in Taiwan for about ten years. But I spent most of my time to train the saints, and I spent more than one-third of my time in other countries. We trained many new believers who were saved through our preaching of the gospel when we came to Taiwan. Many brothers who were saved through our preaching became elders. We trained them and built them up. Then many of them became useful ones to bear responsibility in the church or in the work. Some brothers who are now elders in Taiwan are the sons of these useful ones that were raised up. Because I was so busy training the saints, I did not have the opportunity to build up a local church according to what I teach and according to what I have seen of the Lord.</P><P>Many brothers came to me asking for certain ways to do things, but I did not give them a way. I told them to bring this matter to the Lord in prayer and seek the Lord's leading. I did this because I learned a lot in my earlier ministry. In my earlier ministry, I could give people many instructions. Eventually, I discovered that very few of these instructions worked well. We can illustrate this by the teaching of driving a car. A driving teacher can impart the principles of driving to his students and even some details, but his teaching is not the application. When the driving teacher actually drives the car, his driving may be absolutely different from what he taught. He only taught some principles with some details. But quite often these principles do not fit in with the real situation of the road. When he taught driving, he did not realize there would be a big dip on a certain road. He did not anticipate that the roads would be flooded due to heavy rains. He never dreamed that two cars would crash right in front of his car. Some of the brothers may say, "I drive according to Brother Lee's teaching. Brother Lee told me this." But Brother Lee never spoke about "two cars crashing in front of you." My point is this&#151;if the steering wheel of the church were in my hand, I might drive it absolutely different from what I taught you. This driving would be according to the present situation and condition of the church in order to bring the church safely to its destination.</P><P>Thus far, according to my observation, many of the leading ones are still building up the local churches in a "probing way." They heard something and they received some teaching, but in their practice they are not so clear what to do or how to do it. This is why I have the burden to be involved in the direct building of a local church in a certain place if the Lord would give me time. I must be before the Lord as to whether or not I should do this and where I should do this. Please pray for me concerning this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXPERIMENT IN TAIPEI</H2><P>About four years ago, in October of 1984, I went to Taipei to have some new things tested out as an experiment for our practice of the church life. Before I went, I told some of the brothers that I was going to Taipei to try to do something new. I also said that in those three to five years, I would not be able to do much to help the churches in the United States. What I would do was to come back two times a year for the trainings on the Life-study of the Bible. Then what I would do in Taipei would be tested out, and I would have a finished model to bring back to the United States. The churches in United States would be able to follow this model and do something according to it. When I went to Taipei, I told the brothers there that I came back to have a new start and that I would call this a new way. But I did not have the assurance how much this way would succeed or work out. I told them that what I was going to do would be a trial, a test, an experiment. At that time close to eighty new elders were established. I told these elders that their being appointed as elders was not something permanent. Their appointment was also subject to experiment. Maybe after a short time, some would find out that they were not suitable persons for the eldership and they would feel to resign. Or maybe I would find out that some were not so fitting in this responsibility. I repeated this word again and again&#151;we are conducting an experiment. I said that the training center in Taipei was a lab, that is, a laboratory.</P><P>Regretfully, I was not strict in keeping my word to raise up a model in Taipei and then return to the United States with the finished product. When the saints in the United States heard about this, many of them wanted to go there to attend the training. I hesitated but I gave in to their request. Now I regret this. At that time, I should have kept my principle strictly to say "no" to the saints. I should have asked all the saints to please stay in the United States while I tested and experimented various things. Then I could have properly found out whether or not those things worked. I should have kept this principle, but I did not. That was my negligence, and I feel regretful for this.</P><P>Many saints from the United States went to the training in Taipei. In principle the training should have fit the situation of the saints who came from the United States. But I did not have the time to oversee the training that much. I was occupied to the uttermost with the work on the Chinese Recovery Version. I could not even be involved that much with the training. If I had had the time, I would have considered the particular need of the saints from the United States. The training was planned and formed just to fit in with the need of the island of Taiwan. It was not designed to meet the need of saints coming from other countries. My negligence was in accepting these saints to be trained and not doing anything to prepare the training to fit in with their situation.</P><P>Within such a short time of training, we baptized over thirty thousand new believers. If I were able to repeat that time of training again, I would not let the trainees baptize so many. We discovered that we could baptize many people, but then we realized that we did not have the manpower to take care of the new ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LIVING STREAM MINISTRY OFFICE</H2><P>The Living Stream Ministry office is only a business office to serve my ministry for two things: to publish the messages in book form and to distribute these messages in both video and audio tapes. That is all the ministry office should do and nothing else. I did not have much time to check on everything related to the office in the past, but the ministry office has always had this specific function and no other function. This little office is a Levitical service serving my ministry to put out the word of God in print and through video and audio tapes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOING ON UNDER THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES<br>BY SPEAKING THE SAME THING<br>AND BY KEEPING THE ONENESS<br>OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Our going on should be according to what we have seen from the Word. There should not be any control, and the leadership is not in one controlling person. The teaching of the apostles must be the very leadership among us. We all must be under the teaching of the apostles. When I came to the United States, many brothers can testify that I never showed myself as a leader. The leading ones in the churches can testify that I never controlled any church or any saint. I never controlled anything, and I would never control anything. Rather, I would do as much as I can to withdraw from the so-called leadership. I do not mean that I am withdrawing from the Lord's recovery. I have a burden from the Lord, and I must be faithful to Him and to His commission, His charge. But be assured that I will try the best to stay away from the leadership.</P><P>We all need to endeavor to speak the same thing by the Lord's mercy and grace (1 Cor. 1:10). There is absolutely no heresy among us. We do not have any basic problems among us, so it should be easy for us to avoid speaking differently and speak the same thing. Also, by His mercy, we do not have any organization. No one can control the local churches. No one can control anything because we do not have organization among us. I do not control, and the Living Stream office would not control. Mistakes may have been made in the past. But let us live in today and forget about yesterday. We do not even have tomorrow. We only have today in which to live. What happened yesterday is over. If anything was wrong in the past, we need the cleansing blood of Christ as the trespass offering. Past mistakes that have been confessed to the Lord are under the cleansing blood. We need to forget the past and go on. We should not even have any expectation about what will happen tomorrow. We do not need to worry about tomorrow. We live today. No one controls you. All the local churches have the full freedom to go on. As long as you do not do anything against our New Testament constitution, no one would bother you. Among us in the Lord's recovery, there is nothing worth worrying about because basically we do not have any heresy or any kind of organizational control. Everyone in every church has the full freedom to go on. I hope that we would be so faithful and loyal to the Lord's recovery. We should mean business with the Lord that the Lord's recovery will be prevailing and even flourishing on this earth for the Lord's purpose.</P><P>Concerning practices among us such as head covering, baptism, or preaching the gospel, we should let these things be as they are among the saints. If some of the sisters want to wear a head covering, let them do it. If others do not, give them the liberty. We should have this attitude with all the practices in the church life that are outside our common faith. If some feel that they are burdened to visit people for the gospel, let them do it. Those saints who are burdened to visit people for the gospel should not insist on this practice. We should try to avoid different kinds of terms, slogans, and sayings, and try our best to keep the oneness in the Lord's recovery. We must avoid anything that damages the freedom of the saints or the oneness of the Body of Christ.</P><P>It is altogether wise and profitable that we do not expect all the churches to be the same. This is impossible. Even twelve brothers within a local church cannot be the same in everything. If a local church has a burden to visit people in their homes for the preaching of the gospel, they should carry out this commission. They do not need to say that others do not preach the gospel in this way. If others do not feel to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes, that is not your business. Do not talk about who is for this or who is for that. We should not talk in this way. We should not label ourselves or label others. If we want to practice a certain thing, we can do it. If others do not want to practice it, they have the liberty not to practice it. We should not question who is for a certain thing and who is not for a certain thing. This does not help you or anyone else. We all must endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit so that the Body of Christ can build up itself in love (Eph. 4:3, 16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</H2><P>Question: Many times you reach a point in your experience where you have genuine concerns. How can you have fellowship about these genuine concerns without being considered by others as negative and thereby causing another problem? This is a concern to me, and this is related to the freedom of seeking the Lord and the truth.</P><P>Answer: First, let us try to avoid any kind of trouble. Second, we must try our best to make everything open. If I see something in you that would not be so good for the recovery, I must pray for you and seek the Lord's leading to go to you and open up the matters of concern. I should be able to do this without any kind of fear because we are brothers in the recovery, and we can fellowship about these things. I believe that all things have a way to be resolved by thorough and frank fellowship. Please do not do things behind anyone. If I did anything behind you, that would mean that I am not faithful to you or to the recovery. Actually, if I am faithful to you, I am faithful to the recovery. I would never do anything behind you. If there is some problem, I need to go to you to have some open fellowship.</P><P>Today there are many people in the Lord's recovery. There are also a great number of co-workers and elders. We come from different countries with different backgrounds, and we have different kinds of understanding and thinking. To think that we would never have any trouble is a dream. Even between a husband and wife, problems cannot be avoided. What is the way to solve the problems in a family of only two persons? There must be a proper way and a wise way that does not damage their marriage life or hurt their feelings. But we have to be open. I should not do something behind my wife nor should she do something behind me. If we do not avoid this, we will kill the oneness.</P><P>If you feel or observe something concerning the Lord's recovery related to a certain person, you should pray for him. Do not come to him in a rushed way. He is still human, and you are still in the natural life. We should be afraid of ourselves more than anything else. We should be afraid that we would do something in a rush to damage someone's feeling and close the door for open fellowship. After praying for a period of time, we will feel led at the right time to go see this brother. Before we go to see him, we should not say anything to anyone because this kind of "pre-talk" opens the door for the devil to come in. If I have seen something about you that is not so fitting in the Lord's recovery, I should not talk about this to anyone. I should pray to the Lord until He leads me to see you. Then we can open up to one another in love and in mutual understanding. We all have a heart for the Lord, and we all have the same goal to see that the Lord's recovery would be properly going on. Thus, we should have and can have the mutual confidence. I can come to you with the confidence that you would fellowship with me to find a way to get the trouble resolved. I believe that all the troubles can be taken care of by this kind of open, frank fellowship in love. If someone comes to me in this way, I am grateful for this kind of openness.</P><P>Even with three brothers taking the lead in a certain locality there might be some troubles. How can these troubles be resolved? The only way is to have open, frank fellowship in love without fear. I do not feel that anyone is doing anything against me, and I am not against anyone, so we can have open, frank fellowship in love. Even though I was so busy in Taipei, I believe that if some of the brothers had come to me to let me know about some of their problems, I might have rendered some help to the situation. This may have required only two or three minutes. If you come to me, you should come without fear. I am not a tiger. I am just your brother. Some may feel that they are afraid of disturbing me and taking away my time. But when the troubles come as a result of not having the proper fellowship, my time is consumed with them. To deal with the troubles takes at least tenfold more of my time than if you would come to me. Your coming to me would save trouble, and to save trouble is to save time. When troubles like this arise, I receive many letters and phone calls. All the questions are concerning the past or the future. This is why I want to stress that the Christian life is not in yesterday or in tomorrow. The past is over, and we do not know what will happen in the future. The Christian life is today.</P><P>We should be frank and open, but we may feel in wisdom that we should not touch certain matters. If I need to say something, I say it openly to the person whom it concerns. If I realize that more troubles will result from my touching a certain matter, then I exercise my wisdom not to touch it. If I have the real concern, I will pray concerning it. I would not even tell my wife. I have always kept this principle. I exercised myself in this way with Brother Nee. I was with him for eighteen years. Everyone who knows about our relationship can testify that we did not have the slightest problem. Because I practiced this principle, I have avoided becoming involved in troubles throughout the years.</P><P>I hope that all of us would practice this principle. If we have a real concern about a certain matter involving a certain person, we should firstly pray. Then we may have some frank, open fellowship in love. If we realize that the by-product, the result, of our touching this matter will not be profitable, then we should exercise our wisdom not to touch it. We can leave this matter to the sovereignty of the Lord. If we have a burden, we can simply pray. Then we will never create any problems or any different speaking in the churches. I may have the best heart for the Lord's recovery, but I may come with the best heart to a brother and say something that can still be misunderstood by him. We all have to learn from now on to say things carefully and to do things carefully in every way.</P><P>Question: When the leading brothers come together to pray for the church, am I understanding correctly that you do not bring up any of the problems that you see in the saints?</P><P>Answer: Even with what we say to our wives, we must exercise our wisdom in order to have a marriage life with a peaceful and sweet feeling. We must exercise our wisdom what to say and what not to say to our wives. We also have to be careful how much we say. If we are a little careless in talking to our wives, we can create trouble. I know of some cases where a careless word from the husband to the wife resulted in a problem for their entire marriage life. We need to exercise our wisdom.</P><P>If there are three elders in a certain locality, these brothers also need to exercise their wisdom in what they say to one another. If you, as one of the three elders, see some problems with the saints, do not talk to the other two brothers right away. You have to bring this matter to the Lord and pray for it. You can ask the Lord, "Lord, what I feel about this matter may be wrong. Show me the real situation." In prayer you can follow the Lord step by step. Then you will have the leading of the Lord with some amount of assurance that the Lord is with you. In this kind of spirit and with this kind of atmosphere, you can go to the other two brothers. You also may ask the Lord, "Should I go to both brothers or should I just go to one? Which one should I go to?" Maybe the Lord would tell you to go to a certain brother and not to the other one. Wait for awhile. This is wisdom, this will help the situation, and this will never create any kind of trouble.</P><P>The elders should also be careful about letting their wives know the things concerning the church. This is risky and dangerous. Some saints told me things in confidence and charged me not to tell anyone. One dear saint opened up something to me and charged me not to let anyone know. He has gone to be with the Lord, but I have kept what he told me in confidence for over thirty years. I never made this matter known to my wife. Some day all of us will give an account to the Lord, so we must not be loose in what we say or tell others. Whatever we say and do really concerns the Lord's recovery, the Lord's interest, and it is not a small thing. If we would exercise this kind of wisdom, many troubles would be and could be avoided.</P><P>We must do our best to avoid trouble and do our best to say the same thing. All of us are assured that there is no heresy among us, and I do not believe that anyone of us has a bad feeling toward another brother. We should not form parties among ourselves or join any parties. We should not have a different attitude toward some brothers. To one brother you may be nice, but to another brother you are a different person. This is not proper. We should be the same toward everyone. We are in the Lord's recovery and in the church life. To have any preference for certain saints is wrong.</P><P>Question: Some of the saints may hear some rumor or some gossip. They may not become negative themselves or cause some trouble, but the symptom in many cases is that they become discouraged. They lose their heart for the church life. They lose their confidence in the Lord's recovery. There are many cases where this causes them to question the leadership in their church or the ministry among us. This last training on Leviticus was a real medicine, a real balm, and a real help. But I am concerned that many of us may have certain cases in our church where brothers or sisters are not negative, but they heard some gossip or rumor which may be totally unfounded. There may be some element in what they heard which causes them to question. They themselves are not opposing, and they do not form a party. But they lose all their enjoyment, they lose all their heart, and they lose all their confidence. In many cases, they do not even express what they heard, but there is a kind of withdrawing from the church life and a withdrawing from the service. This is a real weakening to these saints. How can we help this kind of brother or sister either in a public way or a personal way?</P><P>Answer: In 1942 there was a big turmoil in the church in Shanghai. That caused the church in Shanghai to close its doors and also caused Brother Nee to stop his ministry for six years. When that turmoil occurred, I was not in Shanghai. After the war in 1946, I went back to Shanghai, and the church there opened its doors. But there was a very small number of saints meeting together compared to their number before 1942. There were only about eighty or ninety saints at the Lord's table. Many saints were offended in this turmoil, and all the arrows were being shot at Brother Nee. He was the target of the attacks. Because I was not there and I am not a person who wants to hear negative things, I am still not fully clear concerning all the problems in the church in Shanghai at that time. When I returned to the church in Shanghai in 1946, I had just recovered from a very serious illness. During the two and a half years of my sickness and recovery, I learned a lot. Mainly I learned about the two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Some of the saints in Shanghai had been very dear to me in the Lord for years. They came to me and checked with me in this way: "Brother Lee, do you believe that Brother Watchman Nee has never made any mistake?" What should my answer have been? Yes or no?</P><P>I was not bothered about this question because I learned in my sickness some lessons concerning the two trees. I checked with the saints who came to me in this way: "Before you condemned Brother Nee as being wrong in certain things, how was your spiritual life?" They responded in a very positive way that their spiritual life was wonderful. They were living and absolutely for the church. Then I asked, "How about now?" Many times they would weep and tell me that they felt lost and that they had lost their heart. They said that the Lord was still with them but that they had lost interest. In other words, their experience after condemning Brother Nee was altogether negative. Then I responded, "Brother, if your saying that Brother Nee is wrong and your condemning of him is something proper, your spiritual life should be better than it was before. Why is it that after condemning him and saying negative things about him, your spiritual life has become so poor?" This kind of fellowship was able to rescue a great number of saints in Shanghai. The saints there came to me one by one in this way. I simply checked with them how their spiritual life was before this negative speaking and how it was afterwards. They all saw that there was a great difference, and they repented.</P><P>I think we can help the saints in the same way. We can ask them if what they heard helped them in their spiritual life. If it helps them, they should take it. If it does not help them, it must be something of the enemy. Whether the thing you heard is true or not, as long as your hearing has a negative influence on your spiritual life, you should not take it. It was not the saints' business to judge whether Brother Nee was wrong or not wrong. Even if what they did was right, what was the result of their doing? The result was to deaden people. Even a little talk about something negative will deaden you. We must help the saints to go along with their inner life and to keep their spiritual life from becoming deadened, hurt, or poisoned by anything. We should help the saints to avoid anything that would deaden, hurt, or poison their spiritual life. This kind of fellowship I had with the saints in Shanghai from 1946 to 1948 issued in the repentance of hundreds of saints. Hundreds repented and came back to the church life. Many went to Brother Nee and repented to him directly.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ORGANIC WAY<br>TO CARE FOR THE CHURCH<br>AS THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</H1><P>In this chapter we want to see the organic way to care for the church as the organic Body of Christ. The spiritual things in the divine revelation are very mysterious, so God used physical things as symbols and figures to help us see them. In Ephesians 3:4 the church is called the mystery of Christ. Furthermore, Colossians 2:2 says that Christ is the mystery of God. God is a mystery. If we are going to know God, we have to know Christ. Christ Himself is also a mystery. If we are going to know Christ, we have to know the church. God is a mystery, Christ is a mystery, and the church is a mystery. If the church were an organization, it would not be a mystery. What can give us a definition, an understanding, and an apprehension of this mystery? In the Bible, God uses our human body as a figure and as a picture of the church (Rom. 12:4-5). Because the spiritual things are mysterious, pictures are needed to describe them. A picture is better than a thousand words. This is why the New Testament uses our human body to illustrate the church as the mystery of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC CARE FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>If we want to know how to take care of the church as the organic Body of Christ, we have to consider how we take care of our physical body. Surely we do not take care of our physical body in an organizational way. Let us come back to the New Testament to see what it says concerning the organic care for the Body of Christ. Ephesians 5:29 says, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church." Just as we nourish and cherish our physical body, Christ nourishes and cherishes the church. A person loves his physical body by nourishing and cherishing it.</P><P>Some have asked me why I am so healthy at my age and why I have lived so long. The first thing I exercise to do is to eat the proper thing and to eat well. We should not eat roughly or quickly, nor should we eat when we are angry. We have to learn to eat the right thing by the right way. This is what it means to nourish and cherish our body. We have to nourish and cherish our body in order to live. Every day we nourish our body with at least three meals.</P><P>Eating nourishes us, but eating the wrong thing in the wrong way can also kill us. Alexander the Great died when he was thirty-three because of overeating and overdrinking. The proper eating nourishes, but improper eating can gradually kill us. To eat roughly and wrongly is a kind of gradual suicide. Long life, of course, is a gift from the Lord. The length of our life is up to Him, but we still must cooperate with Him. During my life, the Lord allowed me to have certain illnesses. These illnesses taught me a lot. By being ill, I learned how to keep myself healthy. We all have to learn how to nourish the church in a proper way to keep the church healthy. We should not try to govern the church. This is organization. To nourish the church is organic.</P><P>To cherish the church is also an organic matter. The word cherish is hard to explain. Note 1 of Ephesians 5:29 in the Recovery Version says, "To cherish is to nurture us with tender love and foster us with tender care, outwardly softening us through tender warmth that we may have soothing, comfortable rest inwardly. This is the way Christ cares for the church, His Body." We may illustrate what the word cherish means by the relationship between a mother and her little child. When a mother puts the little child in her bosom, she is cherishing the child. She is warming the child up, comforting the child, and making the child happy. Many times the mother will feed the child while the child is in her bosom. That little child in his mother's bosom receives everything. He is given a room, a bed, food, drink, and comfort. The mother also rocks him to make him happy. I believe that all this is included in the word cherish. To nourish is to feed, but the mother putting the child in her bosom is not merely feeding. It is the mother affording everything to the child. This is the way that Christ takes care of His Body.</P><P>We should take care of the Body in the same way. In our care for the church, there should be no condemnation, rebuking, or criticizing. Instead, there should be nourishing and cherishing. To nourish and to cherish are altogether matters in life. They are organic. To control, to rebuke, to condemn, and to criticize are altogether organizational. I still remember what I shared in 1976 when we were on the life-study of Matthew. When we were covering Matthew 20 and 23, I exhorted the elders not to control the churches. The Lord Jesus told us that we are all brothers on the same level (23:8). He is the unique Lord and Instructor among us (v. 10). Once a brother becomes an elder, he is a slave to the saints in a church, and his wife becomes the wife of a slave. The eldership is not a matter of a position in a hierarchical sense. That is altogether organizational.</P><P>Then we may ask, "Who should appoint the elders?" The New Testament shows us that the apostles who establish the churches should appoint them (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5). Some have said that after the apostles appoint the elders in a church, they should keep their hands off the church, leaving it to the elders. They have said that the apostles have no more right to touch or to interfere with the things concerning the church.</P><P>Brother Nee's word concerning this matter in The Normal Christian Church Life was misused by some. In 1948, eleven years after he first shared the messages in The Normal Christian Church Life, he released the messages contained in the book entitled Church Affairs. In this book, he mentioned clearly that some brothers misunderstood his word in The Normal Christian Church Life. On page 149 of Church Affairs (chapter nine), he said, "After the meeting in Hangkow, some brothers misunderstood that though the elders are appointed by the apostles, they do not have to listen to the apostles. This is impossible." The strongest proof of this is in Acts 20. While the apostle Paul was on his journey, he still had the burden to take care of the church in Ephesus, and he called for the elders of the church to come to him (v. 17). His word to them was not just a teaching, but a charge (vv. 18-35). This shows that the apostle had an organic relationship with the churches he established.</P><P>Negative things can arise among us because we do not see that the church is organic. If the church is organic, the church does not need to be controlled. Our physical body, strictly speaking, does not need any control. Our body needs to be nourished and cherished. Even an older brother like me needs to be cherished and comforted. This is why I asked at the beginning of this meeting if there was any fellowship and any comfort. This is not my word, but my quotation of Paul's word in Philippians. The apostle appealed to the Philippians for their encouragement and consolation. He begged them to make his joy full if they had any encouragement in Christ, any consolation of love, any fellowship of spirit, any tenderheartedness and compassions toward him (2:1-2). Today I need your encouragement, your consolation, your tenderheartedness, your compassion, and your fellowship to make my joy full.</P><P>The day before yesterday many saints went to the airport to greet me. I thought that the brothers arranged this, but I was told that they all went to the airport to meet me spontaneously. In the past year, especially, I have been under the attack of the enemy. When I came here to Cleveland and saw you all, I was consoled. I am not a weeping person, but if I were, I surely would have wept when I saw you. Your warm welcome at the airport was an encouragement, a consolation, and a fellowship of spirit to me. This was also your tenderheartedness and compassions toward me to make me joyful. All these things are included in being cherished. When you went to the airport to greet me, you cherished me. You "put me into your bosom."</P><P>All of us need the cherishing. Even the apostle Paul needed this kind of cherishing. I am glad to see so many leading ones gathered together for this fellowship. This is an encouragement to me. The Lord in His mercy and grace has put you into your present responsibility. I hope that we all would learn not to control. Instead, we should learn to nourish and cherish the saints.</P><P>In Peter's first Epistle, he spoke to his fellow elders. Peter was an elder in Jerusalem. He charged the elders to shepherd the flock of God (1 Pet. 5:1-2). The word shepherd nearly equals the two words nourish and cherish. A good shepherd always loves the flock, and the flock eventually loves this shepherd. They know each other intimately. To shepherd is not to control. In John 21 the Lord asked Peter, "Do you love Me?" Then He indicated that if Peter loved Him, he would feed His sheep and shepherd His sheep (vv. 15-17). The Lord Jesus spoke this to show how we should take care of the church. We should be those who are one with Him to feed, shepherd, nourish, and cherish the church. This is the organic way to care for the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ELDERSHIP BEING ORGANIC</H2><P>The leading ones' care for the church is not an organizational matter. The church is not an organization. The church is God's family, God's household (Eph. 2:19; Gal. 6:10). All the elders should be the teaching fathers and the nourishing mothers (1 Thes. 2:7, 11). This is the way to take care of the church. It is altogether an organic matter, not organizational. The term elder also indicates something organic, something of life. An elder is a person who is mature in life.</P><P>To see more concerning the organic service in the Body of Christ, let us read 1 Corinthians 12:28: "And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues." Administrations refers to the eldership in the church. Helps refers to the services of the deacons and deaconesses (1 Tim. 3:8-13). Administrations and helps are listed with apostles, with prophets, with teachers, and with works of power, healing, and tongues. This proves that both the helps by the deacons and the administration by the elders are not organizational. They are from the Spirit.</P><P>Now we need to read 1 Corinthians 12:4-7: "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord; and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all. But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable." The word distinctions in these verses can also be translated as distributions. These verses are a summary and a governing word of the whole chapter. Of course, they govern verse 28, which lists administrations and helps.</P><P>According to our natural thought, the government of the church has nothing to do with the distribution of gifts by the Spirit. But 1 Corinthians 12 tells us clearly that even the service of the deacons as helps and the function of the elders as administrations are distributions of gifts by the Spirit. This has to be something of the Spirit organically, not something of organization. Many years ago, I considered that the administration by the elders was not a gift from the Spirit, but later I received the light to see that it is a gift from the Spirit. Since this is the case, it has to be organic.</P><P>The spiritual gifts are of two categories&#151;the miraculous gifts and the gifts of life given according to grace. Romans 12:6 speaks of the gifts of life given according to grace. These gifts are the issue of the development of our spiritual function in the spiritual life. In 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul puts the gifts of life and the miraculous gifts together. Helps and administrations are gifts of life. Since they are gifts, they are something of the Spirit, and they are organic.</P><P>In Romans 12:8 Paul refers to taking the lead as a gift according to grace. This refers to the elders in the church. To lead in the church is to administrate. We may consider that the administration of the church is not of any gift, not of life, or not of the Spirit. We may think that it is altogether a positional, organizational matter. But Romans 12 tells us that to lead, to administrate, to function as an elder in the church, is one of the gifts given according to grace. This indicates that the leading of the elders is organic. It is by life and not organizational. These three words&#151;eldership, administration, and lead&#151;are misunderstood by Christians as something organizational. After much study of the Word, we can see that they are not organizational. They are organic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC MOVE OF THE LORD<br>IN THE GOSPELS AND THE ACTS</H2><P>In the Lord's ministry as depicted in the four Gospels, we cannot see anything organizational. The Lord did not organize anything. He appointed the twelve apostles, but before He died, He did not make any arrangement for His successors. He did not tell the disciples that after He died, Peter would be first and John would be second. In other words, He did not tell them that Peter would be the president and John would be the vice-president. There was not such an organizational arrangement.</P><P>After He was resurrected, He did not come back to the disciples to make any organizational arrangement. Instead, He said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age" (Matt. 28:18-20). This was His "will" to His disciples before His departure. He told the disciples to go and disciple the nations by baptizing them into the Triune God and by teaching them what He had taught the disciples.</P><P>The Lord Jesus' teaching in the four Gospels became the first part of the apostles' teaching. Then Acts records that Peter taught the new believers based upon the Lord Jesus' teaching. That became the second part of the apostles' teaching. Then following Peter, Paul taught, and his teaching became the third part of the apostles' teaching. John taught in his Gospel, in his Epistles, and in Revelation, and some others wrote some Epistles in the New Testament. All of these writings became the last part of the apostles' teaching. All these parts of the apostles' teaching are the contents of the New Testament, which is concerning God's New Testament economy.</P><P>In the Lord Jesus' teaching in the Gospels, there was no organization. Later, in the book of Acts, we see one hundred twenty Galileans organically meeting together (1:14-15). They were living by the Spirit who had been breathed into them on the day of resurrection (John 20:22). Where were those whom the Lord Jesus had saved in Jerusalem and in Judea? All of the one hundred twenty came from Galilee. They came together organically, without any organizational arrangement. If the Lord Jesus had organized something, the disciples might have insisted that Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and others from Jerusalem and Judea join them, but there was no organizing. They met together in an organic way. They lived by the Spirit as the breath which had been breathed into them on the day of resurrection.</P><P>In the book of Acts, Peter and Paul did not organize anything. The appointment of the seven deacons in Acts 6 was not organizational. It was organic. The apostles said that they should not leave the ministry of the word to serve tables. They told the disciples, "Look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need. But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word" (6:3-4). These seven men were full of the Spirit and of wisdom. This does not refer to anything of organization. This refers to life and to the Spirit, indicating that this appointment was altogether organic. This was an organic arrangement. Some may feel that any kind of arrangement must be a kind of organization. Then I would say that this was an "organic organization." The service of these deacons was organized according to life. Their appointment was organic.</P><P>To interpret the Bible properly is not an easy thing. Many have their own interpretation of what the Bible says, but we need the proper interpretation. We need the proper study of the Word and the proper understanding of the Word. Paul charged Timothy to be a person who cuts straight the word of the truth (2 Tim. 2:15). This is like the cutting of wood in carpentry. We have to learn how to cut straight the word of the truth properly without bias. This is to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.</P><P>We need to see from the proper interpretation of the holy Word that there was no organization with the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus. In Acts there was no organization either. Acts 14:23 says that Paul appointed elders in the churches he had established. There is no record, though, of how the elders in the church in Jerusalem were produced. Maybe the twelve became the spontaneous elders there because they initiated the church life, but there is no definite record of this. The first definite record of the appointment of the elders is in Acts 14:23.</P><P>After Paul appointed these elders, he returned to Antioch. Acts 15 then tells us of the big problem concerning the heresy of those who said that circumcision was required in order for one to be saved. Paul, Barnabas, and others went to Jerusalem, and this problem was solved. After coming back to Antioch, Paul proposed to his co-worker, Barnabas, that they return to "visit the brothers in every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing" (v. 36). This was just a short time after the appointment of the elders in these cities. These churches and their elders were new and young. Thus, Paul had a sincere concern for them. After the appointment of these elders, Paul went back to take care of them. This shows it is wrong to say that after the appointment of the elders by the apostles that the apostles should keep their hands off the church, leaving the church absolutely in the hands of the elders.</P><P>The apostle Paul went back personally to visit the churches he had established. As we have seen, he had a concern for the church in Ephesus, and he called for the elders there to come to him. He charged the elders concerning what to do. He also wrote letters to the churches, such as his letter to the church in Corinth. He did not go to Rome, but he wrote a letter to the Romans. He wrote a number of letters to different churches to take care of them, even after the appointment of the elders. This shows that the apostles never gave up the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LEADERSHIP IN THE APOSTLES' TEACHING</H2><P>The New Testament leadership in the Gospels was a person. That person was the Lord Jesus Himself. But from Acts to Revelation, the unique New Testament leadership became the teaching of the apostles. Thus, neither Peter nor Paul controlled any church, but their teaching controlled. We can see this in 1 Timothy where Paul exhorted Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach different things other than the economy of God (1:3-4). Different teachings are teachings which are different from the apostles' teaching concerning God's economy. This teaching is the unique leadership.</P><P>The apostles' teaching is our constitution which governs us. Peter and Paul did not govern the churches. It is the teaching of the apostles, the teaching concerning God's economy, which governs. John told us that if anyone goes beyond the teaching concerning Christ, the New Testament teaching concerning Christ's person and redemptive work, we should not even greet this one (2 John 9-11). Such a person is a heretic who denies the divine conception and deity of Christ, as today's modernists do. According to John's word, we should not have any contact with such an evil person. All of this proves that the governing leadership, after the time of the Lord Jesus, is not a person but the teaching of the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ERRONEOUS TEACHING OF IGNATIUS</H2><P>With the Lord Jesus and with the early apostles, there was no organization. Soon after the time of the early apostles, however, the wrong teaching of Ignatius brought in the human thought of organization. Ignatius said that the overseers, or bishops, are higher than the elders. In other words, the elders are local, and the overseers are regional. But Acts 20 shows that the overseers are the elders. Paul called the elders to come to him, and he told them that the Spirit had placed them as overseers (vv. 17, 28). The overseers and the elders are the same persons, not two different classes of people.</P><P>History tells us that Ignatius was a very good brother, but he made a big mistake by introducing the wrong concept of overseers, or bishops, being above elders. He brought in the thought of organization, which ruins the church. His erroneous teaching eventually issued in the Catholic Church, a religious organization according to a hierarchical system of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. The erroneous teaching of Ignatius was also the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government. The state churches and the private churches in Christianity have also adopted certain aspects of an organizational system of control. This is to follow the customs of society. Because we were raised up in Christianity and influenced by the practice of Christianity, we may understand the appointment of the elders in an organizational way. We need the light to see that even the appointment of the elders is organic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SERVING THE CHURCH ORGANICALLY</H2><P>It is only when the church has degraded and deviated from the line of life, that organization is needed. If the elders take the lead in an organizational way, this indicates that the church has degraded. If the elders live in the spirit by life to nourish, cherish, and shepherd the church, they are not organizational but organic. When a local church is organic, all the serving ones serve organically.</P><P>A brother who is a deacon may say that he serves merely because he was appointed and has no choice. This is organizational. If we ask another brother why he serves, he may say, "Praise the Lord! The Lord is within me. He leads me and burdens me to love Him, and I like to serve the saints. I do not care whether I was appointed to be a deacon or not. Even if the church did not appoint me, I would still like to serve more." This brother's service is organic. To be in the realm of organization is to be in degradation.</P><P>The wrong teaching about the apostles keeping their hands off the church after their appointing of the elders is a degradation into organization. Brother Nee appointed the elders in Shanghai and he still remained there to help the church and the other churches until he was imprisoned. There was no argument in the Lord's recovery organizationally because we practiced the church administration organically, altogether in life.</P><P>All the elders should nourish, cherish, and shepherd the church, but they still need the gifts, such as the apostles, prophets, and evangelists, to come periodically to help them. What if the elders in a certain locality reject an apostle? To merely assert his position as an apostle in an outward way would be organizational. He must deal with them and help them in an organic way. He may express his attitude in the following way: "I have appointed you as elders. Even if you now reject me, I still love you. I still love the church. I will still speak the word of God to you and do my best to help the church and heal you." This is organic.</P><P>We need to come out of all the human, worldly, and organizational ways of Christianity. For over sixty-six years, starting with Brother Nee, we have followed the Bible organically. This is why we say that the elders should not control the churches. We have the burden to help the elders shepherd the church, nourish the church, and cherish the church. We will just do our best to minister the word and to help the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXPERIENCE OF READING THE BREASTPLATE<br>IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD</H2><P>Question: In chapter four of this book (pp. 47-48), you mentioned that the leading brothers should exercise to "read the saints," just as the high priest in the Old Testament read the stones on the breastplate. Could you share something further concerning this?</P><P>Answer: This is based upon the type of the high priest's breastplate with the Urim and Thummim (Exo. 28:30; Lev. 8:8; Num. 27:21; Deut. 33:8; 1 Sam. 28:6; Ezra 2:63; Neh. 7:65). The government among God's people in the Old Testament was neither by autocracy nor by democracy. This government was by theocracy, which means that God governed the people directly, yet through some agents. Today in the church there should also be theocracy, God's governing. In the Old Testament there is a type of God's government. Among the children of Israel, God set up the elders and appointed the priests. The elders did not govern the people according to their opinion or view but according to the direct word from God received by the high priest.</P><P>The way the high priest received the word of God directly was by means of the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim. On the breastplate were twelve precious stones, and each stone bore a name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The twelve names of the twelve tribes only required eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The remaining four letters were put on a piece called the Thummim. Thummim means completion. These four added letters completed the Hebrew alphabet on the breastplate.</P><P>Furthermore, the Urim was added to the breastplate. Urim means light. When there was a problem among the children of Israel, the high priest bearing the breastplate went into the presence of God to seek God's direction. By the shining of the Urim upon the stones, the high priest received God's instant speaking. It was in this way that, letter by letter, the high priest was able to spell out a word, then a sentence, and then a paragraph, until the full judgment of God was determined. Then the high priest passed on God's speaking to the elders, and the elders executed what God had spoken.</P><P>We need to experience this type of reading the breastplate in the presence of God. Today we are both elders and priests. If the church has a problem and the elders need to see how the church should go on, they should go to God with much prayer. In this way the elders will become clear about what the church should do and how the church should go on. In the presence of the Lord through prayer, they can read the letters on the stones of the breastplate, which is to read all the members of the church. By reading the members of the church, taking the members as the letters of a divine typewriter, God's speaking will come to them, telling them what to do and how to do it.</P><P>In the Old Testament times, they had the law of Moses as the constant, written Word, but to have the written Word of God by itself was not adequate. They still needed the instant word of God. They received the instant word by the high priest going into the presence of God to read the names of God's people. We need both the constant word, the word in the Bible, and the instant word, the word from the present contact with God. The instant word should not contradict the constant word. This means that today our guidance from God should correspond with what is written in the New Testament. By this way we can have the leading from the Lord day after day concerning the church. This matter also shows how organic the eldership should be. The eldership is not organizational, but it is altogether an organic matter. The elders need to be living and exercised in contacting the Lord to be enlightened to read the situation among the Lord's people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHURCHES AND THE WORK</H2><P>Question: Could you share something concerning the organic relationship between the churches and the work?</P><P>Answer: In every age since the time of Abel, the son of Adam, God has done some work. God has never been silent. He has always done something in every age. Actually, the age is designated by God's work. God carries out His work by speaking. In every age God works by His speaking. For His speaking, His divine oracle, He always uses a speaker. At Moses' time, Moses was the speaker. At David's time, David was the speaker. At Paul's time, Paul was the speaker. The speaker used by God does God's work by speaking, by the releasing of God's word. Surely this speaking, the oracle of God, will result in something.</P><P>Today we are in the twentieth century. God is surely working in this century. What is the work of God in the twentieth century? In the twentieth century, God is doing the work of His recovery, and His recovery is to build up the Body of Christ. If this is not the work of God today, what is? Surely God does not want to establish and strengthen the Catholic Church and all the denominations. What is God doing today? He is recovering the organic building up of the Body of Christ by the speaking of His ministry.</P><P>The speaking one surely wants the result of his work to cooperate with him to carry out God's work. Let us say that a brother preaches the gospel and some are saved. Would he not expect that these saved ones would cooperate with him to extend the work of the gospel? Is this not needed? Then this brother may go further to establish all these saved ones as a church through his speaking. Would he not expect that this church would cooperate with him to carry on this work? Paul told the Corinthians that he and his co-workers did not extend themselves beyond their bounds. But he expected that as he and his co-workers worked with them, they would grow, and through their growth, Paul could extend his work. In order to see this, let us read what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 10:12-16:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with any of those who commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding. But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you. For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you, for we were the first to come even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ. We are not boasting beyond our measure in others' labors, but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance, so that we may announce the gospel unto those parts beyond you, not so that we may boast in another man's rule in things already prepared.</P><P>The apostle Paul expected that what he preached to the church in Corinth would cause them to grow. Then through their growth, Paul's work would extend (see 2 Corinthians 10:15 and note 1&#151;Recovery Version). In other words, the work establishes the churches, and the churches cooperate with the work for its furtherance. This is organic, and it is logical and normal.</P><P>Paul told the Philippians that he thanked God for their fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel (1:3-5). What is the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel? This was the saints in Philippi participating in the furtherance of the gospel through the apostle Paul's ministry. This was to help the apostle's preaching and to share with his preaching.</P><P>What is the relationship between the work and the churches? The relationship is this&#151;the churches should always help the work and cooperate with the work to promote God's work, and the work should try the best to always strengthen the churches, edify the churches, establish the churches, and build up the churches for the building up of the Body of Christ. Thus, the churches and the work should be very much in cooperation and coordination with each other. This is why we say that the churches should be one with the ministry. This means that the churches should cooperate with the work for the promotion of God's move on this earth. It is logical for a Christian worker to expect the result of his work to cooperate with the work for the promotion of God's move.</P><P>I brought the recovery to the United States, and you received it. You are the result of my work. Should I not expect that you all would be one with me, cooperating with me to promote the Lord's recovery? What is wrong with this? Some opposing ones have said that we should not say that we need to be one with the ministry, that is, the work. They think that this is to build up the ministry. They are wrong. To be one with the ministry is not to build up the ministry. To be one with the ministry is to help the ministry to go on to further the Lord's move on this earth. Eventually, the ministry does not build up anything for the ministry itself. What the ministry builds up is the churches. Today there are over one thousand churches around the globe. In Mexico, Central America, and South America, hundreds of churches have been raised up within the last few years through the ministry, mainly through the printed publications and the audio and video tapes.</P><P>In order for the ministry to go on, the ministry needs the churches' cooperation, support, and prayer. This is what it means to be one with the ministry. To be one with the ministry does not mean to build up the ministry. To be one with the ministry means to strengthen and to help the ministry build up more churches. When I speak to the churches in a conference, this does not mean that I am speaking to build up my ministry. I am speaking to build up the churches. The more the churches cooperate with the work, the better. Then the work will receive more strengthening, more help, and more encouragement to build up and to raise up more churches, and even to edify the churches more, to strengthen the churches more, and to build up the churches more. Then the churches will be greatly helped through the ministry.</P><P>By the Lord's mercy, I have passed on the Lord's recovery to you by speaking. I have been outside of mainland China now for thirty-nine years. Through my ministry in these past thirty-nine years, over one thousand churches have been raised up. The credit for this, without question, all goes to the Lord who spoke through me, but without the support and cooperation of the churches, how much could I do? I did not build up the churches directly. I just spoke the word of God. You brothers build up the churches directly. I was surprised when I came here to see how the brothers are so much for the Lord, with the Lord, and of the Lord. This has been your work. My part is to speak the word of God.</P><P>All of the churches today around the globe were raised up and built up by the Lord's speaking through Brother Nee and through me. The foundation was laid by the Lord's speaking through Brother Nee. Then the Lord used me to speak. But the direct building up of the churches is the work of you brothers. Moses did not build up the tabernacle directly. The tabernacle was built by the children of Israel. Suppose that the children of Israel did not cooperate with Moses. What could have come out? I came to this country to pass on the Lord's recovery to the saints, but if the saints had rejected this, nothing would have come out. But so much has come out through you brothers. A great part of the credit for the Lord's move should be given to you brothers and to the churches. We have to realize that the enemy hates this. We need to pray concerning anything negative that rises up against the proper, organic relationship between the churches and the work, the ministry.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PRACTICING THE NEW WAY TO BUILD UP<br>THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14</H1><P>In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning our need to pick up the new way to practice the Lord's present recovery.

The subject of this chapter of forty verses is not only prophesying but also the encouragement to prophesy. In verse 1 Paul says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy." This verse shows that we need to have an earnest desire to prophesy. In verse 5 he says, "I desire...that you may prophesy." Then in verse 12 he says, "Seek that you may excel to the building up of the church." To prophesy is to excel because "he who prophesies builds up the church" (v. 4). The gift of prophesying is an excelling gift. All the other gifts are not as high or excelling. In verse 39 Paul says, "Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy." From these verses we can see that the Apostle Paul is encouraging, charging, and urging us to prophesy. After covering many items in the first thirteen chapters of 1 Corinthians, Paul encourages us in chapter fourteen to seek this excelling gift for the building up of the church.</P><P>To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is not in the sense of foretelling or predicting. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others. To prophesy is to dispense the very Christ whom we have experienced into others. The subject of 1 Corinthians 14 is prophesying, which is speaking Christ forth into others, dispensing Christ into others by our speaking. This is not human or ordinary speaking but divine and extraordinary speaking.</P><P>According to verse 2 of chapter one, 1 Corinthians was written not only to the church in Corinth but also to "all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours." This Epistle is to us. It is an Epistle to all the local churches. First Corinthians is a book on Christ as our portion, so verse 2 refers to Christ as being "theirs and ours." Christ is their portion and our portion. He is the portion of all His believers. A believer in Christ should be an enjoyer of Christ, a caller on Christ. Our calling on Him is to receive Him, to breathe Him in, to enjoy Him, and to take Him as our portion for our daily practical needs. Every day and every minute, we need this Christ as our support, as our supply, so we have to call on Him all the time. To exercise our spirit to call "O Lord Jesus" is our spiritual breathing. By this kind of breathing, we receive the life supply and the enjoyment of Christ to live Christ. We live Christ by calling on Him as our portion.</P><P>In the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians, we can see the enjoyment of Christ as our portion. In chapter three the growth in life is revealed (vv. 6-7). First Corinthians shows us that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus to enjoy Him, this enjoyment issues in the growth in life. Little children grow by their eating, their enjoyment, of the proper food. If a child eats a lot for three years, but there is no evidence of his growth, something must be wrong. The eating, the enjoyment of food, issues in the growth in life. Furthermore, many of the problems that we have in our physical bodies can be solved by eating the proper food. The life supply that we get from the healthy food kills many germs within us. We may enjoy the taste of good food without realizing that we were taking in many antibiotics. While the food is nourishing us, it is also killing germs and healing us to give us the best health. Our physical strength comes from the nourishing food that we eat. Our eating of the nourishing food issues in the growth in life so that the problems within our physical body may be solved. In like manner, the growth in the divine life comes from our eating, from our enjoyment, of Christ. Because we eat Christ and enjoy Him, we grow, and as we grow, we heal ourselves. By the end of chapter eleven of 1 Corinthians many spiritual diseases have been covered. These diseases are healed by the enjoyment of Christ that issues in the growth in life.</P><P>Beginning in chapter twelve, Paul introduces another subject. This subject is related to our function. A healthy body not only grows but also functions. The more a child eats, the more he grows, and the more he grows, the more he functions. A newborn babe has ears, eyes, hands, and legs, but without the adequate growth, these members will not be able to function adequately. There is the need of development, and the development comes from the growth. Eating issues in the growth, and the growth develops all the parts of our body in their functions. A newborn babe cannot see clearly, but after a few months he is able to see. The seeing comes by the development of his seeing organ through the growth in life. First Corinthians shows us that we need to feed on Christ, to get the nourishment, to enjoy Him. It is a practical matter of life for us to enjoy Christ. Then we will grow and our function will be developed. Every member has its own function, but in the Body of Christ the top function is to speak for Christ, to prophesy.</P><P>First Corinthians firstly shows us Christ as our portion for us to enjoy. Out from this enjoyment comes the growth, and the growth serves to develop our spiritual organs. The functions of these organs are for the building up of the Body. Thus, 1 Corinthians eventually consummates in the building up of the church. It reveals to us that the final result of enjoying Christ is neither the growth in life nor the development of the gifts, but the building up of the Body, the church. Therefore, 1 Corinthians is a book on Christ and the church. Christ can be enlarged and extended by our enjoying of Him. This enjoying of Him issues in the growth in life, and the growth in life brings in much development. As we grow physically, every member and organ of our body is fully developed. Then our entire physical body with every member is functioning, and this functioning has one goal&#151;to build up our body. The functioning of the organs and members of our physical body equals the building up of our body. The more we exercise, work, move, and function, the more our body is built up. Similarly, the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ is the building up of the Body. The more the members of the Body of Christ function, the more the Body is built up.</P><P>In Christ's Body the excelling organ is the speaking organ. Paul, however, strongly belittles the gift of speaking in tongues and exalts the gift of prophecy to the uttermost. To build up the Body of Christ, the excelling function or gift is prophecy. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul concentrates on prophesying. To prophesy is to excel, to place us at the highest point in the building up of the Body of Christ. In the building up of the Body of Christ, prophesying is the top function.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEW WAY TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>When I returned to Taipei in 1984, I was burdened of the Lord to find out a new, scriptural way for us to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ. By October of 1984, I had a deep and clear realization that all of Christianity had nearly come to a standstill. Statistics showed that some of the major denominations were decreasing in number. Whereas the increase in Christianity had been very low, the Moslems and the Buddhists had much increase. We had also come nearly to a standstill in our increase. This fact greatly burdened me for our situation in the Lord's recovery. I went to Taipei to do some research, some experimental work.</P><P>At the very beginning of my study, I found out that for the church to grow up with the proper increase, there is the need for the proper preaching of the gospel. To have the increase in life we need to beget many new ones. If we stop begetting, we will be terminated. If the human race did not have the element of begetting, it would be terminated within a short amount of time. The factor of begetting has kept the human race going on from one man whose name was Adam to billions of people. Begetting is the base of the Lord's move. Without begetting for the increase and spread of the church, we cannot build up anything. Within ten years beginning in 1974, I observed that the churches in Orange County, California had very little increase. Moreover, by 1984 the church in Taipei had decreased in number over the previous twenty years. How can we talk about the building up of the church when we are not begetting or multiplying? I realized that we had to sacrifice something and suffer some loss initially in order to take the new way, but what was the use of remaining in the old way in the same unfruitful state? We needed to sacrifice something to find out some new way. For the Lord to have a proper way out of the denominational traditions, we must take care of four crucial steps: gospel preaching, home meetings, group meetings, and church meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Preaching the Gospel<br>by Visiting People in Their Homes</H2><P>The proper preaching of the gospel is not at all according to the traditional way. I hate tradition to the uttermost because I fully realize that it has greatly damaged and killed many of us without our awareness. Day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year, the evil one, Satan, has been using tradition to slaughter and annul us. Tradition is oldness, and oldness is staleness. Oldness, staleness, and tradition are synonyms. The practice of degraded Christianity, which we to some extent still retain, has become stale. This was the reason that I paid a great price to return to Taiwan in 1984 and stay there for a period of time.</P><P>While I was there, I was before the Lord day and night concerning what He wanted to do. I was considering the way to carry out the proper preaching of the gospel that was outside of tradition and according to God's ordained way revealed in the Bible. I believe that the Lord showed us this way. Concerning the preaching of the gospel, we are fully clear that we need to go to visit people by knocking on their doors. There are many ways to preach the gospel, but visiting people by knocking on their doors is the top way for preaching the gospel.</P><P>Now that we have picked up the God-ordained way of preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes, others are following us to do the same thing. In a conference of some Catholic bishops in 1987, one bishop said that if we have never knocked on people's doors, we have never consecrated ourselves to the preaching of the gospel. The Southern Baptist denomination recently decided to train eighty-nine thousand young laymen to go to visit people in their homes in Texas to get one million people saved within two months. They said that preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes is according to the New Testament plan and will never be improved on. They discovered that this is the top way to preach the gospel. Out of this one million they intend to baptize seventy thousand to make them members of the Southern Baptist denomination. Their success in this endeavor will contribute to convincing all the believers that the top way to preach the gospel is to visit people where they are, to go to their homes.</P><P>To preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes does not exclude other ways to preach the gospel. Peter took advantage of the situation on the day of Pentecost to speak to thousands of people, and three thousand were added in one day. This was a special occasion arranged by the Lord, but it is not the God-ordained way to preach the gospel. The God-ordained way is to go to people where they are. Because they are in their homes, we must go there.</P><P>Actually, to knock on doors means to visit people. This is the scientific way to preach the gospel. It has been fully tested, and the results have been marvelous wherever it has been practiced in a proper way. Anything that is scientific remains. To preach the gospel to the people where they are is not only scientific but also logical and reasonable. Can we be satisfied merely by bringing a few people into Christ by inviting them to come to us? We invited many new ones to our love feasts in the past, but we did not bring in that many.</P><P>A spiritual giant may have big campaigns for the preaching of the gospel, but what is the real result for the building up of the church? Furthermore, when this spiritual giant is gone, who has been perfected to preach the gospel? Tradition has killed us, cheated us, and deceived us, so we must come back to the ordained way of perfecting all the saints. Ephesians 4:11 and 12 say, "He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints." The evangelists are not only for preaching the gospel but also for the perfecting of the saints to do the work of preaching the gospel as they do. We need to be perfected by some evangelists. We do not know how to preach the gospel in a proper and adequate way. Anyone can move his fingers on the keys of a piano, but to learn how to play the piano, a person must be perfected. The Lord's way is for all of us to be perfected. We need to be perfected by the evangelists who are the experts in preaching the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Home Meetings</H2><P>Although we have seen the light concerning how to preach the gospel in the most effective way, we still are not too clear regarding how to have the home meetings. For this one thing I reconsidered the entire New Testament chapter by chapter. The first mention of something related to the home meetings is in Matthew 18:20: "For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst." Later we are told in Acts that the early believers met from house to house (2:46; 5:42). The phrase "from house to house" means "according to houses." This means that every believer's house had a meeting. The number of meetings equalled the number of the believers' houses. The Epistles show us that the early churches often met in a certain saint's home, such as the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla (Rom. 16:5), the church in the house of Nymphas (Col. 4:15-16), and the church in the house of Philemon (Philem. 2).</P><P>Although we know these things concerning the home meetings, we still cannot find much in the New Testament regarding how to have the home meetings. After we learned the proper way of preaching the gospel according to God's ordained way as revealed in the Bible, we began to ask how we should take care of the home meetings. At first, the trainees in Taipei used Truth Lessons for their home meetings. Later, we published Life Lessons specifically to take care of the home meetings with the newly baptized ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Small Group Meetings</H2><P>The New Testament does not say much about how to have the small group meetings. Matthew 18:20 refers to two or three being gathered together. This may be considered also as a small group. Acts 12 says that while Peter was imprisoned, the saints came together to pray in Mary's home (v. 12). This may also be considered as a group meeting. In Hebrews 10:25 Paul says, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...but exhorting one another." This verse may indicate a group meeting. The above three verses, however, do not tell us what to do in a group meeting. This is all that the New Testament says concerning this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Church Meetings</H2><P>First Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 tell us much more regarding how to have the church meetings. We are more clear concerning the care of the church meetings because we have 1 Corinthians 14&#151;a whole chapter of forty verses instructing us how to meet as a church. Verse 23 refers to the whole church coming together in one place. First Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 are particular chapters in the New Testament regarding the building up of the Body of Christ. The more that I speak on these two chapters, the more the light comes. Ephesians 4 has to be connected to 1 Corinthians 14 because without the perfecting of the saints, there is no possibility of having the saints prophesy one by one in the meeting, that is, to have the meeting that is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Brother Nee saw this matter over fifty years ago in 1937, but he told us he could not find a way to practice it. He emphasized it again in 1948, but within a short time the Communists took over mainland China. Brother Nee was put into prison, I was sent out, and we were frustrated again from practicing the revelation that he had seen of 1 Corinthians 14:26.</P><P>After four years of study beginning in 1984 in Taipei, the Lord has given us a clear view of 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4. In June of 1988, these two chapters came to the surface. First Corinthians 14 is a chapter centered on prophesying. The writer encourages the receivers of his Epistle to pursue, to desire, to seek, to excel, and to learn to prophesy. Prophesying does not come in an easy way. A student cannot get a degree without proper and diligent study. We need to pursue, desire, seek, and learn so that we may excel in prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>In October of 1988, I began to tell the saints in Taipei how to prophesy. I was like a coach teaching them the best way, the top way, the excelling way, to play ball. Within three weeks I saw the success in their church meetings. In the past many saints did not know what to do in the church meetings. The leading ones would charge them and urge them to speak, but they did not know how to speak or what to speak. I encouraged all the elders, the co-workers, and the full-timers to take the lead to practice to prophesy by composing a prophecy at the end of every week. They have taken the lead to practice this, and many of the saints have been brought into it.</P><P>Every morning during the week, we should enjoy the Lord in certain verse. We can take down some notes concerning what we enjoy of the Lord each morning. Then we will have notes from six mornings of enjoyment. On Saturday night we can look over our notes of what we have enjoyed during the week. From these notes we can have a topic to compose a short prophecy which is good for us to speak for three minutes. By practicing to speak what we have composed, we can determine whether it is too long or too short, whether we have to delete something or add something. Some in Taipei even pass on their composition of prophecy to someone who acts as a coach to give them more instructions to correct and adjust it. The saints are happy because now they know what to do and how to speak in the church meetings.</P><P>We have all the tools that we need to prophesy in the church meetings. We have the Recovery Version which is a properly translated New Testament with notes that open up the text and many helpful cross-references. We also have the Life-study Messages to help us. We are like carpenters who have the best tools to do the best carpentry to be "an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth" (2 Tim. 2:15). We also have a living spirit to pray and to exercise to get something from the Word. In this sense, it is easy to prophesy because we have the best tools and our spirit. Now we need to learn and practice.</P><P>If we take the way of composing something to prophesy, we will have something to present to the saints in the church meetings every Lord's Day. We will not need to wonder or worry about what to say because we can speak what we have prepared. We will be like the Israelites in the ancient time who labored on their land and eventually reaped something to bring to the feasts appointed by the Lord. They were not allowed to appear before the Lord empty-handed (Deut. 16:16). They had something in their hand to offer to the Lord for His satisfaction. The reality of this is in 1 Corinthians 14:26 where Paul says, "Whenever you come together, each one has..." Today in Taipei this verse has been applied. Over five thousand saints come together every Lord's Day morning in many district meetings of the church in the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26&#151;each one has something. They also take care of the sequence of their speaking. Someone who realizes he should not speak first will wait for the appropriate time to speak his prepared prophecy. When twenty persons prophesy in this way, it is like one person speaking a composed message. The contents are rich and arranged in a very good sequence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</H2><P>In order to have what is described by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14, we must have the perfecting of the saints by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers in Ephesians 4. Some have said that after the apostles establish the churches with the elders, they should keep their hands off, having nothing to do with the churches and elders anymore. If the apostles did this, however, how could they perfect the saints?</P><P>Acts 20 tells us that on Paul's way to Jerusalem, he could not forget his burden for the church in Ephesus. From Miletus he sent for the elders of Ephesus to come to him. Paul told them that he was with them for three years (v. 31), teaching them publicly and from house to house (v. 20). For Paul to teach the saints publicly means there was some public exhortation, probably in front of the saints as a congregation. He also taught them according to their homes, admonishing them night and day with tears (v. 31). Paul did not keep his hands off the church in Ephesus. Rather, he remained with them for three years. When Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem in Acts 20, that was the latter part of his ministry, and the church in Ephesus was an established church. Even with such an established church, the apostle still bore the responsibility to perfect them. He asked the elders to remember how he was perfecting the saints night and day for three years. An apostle should not only speak publicly but also go to the saints' homes day and night to perfect them, to teach them mouth to mouth.</P><P>If the gifted persons&#151;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers&#151;do their perfecting work, spontaneously all the perfected saints will do the same work that they do. The saints will participate in the work of the ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4 tells us that the church as the Body of Christ is not built up by the gifted persons directly. Their work is to perfect the saints. Then the perfected saints do the direct building of the Body of Christ (vv. 11-12).</P><P>Ephesians 4:16 says that the Body builds itself up in love. Where is the reality of such a verse on the earth today, and where can we see a meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14:26? In the early church, there was such a reality for a short time, but it disappeared through the degradation of the church. The Lord needs to recover the reality of 1 Corinthians 14:26 on the earth. We have to believe that now is the time for the Lord to recover this matter. Fifty years ago our senior co-worker, Brother Nee, saw and presented this to us. He is not here today, but this truth remains with us in his books. We are following his steps to recover 1 Corinthians 14:26 for the building up of the Body of Christ. If we are not the persons to recover this verse, who are? If today is not the time, when is the time? Should we go back to the old way to remain in our comfortable situation and forget about this verse, giving up what Brother Nee spoke and published?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONDEMNING OUR HABIT TO NOT TAKE THE NEW WAY<br>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>I realize that it is not easy for the elders of the church to suddenly change to a new way. It is much easier to remain in the old way because something has been set up, and every week they can do a routine work. They do not need to learn anything. They can routinely make the announcements about the scheduled times of the meetings, and appoint certain brothers to speak in the meetings. The only one that really bears the burden for the meeting is the one who has been assigned to speak. The others become passive.</P><P>I believe that we all love the Lord, the saints, and the church. Since this is the case, we must pay the price. Regardless of our age, we should pick up the burden to learn. Those who are close to me have reminded me of my age and have urged me not to labor so much, but I told them that I will not stop laboring until I die. Many of us are still young, and we have many years to learn new things for the Lord's new way. To go on with the Lord, we all have to condemn our habit. Habit is the biggest enemy. A number of years ago, some advised me that we needed computers for our editing work. Now our polishers use computers to do their work, but I do not use one because it is not my habit. I use this example as an illustration of how our habit can hinder us from progressing. I believe that some of the opposition to and criticism of the new way has been due to certain ones' old habit. It may not be out of their heart to criticize or out of their intention to oppose, but their old habit is the problem. They do not want to have a change.</P><P>Some of the elders may want everything in the church under their control. If all the saints have the liberty to go out to knock on doors and baptize people, they may feel that the church will be confused and out of control. They may restrict all the activities of the saints so that everything is in good order under their control. I must say a frank word to my fellow co-workers who act in this way. Let all the saints be freed. Let them go out to baptize people. Give them the freedom to make mistakes. We all know that one of the best ways to learn is to make mistakes. If we are never mistaken, we will never learn anything.</P><P>Furthermore, the old way is not according to the holy Word. The new way is the scriptural way of meeting and serving to build up the Body of Christ. Let us put the old way aside and pick up the new "machine." If a person does not know how to use a computer, he may criticize the use of it. In the same way, I heard the criticism of the new way by those who did not want to give up the old way which was according to their old habit. For Christian brothers to criticize other brothers who go out with the gospel to visit people in their homes is not in a right spirit, with a right attitude, or with a right heart. We need to humble ourselves to learn something that excels. No one can deny that there are many ways to preach the gospel, but the top way is to visit people where they are by knocking on their doors. We should go to their homes and speak to them concerning God, Christ, the Bible, the gospel, salvation, grace, and redemption. This is more than acceptable to our God. Some saints have gone out to visit people when it was raining heavily. This touched the hearts of the people they visited. They were touched that some would suffer to go out in such heavy rain to come to their home to preach the gospel. Nothing can restrict, frustrate, or stop the preaching of the gospel by visiting people in their homes. We can go to every street and every home of the city where we live to find the sons of peace (Luke 10:5-6). Why would we not pick up this way? I have the assurance that if thirty percent of the saints would pick up this burden, every church could be doubled yearly.</P><P>My burden is to present to you what I have received in my four-year study beginning in 1984 in Taipei. We must practice four things. First, we need to visit people in their homes for the preaching of the gospel. Second, we need to have home meetings to nourish the new believers. Third, we need to have small group meetings to take care of the saints and to teach them the truth for their edification. Fourth, we need to have church meetings to exhibit Christ and minister Christ to the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ by the developing and exercising of the saints' organic functions. For this we need to perfect every saint to prophesy. According to the principle of the Bible, it is better that every week we have one day for the church to come together. In this meeting the saints must learn to prophesy. If one third of the saints in a meeting of fifty to one hundred saints would prophesy, the time would be filled up with the riches of Christ. Then the saints will be built up as members of the organic Body of Christ, and the church as the organism of the Triune God will be organically built up.</P><P>If we practice the four points mentioned above, 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 will be fully recovered and the building up of the organic Body of Christ will be taking place on this earth as a strong testimony of the resurrected Christ. Then the bride will make herself ready for Christ, the Bridegroom, to return. Let us endeavor to pick up these four points, these four "machines," to reach the goal.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE<br>OF PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br>FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-16; Acts 20:17-20, 31</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your mercy, for Your love, and for Your grace.

Grant us to be one spirit with You in the speaking of Your word. Lord, vindicate Your way, and speak to us. Make our speaking divine speaking. Lord, we thank You and worship You again. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br>FOR OUR ENJOYMENT</H2><P>We saw in the previous chapter that 1 Corinthians is on Christ as our portion for our enjoyment. In the past I pointed out there are at least twenty items of Christ as our portion in 1 Corinthians (see note 92 in 1 Corinthians 1&#151;Recovery Version). Paul first says that Christ is our portion. He is "theirs and ours" (1:2). The concluding aspect of Christ in 1 Corinthians is that He, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (15:45). If we are going to enjoy Christ as our portion, we have to realize that this portion today is the Spirit. All the items of Christ in 1 Corinthians, such as Him being our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1:24, 30), are included in the life-giving Spirit. Without being the life-giving Spirit, how could Christ be our wisdom? Without being the life-giving Spirit, how could the objective Christ, who is sitting on the throne in the heavens, be our spiritual food and spiritual drink? (1 Cor. 10:3-4). It would be impossible. He had to go through a process to become the life-giving Spirit so that we could eat and drink Him.</P><P>If someone put a big cow in front of me, I would have no way to eat it. The cow would have to go through a process to become steaks to make it eatable. The "raw" God could not be our portion. Because God has been processed, "cooked," we can enjoy Him as our portion. The Word who is God became the last Adam in His incarnation. God became a man. Through death and resurrection this Man became the Spirit. John 1:14 and 1 Corinthians 15:45b tell us of these two "becames." The Word became flesh, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Our God went through these two major processes. Thus, the "raw" God became the "cooked" God, and the "cooked" God today is the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>This truth is not according to today's traditional theology which says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not only distinct but also separate. The Bible, however, tells us that God is one. He is one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is three-one. W. Griffith Thomas, the founder of Dallas Theological Seminary, said that we may borrow the word persons to describe the three of the Godhead, but if we press this too far it will lead to the heresy of tritheism, the teaching of three Gods. According to the truth of the Scriptures the three of the Godhead are distinct but they are not separate. Our portion, who is God embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9), went to the cross as the last Adam in the flesh to die. He then resurrected, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GROWTH IN LIFE ISSUING IN<br>THE PRECIOUS MATERIALS FOR GOD'S BUILDING<br>AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GIFTS</H2><P>If we enjoy such a Christ, we will surely grow in life. In the previous chapter we saw that the growth in life issues in the development of the gifts. We also have to realize that according to 1 Corinthians 3, the growth in life first issues in the precious materials for the building up of the church (vv. 6-7, 12). For us to be transformed into gold, silver, and precious stones is not for individual spirituality. As the materials, we must be precious because we are for God's building. The growth in life first issues in the precious materials for God's building and then in the development of the gifts. To build any kind of building, first you need the materials. Then you need the skills to build it. The materials and the skills are the issues of the growth in life by our enjoyment of the all-inclusive, processed Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God, as the life-giving Spirit. The ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ for the growth in life is the church built with the materials and by the skills.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXCELLING GIFT OF PROPHESYING</H2><P>In chapter thirteen Paul tells us that love is above prophesying. Verse 8 says that love will remain forever, but prophecies shall be done away with. In the first verse of chapter fourteen, Paul says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy." In chapter thirteen Paul made love higher than all the gifts, but in chapter fourteen he made prophesying more desirable. We may say that Paul was promoting prophesying in chapter fourteen. In Philippians 3 Paul promoted one thing&#151;Christ. Christ was promoted to the top by Paul in that chapter. He annulled and belittled everything else to the extent that everything other than Christ was dung (v. 8). In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul also promoted prophesying to the uttermost.</P><P>In verse 12 he says, "Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church." The adjective "zealous" is actually the noun "zealots" in the Greek. What does Paul mean when he says the Corinthians were zealots of spirits? Galatians 3:14 says that the promised Spirit is the very blessing of God's salvation. The top blessing in God's salvation given to us by God is God Himself as the Spirit. Before they were saved, the Corinthians were zealous for demonic spirits, but now that they are saved, they should be zealous for the Holy Spirit. Now that they are believers, they need to seek the excelling Holy Spirit for the excelling gift of prophecy. The word "excel" may also be translated into "abound." Because the context of this verse is one of comparison, that is, one of comparing prophecy with speaking in tongues, "excel" is the right translation here. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul is not talking of abundance or scarcity but of being low or excelling. To speak in tongues is too low, whereas to prophesy is to excel. We should seek to excel for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ.</P><P>Paul promoted prophesying so highly because this is the top gift that builds up the Body of Christ. On the one hand, Christ was promoted by Paul to the uttermost in Philippians 3. Everything other than Him is dung. On the other hand, in building up the Body of Christ, nothing is higher than prophesying. In 1 Corinthians 14:4 Paul says, "He who prophesies builds up the church." First Corinthians 14 is a chapter on prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. This is the goal of the entire book of 1 Corinthians. First Corinthians is on the enjoyment of Christ for the growth in life, and this growth accomplishes two things. First, it produces the precious materials for the building up of the Body of Christ. Second, it issues in the gifts, which are the skills, the techniques, to build up the church of Christ with the precious materials produced by the growth in life. Eventually, this book begins with the enjoyment of Christ and consummates with the built up church.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul promoted prophesying, but he did not tell us how to prophesy. In verse 31, though, he says, "You can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn..." If we speak something and others learn something, that means that we ourselves had to learn first. To speak in tongues is purely miraculous and does not require any learning, but to prophesy is a miraculous normality. Because the one who hears the prophecy learns, the prophesier has to learn first. Paul charges and urges us to prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14. In a sense, he even requires us to prophesy. As long as we are Christians, members of Christ, we must prophesy. Paul was burdened to perfect the saints to prophesy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRACTICE OF PERFECTING THE SAINTS</H2><P>In the book of Ephesians, Paul tells us that the gifts&#151;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&#151;are for the perfecting of the saints (4:11-12). Then Acts 20 shows us how the writer of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul, perfected the saints in Ephesus. The book of Ephesians presents the teaching given to the saints in Ephesus, while Acts 20 presents the practice of the writer. The teaching in Ephesians 4 and the practice in Acts 20 are by the same apostle. Paul taught the perfecting of the saints and he practiced it.</P><P>The record of Paul's practice in Acts 20 opens a window for us to see how to perfect the saints. In Acts 20 Paul said that he did not shrink from declaring to the saints in Ephesus all the counsel of God (v. 27). According to his word in Acts 20, Paul surely taught prophesying to them. If Paul had not taught the Ephesians to prophesy, how could he have said that he declared all the counsel of God to them? According to 1 Corinthians 14, prophecy is a great thing. Prophecy is the excelling gift, the gift above all gifts. Surely Paul taught the Ephesians concerning the excelling gift of prophecy as a part of the entire counsel of God. Furthermore, Paul wrote his first Epistle to the Corinthians from Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:8). While Paul was in Ephesus writing to the Corinthians concerning the excelling gift of prophecy, he was surely teaching the Ephesians the same thing.</P><P>In Acts 20 he told the elders of the church in Ephesus, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time" (v. 18). Paul was with the saints in Ephesus for three years. He not only taught them publicly in meetings but also taught them from house to house (v. 20). Night and day, he did not cease admonishing each one of the saints with tears (v. 31). This teaches us how to perfect the saints. When Paul was teaching the saints publicly and from house to house in Ephesus, he surely instructed them how to prophesy.</P><P>If you ask me how to perfect the saints, I will tell you to read Acts 20. The way is there. First, we need to be with the saints. If I have the burden to perfect the saints in a certain locality, I need to go there, following Paul's pattern to stay there for three years. Paul even went to Ephesus and stayed there without being asked or invited by the brothers. He volunteered to stay with the Ephesians for three years. Second, we have to teach the saints everything we know concerning the counsel of God. We need to be like Paul, who did not shrink from declaring to the saints all the counsel of God (v. 27). While we are staying with the saints, we have to open up all the things concerning God's New Testament economy, His eternal plan. We would share how, according to His economy, He became a man, acquiring humanity in addition to His divinity, and how He died on the cross in a sevenfold way to solve all the problems in the universe. We would also teach many other things concerning His economy.</P><P>In addition to teaching the saints, Paul also admonished them. As an illustration of what it means to admonish, let us consider a father speaking to his son about his need to study diligently. The father might say: "I have taught you to study hard, but you are still so sloppy in doing your schoolwork. As your father, I admonish you with tears to study hard. If you do not get a degree, you will have no future. If you want to live a better life, you must study, son." This is not to teach but to admonish. Paul was so concerned for the saints in Ephesus that his admonishing was with tears. In verse 19 Paul said that he served the Lord with tears, and in verse 31 he said that he admonished each saint with tears.</P><P>As we have pointed out, Paul should have definitely taught prophesying to the saints in Ephesus since he did not shrink from declaring to them all the counsel of God. I also believe that Paul taught the Corinthians about prophesying before he wrote 1 Corinthians. We know that Paul had contact with them before he wrote 1 Corinthians because he referred to a previous letter that he wrote them (1 Cor. 5:9). Before writing 1 Corinthians to them, he must have definitely taught them to prophesy, to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, to speak Christ into others in their meeting. If he had never taught them this matter in the past, he could not have referred them to it. In 14:1 he can say, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy." If he had not taught them prior to that time, the Corinthians would not have even known the term prophesy. How could Paul have charged them to prophesy if he had not taught them something about it and if they had no knowledge of it? First Corinthians 14 indicates that prophesying was taught beforehand to the Corinthians by the Apostle Paul. Therefore, in writing this Epistle, he can refer them to prophesying. Paul was perfecting them to prophesy. Based upon Ephesians 4 and Acts 20, it is clear that the saints need to be perfected to prophesy.</P><P>The gifted members were given to the Body for the perfecting of the saints. Acts 5:42 says, "And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ." We need to ask who "they" are. In Acts 2 the three thousand new disciples met from house to house, but in 5:42 "they" refers to the apostles mentioned in verses 40 and 41. The apostles did not cease in two things: teaching and gospel preaching. They did this in two places: in the temple and from house to house. I believe that they were preaching in the temple and teaching in the houses. The first group of apostles taught from house to house to perfect the three thousand new ones who were saved on the day of Pentecost and those who were saved afterwards. On the one hand, the apostles preached the gospel to the public in the temple, and on the other hand, when people were saved, they went to their homes to teach them. To teach is to perfect. This is the great lack among us.</P><P>In the past, we may have baptized some new ones, but not many of them remained because we left them as orphans. Who went to their homes again and again to teach them? To bring people into the Lord's salvation and then to leave them without perfecting them is a traditional poison that we have inherited from Christianity. In Christianity there are big gospel campaigns in which thousands may be saved, but eventually these saved ones become orphans with no one to care for them. Very few pastors or preachers in Christianity still go out to visit people in their homes. In the old way, we preached the gospel in our meeting halls and invited the new ones to come to us. If some did believe and get baptized, very few picked up the burden to take care of them. This old way has to be condemned and abandoned. If we do not abandon the old way, we will not receive the divine blessing. We need to pick up the burden to go out to visit people with the gospel by knocking on their doors. When some believe and are baptized, we need to go back to their homes again and again to teach them. Some have asked, "We baptized many, but where are they today?" When I hear this, I would ask, "Where are the ones to go back to their homes to teach them day after day?" If a mother delivers a child and does not give any care to the child afterwards, the child will die.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO VISIT PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES<br>WITH THE GOSPEL<br>FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>The first step we need is the step of begetting. To visit people in their homes with the gospel by knocking on their doors is for begetting. We need to do this. We have to admit that we have been very low in our rate of increase. We need to drop all our vain talk and go out once a week to knock on people's doors. Maybe the first week that we go out, we will not gain anyone, but the second week we may get two baptisms. We should not go out to knock on more doors because we have to take care of these two new ones. We have to nourish and cherish them. If one of them is not so positive or open, we can go out again to gain some more new ones. If we do not have the assurance that one out of three that we baptize will remain, we had better baptize four, looking to the Lord that we will gain one of these for the church life. If we take this way, we can surely bring at least one into the church life yearly.</P><P>If some of us do not have the strength or the heart to go out, we should joyfully support those who do. Since we all love the Lord Jesus, love to preach the gospel, and love to see sinners get saved, we should pray for the saints who go out to visit people in their homes even though we cannot go. We should thank the Lord for so many who are willing to go out, praying for them and looking to the Lord for His blessing upon the church. As long as such an activity is for the gospel of the Lord, we should thank the Lord that He has burdened so many. It is not an easy thing to knock on people's doors. The ones who go out may get doors slammed in their faces and they may get rebuked, but they are happy to suffer such a shame for the Name of the dear One whom they love.</P><P>When I went back to Taiwan in 1984, I realized that the first thing we had to do to revolutionize our practice was to take care of the proper preaching of the gospel. We must get the increase for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is why I paid such a great price to return to Taipei to test out this matter of visiting people by knocking on their doors. The Lord's blessing on this scriptural, God-ordained way has been proven by the marvelous results.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TAKING THE SCRIPTURAL WAY<br>FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>After my four-year study in Taipei, I have picked up these four crucial points: 1) begetting by gospel preaching; 2) nourishing by home meetings; 3) teaching by small group meetings; and 4) building up the church by church meetings. These four points are the scriptural way we must take for the building up of the Body of Christ. Now is the time for the Lord to recover 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16. I have the full assurance that the Lord will move today to recover these two portions of the Word. We must admit that the age for these items is here. The tide has come. Sooner or later we will have to go along with this tide. It is not an accident that the Southern Baptists and other denominations and groups realize that they need to have a change in the way that they preach the gospel and serve the Lord. We must abandon the old, traditional way and pick up the new, scriptural way.</P><P>We must be advised, however, not to take the new way in a fast way. We have to take it gradually as I did with the brothers in Taiwan. We spent thirty-seven months to study and to prepare before we completely stopped the old way. We should not take the new way too fast or cause too much loss. We must be careful to go on positively in a gradual way, and we must have a clear view with a definite purpose. We need a clear view that the Lord is finished with the old way. We must have a vision that these two crucial portions of the Word&#151;1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16&#151;need to be fully recovered. The Lord desires to build up the organic Body of Christ, not a congregational church. These portions of the Word must be recovered so that the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God can be built up and prepared to be His bride for His coming again. Our senior co-worker, Brother Nee, stressed this matter twice beginning over fifty years ago, and we must pick up this burden. We have to believe that this is the time and that we are the right people for the Lord to use to recover these two portions of the Word.</P><P>If you do not want to take this way, I am concerned that you will become a dropout. If we see the vision of the new way and practice it gradually to bring the saints under our care into the understanding of such a change, we will not suffer that much loss. Of course, to change anything in practice will always result in some loss, but the profit that will result over the long run makes the change more than worthwhile.</P><P>In order for Paul's teaching in Ephesians 4 concerning the perfecting of the saints to be carried out, we need to follow his practice in Acts 20 and the practice of the apostles in Acts 5:42. Then the saints will be perfected. According to Ephesians 4:16, the saints in the Body of Christ are categorized into two groups: "every joint of the rich supply" and "each one part." The joints are the gifted persons&#151;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers. The Body grows by being joined closely together through the joints and by being knit together through the operation in measure of each one part. Through the gifted persons' supply and through all the members' operation in their measure, all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. The Body of Christ is built up organically by causing itself to grow through the functions of the gifted persons and through the members who operate in their measure.</P><P>For this organic building to be realized, the gifted persons must do their best to perfect every saint. The co-workers and the elders who are taking care of the saints need to go to their homes. If we have a revelation as a new vision, we can call a meeting of the local churches. We can even have a conference with the nearby churches to give a series of messages to cover a particular vision, a particular revelation, which we have received of God. Ordinarily and regularly, however, we do not need to do this. Ordinarily, we need the elders and co-workers to go to visit the saints' homes to teach them personally and directly, mouth to mouth, year round. There is not such a practice among us so far. Thus far, many of the leading ones in the churches do a routine work.</P><P>It is not enough for the elders merely to decide the meeting schedule of the church and come to the meetings in a routine way without any endeavoring. First of all, we ourselves have to dive into the Word to learn how to perfect ourselves. As we are being perfected ourselves, we can go to visit the saints house after house, day and night, to nourish them, cherish them, and teach them one by one sometimes with tears. This will consummate in the perfecting of all the saints. They will all be enabled to speak. Each one part will operate in its own measure. Then all the saints will function, and there will be no clergy or laity among us. All the saints meeting with us will be perfected, equipped, and furnished to speak forth Christ. This will issue in the accomplishment of the Lord's heart's desire, the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The Lord has expected this organic building for almost two thousand years, but what is being practiced in today's Christianity is the traditional clergy-laity system. The mass of the believers are so-called laymen. Here are two ways for us to choose from&#151;the old way of the clergy and the laity or the new way of the organic building up of the Body of Christ through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. We all must take the new, scriptural way. For this new way we all have to labor diligently, especially the leading ones and the co-workers. It is not acceptable to prepare a message to speak once a week, and then take it easy the rest of the week to have leisure time.</P><P>Some have said that we should forget about the work and come back to the enjoyment of Christ, but we need to realize that the enjoyment of Christ always has an issue. If a branch of the vine tree is really and richly enjoying the life juice from the tree, surely the branch will bear fruit (John 15:5). If the branch has not borne fruit for years, it has probably already been cut off (15:2a, 6). A person may think that he is enjoying Christ, but actually he may be cut off from the enjoyment of Christ. He may be self-deceived. Have we been enjoying Christ year after year? Where is our fruit? When I returned to Taipei in 1984, they only had three thousand in attendance at the Lord's table. Today they have five thousand at the table. They also have thousands of new ones that they are caring for in home meetings and small group meetings. The saints and churches who have practiced visiting people in their homes with the gospel have testified of the fruitfulness of this way. Can we give a testimony in a definite way of the fruit that we have borne?</P><P>If the way that I have presented to you is ordained by God and is according to the Scriptures, we have to practice it at any cost. Then the Lord will have a way with us to finish His recovery. Otherwise, we may force Him to drop us and go to others. The Lord dropped others in His move and came to us sixty years ago, but where are we today? The gifted ones&#151;the leading ones and the co-workers&#151;need to perfect the needy saints, not by speaking to them as a congregation but by visiting them in their homes. Some of the older co-workers may feel that they have become useless now that we are changing to the new way. Actually, if the older ones pick up the new way, they will become more useful. Their years of experience are needed for the perfecting of the saints. If we do not go along with the tide of the Spirit in this age, however, we will become dropouts. Time does not wait for us. This why the New Testament tells us to redeem the time (Eph. 5:16). The older ones are more useful, but they have to go along with the present advance of the Lord's recovery.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SEEING THE VISION<br>OF THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY<br>AND PRACTICING IT</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:11-16; 1 Cor. 14:26</H1><P>In this chapter I would like to fellowship concerning how we should go on according to our present situation. We need to see the vision of the Lord's present recovery and put this vision into our practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GIFTS IN THE BODY<br>FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</H2><P>The Bible presents us with a clear picture of God's desire for the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23a), the expression of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). The Lord Jesus told us that He would build His church upon the divine revelation of Himself as the Christ (Matt. 16:18). He does not, however, build up His church directly. In order to build His church, He first accomplished His full redemption from His incarnation through His ascension. In His ascension He poured Himself out upon God's chosen ones to make them His Body (Acts 2:2-4, 16-17a; 10:45; 1 Cor. 12:13), and He constituted some of His members as particular gifts for the building up of this Body (Eph. 4:8). In His ascension He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers (4:11). These are the particular gifts which are considered as the joints of the supply in Ephesians 4:16. The article "the" in this verse is emphatic and indicates a particular and rich supply. According to the New Testament revelation, this particular, rich supply is the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are the rich supply for His Body. These particular riches of the rich Christ are being distributed to His entire Body by the joints.</P><P>We must be clear about these four categories of particular members who are the joints of the Body of Christ: the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. The written record of the New Testament was completed by the end of the first century. In the first century the church did have these four categories of joints. Some have even called the first century the age of the apostles. Those who think this way have a mistaken concept. If we say that the first century was the age of the apostles, this implies strongly that after the first century, there are no more apostles. John Nelson Darby was one who taught that there were no more apostles after the first century. Actually, however, we have to see and admit that there have been these four categories of gifted persons throughout the history of the church.</P><P>There have been evangelists such as C. H. Spurgeon in England and D. L. Moody and Charles Finney in the United States. There have also been many shepherds. A pastor is another term for a shepherd. When the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in the early part of the nineteenth century, many great teachers were produced. They opened up the Bible to a greater extent than it had ever been opened before since the first century. According to church history, there have also been a number of apostles. William Carey went to India and brought the Lord's name, the gospel, and the Bible there. Surely he was an apostle. Hudson Taylor was sent by the Lord to China, and David Livingstone went to Africa. These brothers were also apostles.</P><P>It is hard to make a distinction between an apostle and a prophet. It is also hard to draw a line between the prophets and the teachers. The teachers are very close to the prophets because they both teach. According to 1 Timothy 3:2, the elders must be those who are apt to teach. Furthermore, according to 1 Timothy 5:17, some of the elders should be those who labor in word and teaching. Thus, the prophets, the teachers, and the elders all teach. It is not so easy to distinguish these persons. We have to admit, however, that throughout the past centuries of church history, the church has had the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</P><P>In the early days of the Lord's recovery in China, Brother Watchman Nee was greatly influenced by Brethren teachings. He greatly admired John Nelson Darby. When I went to Shanghai to visit him in 1933, he gave me Darby's synopsis of the entire Bible. I received much help from those volumes. In 1933 Brother Nee was invited by the Brethren to visit them in Europe, England, and Canada. During that trip he saw the real situation among them. He realized that we could not follow the Brethren in an absolute way because of their serious mistake in the practice of the church life. At that time he began to study the Bible to see the proper practice of the church life. The light that he received during that time is in the book entitled The Assembly Life. Because he was influenced by Darby's teaching regarding the apostles, however, he said that we dare not say that we are the apostles today. Actually, some brothers among us at that time were like the apostles, so he was forced to say that we were the "unofficial apostles," while brothers such as Paul, Peter, and John were official apostles. Darby also taught that there were no longer any elders in the church. The Brethren assemblies have "responsible brothers," not elders. Eventually, I considered this matter, and I realized that many brothers are responsible brothers. Everyone who functions is a responsible person. Based on Darby's concept concerning apostles and elders, Brother Nee said in The Assembly Life that the unofficial apostles have the unofficial right to establish and appoint the unofficial elders. At Brother Nee's request, I wrote a long preface to this four chapter book that was published in 1934.</P><P>Within the next three years, Brother Nee saw more light. In 1937 he became bold to say, "If we are not the apostles, who are?" Since the gospel was preached in many pagan regions, churches were established, and elders were appointed, how could there not be apostles? From that time he began to say that we were the official apostles and that the elders established by us were official elders. This light concerning the apostles is in his book The Normal Christian Church Life.</P><P>Throughout the history of the church in these past nineteen centuries, some of God's people were in the category of the gifted ones mentioned in Ephesians 4&#151;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Even today, although Christianity has become so degraded, these kinds of persons are on the earth. These categories of gifted persons are given by the Head and used by the Head to perfect the saints. The Head does not build the Body directly, but the Head gives the gifts. The gifts also do not build the Body directly. Instead, they perfect all the saints, and the saints do the direct building work.</P><P>Even the evangelists are for the perfecting of the saints. For many years my concept has been that the evangelists are only good for going out to preach the gospel, but Ephesians 4 tells us that Christ gave them to perfect the saints. After our four-year study which began in 1984 in Taipei, we see that in the proper procedure to build up the Body of Christ, the first step is to preach the gospel. For this we need the perfecting, the training. The Greek word for perfecting implies the thought of equipping and furnishing. When a person joins the army, they will teach him and equip him with a uniform, weapons, and ammunition. They will also furnish him with supplies. Perfecting is teaching, equipping, and furnishing. It is hard to find someone among us in the Lord's recovery who has really been perfected in the preaching of the gospel. If we were at war and were suddenly gathered to form an army, would we know how to fight? We might shoot ourselves instead of shooting the enemy. We would need to be perfected to fight. When we go out to preach the gospel, this is the real fighting against the devil and his demons.</P><P>A proper evangelist, in his perfecting of the saints, would know how to stir them up. After his speaking to the saints, their hearts would be burning for the gospel. Is there anyone in our locality burning for the preaching of the gospel? There may not be anyone. We may want to preach the gospel, but we may not have the burning spirit to do it. If a real evangelist were to stay with us for even a short period of time, we would be burning for the preaching of the gospel. This is part of his perfecting work.</P><P>There are many things that we have to do to perfect the saints in the preaching of the gospel. In the past whenever I trained the saints to preach the gospel, I first taught the truths of the gospel. I taught truths such as who Christ is, what redemption is, what justification is, and what it is to repent, believe, and be baptized. We prepared a manual with all of these gospel truths in them. Even in the coming days, when we perfect the saints in the preaching of the gospel, we may need to use that manual to see all the truths of the gospel. We need to see the difference between justification and reconciliation and the difference between forgiveness of sins and the washing away of sins. If we do not know these truths of the gospel, how can we preach the gospel adequately? I also taught the saints how to classify the different kinds of people to whom we are preaching the gospel.</P><P>Some of the saints who were trained in Taipei recently picked up new skills in their gospel preaching. When you knock on a person's door and they ask who it is, how you answer will many times determine whether or not they let you in. You may say, "We are here to bring you good news!" This answer may get you in the door, but then you may say the wrong thing to them, and they may ask you to leave. For the preaching of the gospel today, we need more perfecting. The burden of the gifted persons is to perfect the saints, and the perfected saints do the direct building work.</P><P>After being perfected, the saints, according to Ephesians 4:15, will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. Here is a problem. Are not the members of Christ in Christ already? Suppose a brother comes to you, an elder, and says: "First Corinthians 1:30 says that God has put us into Christ. Why then does Ephesians 4:15 say that we have to grow up into Him? Aren't these two verses contradictory?" If you give him a doctrinal answer concerning the twofoldness of the divine truth, you may lead him into the forest. The elders first need to be perfected so that they can perfect others. If you were perfected, you might answer the brother like this: "It is true that we are in Christ, brother, but what about our living? Although you are in Christ, you may still go to the movie theater. Is going to the movie theater the living of one who is in Christ? You are in Christ, but you are not living in Christ in a practical way. Therefore, you need to grow in life so that you can grow up into Christ practically."</P><P>If the saints do not get perfected, how can they grow and cause the Body to grow? In other words, how can they build the church? Ephesians 4:15 says that we need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things, and verse 16 says that out from the Head, all the Body causes the growth of the Body. The entire Body is joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. For the entire Body to cause the growth of the Body, all of us need to be perfected. We have to admit that we are short of being perfected. We may have been generally edified in the past by listening to messages, but how much of the truth has been constituted into us? How many of us can tell what sanctification and holiness are and what the difference is between them? This shows us how much perfection we need. For the perfecting work to take place after the gospel has been preached, there is the need of home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT DOING A ROUTINE WORK<br>BUT ENDEAVORING AND LABORING</H2><P>All of us who are elders and co-workers must endeavor. We must learn from the Apostle Paul who labored day and night and who served the Lord with tears (Acts 20:31, 19). Paul indicated in his Epistles to both Timothy and Titus that they had to stay to teach and train the elders. In Brother Nee's book Church Affairs, he points out that after the elders are established, they need to be perfected by the apostles who established them (pp. 14-21). He points out that there is the need to show the elders how to do the work. Brother Nee saw this and practiced it. One day when I was with him, he told me, "Witness, we have the blueprint in our hand." This meant that he had the plan for building up a local church. While I was with him in Shanghai, I saw something, I learned, and I received the perfecting. Then I went back to Chefoo and practiced what I saw. I stayed in Chefoo from 1940 through 1942, and at the end of 1942, a big revival broke forth. According to my observation of the situation of the churches in the United States, most of the elders are groping because they have not been perfected. Because I have been so busy in traveling to different churches and in the editing of many publications, I have not had the time to stay in one place to be with the saints for an extended period of time. I have had to put out many books to supply the churches with the spiritual food, the life supply.</P><P>What should we do in our present situation as elders and co-workers? By His mercy, we must see a clear view of how the Lord, in His New Testament economy, builds up the churches. He builds up the churches first by giving gifted persons to His Body. Then He uses these gifted persons to perfect all the saints, and the perfected saints do the direct building work. We elders and co-workers should be the gifted persons, yet we may not know how to perfect others. This is why we must endeavor to learn the truths and endeavor to fellowship with one another concerning how to perfect a new one. Immediately after someone gets baptized, we have to consider how we can keep him and perfect him. We may have baptized many new ones in the past, but very few of them remained because no one went back to them again and again to perfect them. To do this requires much labor.</P><P>Instead of laboring, we like to do a routine work. A company, a factory, or a corporation does not make money through its routine workers. I was told a story concerning the Honda corporation that illustrates this point. In one of their big office buildings, there were many Americans in a big office space doing routine work eight hours a day. That work helped the corporation, no doubt, but the real money was made due to the fact that a small number of Japanese in a back office stayed late into the night to labor. It is also true that in the best colleges, the professors must labor hard. There is a slogan in the universities that says, "Publish or perish." We need to put this slogan on our wall to remind us that we have to endeavor to learn something.</P><P>In the past, our Lord's Day morning meetings were carried out in a routine way. Very few came to the meeting with a sincere heart, burdened for the meeting. Most did not bear the burden even to pray for the meeting because they knew the responsible brothers would. The situation in the eldership in some places in the past was not so encouraging either. Before a brother became an elder, he may have been sitting in the back in the meeting without much exercise. One day he was appointed to be an elder, and then he came to sit in the first row. During the meeting the need might have arisen for a hymn or for a word to be spoken. The elders all looked at one another, but no one could meet the need.</P><P>Most of the elders do not endeavor; instead, they do a routine work. If I were doing a routine work, I would not be able to travel so much in order to hold so many conferences, nor would I be able to publish so many books. My fellowship with you here concerns the destiny of the Lord's recovery. It is a matter of life or death. Do we really love the Lord? Are we really for Him and for His recovery? If we are, we have to forget about the routine work, and endeavor and labor to do something extra. Even as an older brother, I am still studying. The point is this: if there is no labor, no work, there is no result, no profit. People who desire to make a big profit in business do not waste their time. Anyone who works only eight hours a day cannot be wealthy. He can only make a living as an employee. Who among us is laboring for the Lord's recovery?</P><P>If we had been laboring, we would have studied the new way to carry out the increase and spread of the church. We would have practiced visiting people by knocking on their doors to find out about it and to break through in our increase. Spontaneously we would have set up a pattern for the other saints to follow. In the flock, the sheep taking the lead may be considered as the head sheep. The elders are the head sheep. When they go in a positive direction, the rest of the saints will follow them. In some places the elders did not do this. Instead of getting into preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes and practicing it to set up a living example, they restricted the saints from knocking on doors and poured cold water upon this practice. Some want to stop the saints from going out to knock on doors. They do not care for the fruit, the increase.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DROPPING OUR OLD CONCEPTS<br>AND PICKING UP THE NEW VIEW<br>OF THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY</H2><P>In order to go on, we all need to drop our old concepts and pick up the new view of the Lord's present recovery. For the building up of the Body of Christ, we need the material. In Haggai the Lord charged the Israelites, "Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified" (1:8). Today we need to go to knock on doors because we need the material for God's house. I am sharing this with the hope that we could be rescued from the wrong understanding and wrong position. We all have to admit that there are many ways to preach the gospel, but to visit people in their homes is the best way.</P><P>The Lord told us in Luke 14:23, "Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled." The higher class people are not in the hedges. Only those who are lazy and idle will be there. In 1 Corinthians 1, Paul says that God has not called many wise, powerful, or wellborn people. Instead, most of the people God has chosen are the weak of the world, the lowborn of the world, and the despised (vv. 26-28). In Luke 14 the Lord told us to compel these people to come in.</P><P>We may be fully biased in our understanding and yet still believe that we are enjoying Christ. If we have not been bearing fruit for years, we may be cut off from the vine without realizing it (John 15:2a, 6). We may be in a self- deceiving position. If we are really enjoying Christ, we will surely bear fruit. Where has our fruit been in the past years? For our local church to remain at the same number year after year is a shame. I must be honest to the One whom I serve and to the ones whom I serve. We are too biased. We must come back to the straight way.</P><P>First, we have to visit people to gain them for the Lord's Body. Second, we must keep going back to visit them to have home meetings. Regardless of how little we think we know, we still must contact them as much as we can and minister to them as much as we know. After a child is born, the mother must immediately begin to care for him. We must go back again and again to visit the new ones begotten through us to take care of them. According to Ephesians 5:29, the Lord knows how to cherish and nourish His Body. We have to follow the Lord to cherish and nourish the new ones. Third, we also have to have small group meetings to teach and perfect them. Fourth, we have to perfect them to speak for the Lord, to prophesy, in the church meetings. Regardless of a person's ability, as long as he will labor, there will be some result. We have received a view of the Lord's present recovery. Now we must put this view into our practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRACTICING THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY<br>ACCORDING TO OUR SITUATION<br>IN A GRADUAL AND POSITIVE WAY</H2><P>You also must take good care of the present situation you are in. You may be in a local church that is not so high, so living, or so encouraging. Hardly anyone may like to visit people by knocking on their doors, and some may even oppose it. What should you do in such a situation? You may have been sick with the same disease, so you should be able to sympathize with all the sick ones. You should be patient with them. You need to visit these dear ones to pray with them, to have fellowship with them, to warm up their cold heart, and to stir up their down spirit. You may have to do this for an entire year to get a few to rise up to realize the burden you are bearing. I believe the proverb that says: "Where there is a will, there is a way."</P><P>We need to practice the Lord's present recovery, His new way, but we should not be too hasty or rough. We need to be patient with the saints and we should not categorize them. We should love everyone with the same love and avoid creating any kind of division. We need to be with the saints the way Paul was in Ephesus. He told the brothers there, "You yourselves know..how I was with you all the time" (Acts 20:18). He was with the saints day by day for three years. Many of us may have to work for a living, but we still should have the evenings and weekends to give to the Lord. We can use our leisure time for the Lord's interests.</P><P>The unbelievers spend much time for their pleasure, amusement, and recreation. Actually, the best amusement is the church life. A brother among us told the story of his grandfather who was a baker. He worked in a bakery from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m., but nearly every day the first thing he did when he came home from work was to go and visit people for the Lord. No matter how we labor, it is much better than being idle. How wonderful it is to be in the Lord's recovery, and now by His mercy we have a way to practice the church life by the preaching of the gospel, home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings. This way is full of labor but also full of joy. If we take this way, we will enjoy the Lord's presence, and we, our family, and our church will be greatly blessed.</P><P>According to our present situation, I feel that the wisest thing is for us to go on in a positive way. We must bring the saints into the full realization of the new way gradually by the Lord's leading. We should not lead the church into this in a hasty way. I want to point out again that the new way is composed of the following steps: 1) preaching the gospel for begetting; 2) having home meetings for nourishing; 3) having group meetings for teaching; and 4) having church meetings for building.</P><P>We have to visit people in their homes to pass on the gospel to them. I hope that all the churches will try to enter into preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes. Once they believe and are baptized, we have to go back to them. In the first month it is best if we can visit them ten times. We need to continue to visit them in order to nourish and cherish them. In the first two or three times with them, we should do our best to help them realize that our Savior, Jesus Christ, is today the life-giving Spirit in their spirit. They need to realize that they have a regenerated spirit which they can exercise by calling on the name of the Lord and praying. Whenever we exercise our spirit, He moves and works within us. We can also help them to speak, first by helping them to give a testimony of their salvation. From the very beginning, we can train them to speak for the Lord. Every time we go to visit them, we can check with them, "Do you have something to say for the Lord or of the Lord?" We should always do this. Then from the very beginning of their Christian life, they will learn to speak the Lord.</P><P>We do not have many verses in the Bible to tell us how to carry out the home meetings and small group meetings, but we know that we need to pray much, exercise our spirit, and release our spirit when we meet with the new ones in their homes. We need to pray, praise, sing, and read verses from the Scriptures in a living way. Then the new ones will follow us and learn from us. The children spontaneously speak the language of their parents. When we release our spirit, they will learn from us. When we speak, we can also instruct and encourage them to speak by exercising their spirit. We can encourage them to first tell how they were saved and then encourage them to speak concerning how they experienced the Lord. They may say: "This morning I did not have any joy. Then I prayed to the Lord and called upon Him, and I became joyful." We can encourage them by saying: "Amen! Hallelujah! This is a good testimony." After about three months, they can be brought into the habit of speaking.</P><P>We need to go on from the home meetings to bring them into contact with other saints in their neighborhood for a small group meeting. In the small group meetings, there is the need of further teaching. It is helpful to use either the Life Lessons or Truth Lessons because all the necessary verses and material are there. It is not necessary to try to finish a lesson in one session. We may cover one lesson in three meetings with them. We also need to perfect the new ones to prophesy in the larger church meetings. Recently, I heard a new one who had only been saved for one year stand up in a meeting to speak on the life-giving Spirit. He spoke a good message concerning all the different titles of the Spirit, the essential and economical aspects of the Spirit, and the functions of the Spirit. Such a new one is evidence that the new way really works.</P><P>If there are fifty saints in a local church, we need to look to the Lord that all of them will be occupied with some practical service to the Lord. Fifteen saints could go out to gain people by knocking on their doors. Another fifteen may take care of the home meetings. Perhaps the ones who go out to preach the gospel could transfer the care of their new ones to the ones who are burdened for home meetings. Another fifteen saints could pick up the burden to take care of the small group meetings. Within a short time, maybe just three or four months, all fifty saints could be occupied with some practical service to the Lord, taking care of new ones and young ones. If each saint could take care of one newly baptized one for one year, think how much this new one would grow! All the teaching materials, the lesson books, are ready for us to use. We can pass these things on to the new ones through the Spirit by much prayer. By taking this way, it will be easy for the church to double in a year. The new ones that we gain will be born, raised up, and taught in the scriptural way. They will be xerox copies of us, doing the same thing that we do in our service.</P><P>It is not worthwhile for us to remain in the old way any longer. We need to take the new way gradually and positively. After the small group meetings, we need church meetings, or district meetings, of about fifty saints. Occasionally, we can have conferences to meet the need of the churches through the ministry of the Word. This way of gospel preaching by visiting people, home meetings, group meetings, and church meetings is scientific. This is the God-ordained, scriptural way that we must take for the building up of the Body of Christ. We pointed out in chapter seven that even the Southern Baptists have said that visiting people in their homes with the gospel is the New Testament plan and will never be improved on. If we do not visit people where they are, how can we expect to gain them? If we only beget them and do not visit them again and again to nourish them and cherish them, how can we expect to keep them? In the past we encouraged the saints to share in the meetings, but we did not properly teach them to do this. If we do not teach the new ones under our care properly, how can we expect them to speak? All over the world today, there is a common system of education with six years of elementary school, six years of junior high and high school, four years of college, two to three years of graduate school for a Master's degree, and another two or three years for a Ph.D. This is the scientific way of educating people that is practiced, in principle, worldwide. The new way to practice the Lord's present recovery is also scientific and cannot be improved upon.</P><P>As we practice the new way, we should not criticize other places that are not practicing the same way that we are. Every place will be practicing the new way to one degree or another depending on the situation in that locality. I also ask the leading ones in every place not to restrict any of the saints. This is my word of love. An elder should not have the attitude that the saints need to get permission from him to go out and knock on doors. The elders may have the heart to keep the church in a good order, but they should not restrict the saints in this way. All the saints need to be free to exercise in order to develop their function. The people in the world exercise themselves by going to worldly and even sinful amusements, but actually the best amusement for the human life is the church life. The church life is the best place for us to exercise ourselves unto godliness (1 Tim. 4:7). To come to the church meetings to sit and listen to others is not to exercise. To exercise is first to pray much and go to knock on people's doors to preach the gospel to them. This will help us to enjoy the Lord more. It will even give us a greater appetite for the Lord as our spiritual food. The more we exercise, the greater our appetite will be. We can continue to exercise in the home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings. We have to instruct the new ones how to prophesy in the church meetings with the exercise of their spirit. We even need to instruct them to speak loud enough for others to hear them. We need to perfect them.</P><P>If we take this new way the Lord has shown us, we will double after one year and many of the saints will have been trained, perfected, and instructed to speak with content. I believe that the Lord will recover this way to the uttermost. The result of this way is not a great congregation of people coming together as a facade to make a good show. If we are faithful to the Lord, the time will come when the Lord will gain twenty thousand out of a city of one hundred fifty thousand. On the Lord's Day, they all may be serving the Lord in different ways. Some may go out to knock on doors, some may go out to take care of home meetings, and others may be taking care of small group meetings. Then many homes throughout the city on nearly every street and lane will be worshipping the Lord, singing hymns to Him, praising Him, and speaking Him. Occasionally, maybe once a month or once every two or three months, the whole church will come together. If we do not have a big hall, we can use an auditorium or a stadium. We do not need the eldership to control things without the proper moving in the Lord's way. This is not according to the Scriptures. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were baptized (Acts 2:41). Within a short time, "the number of the men came to about five thousand" (4:4). How could so many be under the mere control of the elders, that is, without the positive activities according to the Lord's leading? The only way that things could be under the elders' mere control is for the church to remain with a small number. Such lack of increase is a shame to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SEEING THE VISION<br>OF THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY<br>AND PRACTICING IT</H2><P>The way in the past did not work. The Lord desires to discard everything of the old, traditional, and unscriptural way. He desires to do something for His recovery in a new way. We must pick up the view of the Lord's present recovery. Otherwise, we will make ourselves dropouts. We will remain contented in our oldness. Whether or not we will go on with the Lord in His present recovery is up to us. But we have to realize that when the age turns it will not wait for us. Once the age changes, we can be passed by and become dropouts as far as the Lord's move is concerned. We must see the vision of the Lord's present recovery and practice it. Week after week and month after month, we will experience and learn something. As we do this, I have the assurance that the Lord's joy will be with us. Even more, I believe this practice will bring us into His presence. I am so strong in my old age to work so much because I have the deep sensation and consciousness that I have the Lord's presence. While I am speaking, I have the assurance that I am in His presence. His presence gives me the boldness. We must realize that no one can shake the Lord's recovery because it has been built upon life and truth. Although the storms come, the foundation of the Lord's recovery can never be shaken. The Lord's recovery is something built solidly on Christ as the rock, and it is still going on.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF<br>THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><P>Our burden is to fellowship concerning the practice of the Lord's advanced recovery today. Beginning in 1984 I began to have a new study that lasted about four and a half years. The subject of my study was the New Testament way of Christian service. We needed to see how to serve God, how to meet together, how to function, how to carry out the work, and how to preach the gospel. We needed to investigate how to carry out these things according to God's New Testament economy.</P><P>Actually, throughout the history of the church, some of the seeking saints saw certain things concerning how to serve, how to meet, how to function, and how to preach the gospel to save sinners. They saw the truth concerning such things as baptism by immersion and the administration of the presbytery, the eldership, in the church. A big advance concerning the practice of the church life was with Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren in the eighteenth century. Then in the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the British Brethren to recover more. In the twentieth century, the Lord brought us in mainland China into His recovery through Brother Watchman Nee. He took the lead to read about the history of the church and to read the main writings of the seeking ones throughout the centuries. We put many of the things we saw into practice. Later, we found out that some of the things in our practice were not so fitting. In 1931 the Brethren sent some saints to visit us in Shanghai, and their visit caused a lot of trouble. Brother Nee went abroad to visit them in 1933, and he saw the real situation among them. Through that visit, he saw the shortages in the practice of the Brethren. Then he saw the boundary of the local church and the local ground of the church to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ. The Brethren did not see this. Later he saw the revelation of the meeting of the church as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14. According to this revelation, when the whole church comes together, each saint should have something to share, so "each one has" (v. 26). Brother Nee called this kind of meeting a meeting of mutuality. This meeting is not according to the traditional way of meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening. Such a traditional way of meeting has become the major meeting and the major structure of the practice of Christianity. If the meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening were taken away from Christianity, the entire structure of Christianity would collapse. Brother Nee saw that this meeting was not scriptural, and he said that it was according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8&#151;NASB).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE PROBLEMS IN OUR PRACTICE</H2><P>In 1984 I fully realized that we needed to be adjusted and have some advancement in our practice. I saw three major problems in our practice. The first problem was concerning our practice in preaching the gospel. According to the New Testament, the preaching of the gospel should be practiced by the believers going out to visit people, not by inviting people to come to their meeting. Peter spoke to a big congregation on the day of Pentecost, but this happened under God's sovereignty. That big congregation was prepared by God. The major way to preach the gospel is by going to visit people to bring them the Lord Jesus. Related to the preaching of the gospel, the word go is a strong word in the New Testament. The Lord Jesus charged us to go to disciple the nations (Matt. 28:19), and He Himself set up a pattern of going to people. Instead of inviting people to come to Him, He went to visit them. First, He came down from the heavens to the earth to visit people. While He was on this earth, He went out again and again. He went to village after village (Luke 8:1). He sent out the twelve and the seventy to visit people. The Lord charged the seventy to find God's chosen sons of peace among the wolves (Luke 10:1-9). The practice of preaching the gospel in the New Testament is a practice of visiting people, but our practice was different from this. When we began to practice visiting people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, the results confirmed the Lord's way.</P><P>The second major problem in our practice was concerning the way to meet. Brother Nee saw the truth concerning the meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 in 1937, and his messages were eventually printed in the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life. In 1948 he released the messages that are now in the book entitled Church Affairs. In that book he pointed out that the Lord's Day message meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening is not scriptural and is according to the customs of the nations. In 1984 I was reminded of Brother Nee's fellowship, and I realized that our way of meeting was not up to the standard of the biblical revelation. The third major problem that I saw related to our practice was the matter of how the saints should function.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE NEW ITEMS OF REVELATION</H2><P>As a remedy to these problems, the Lord showed me three major items which are all new to me. He showed me the perfecting of the saints in Ephesians 4, the church meeting in mutuality in 1 Corinthians 14, and the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God. Ephesians 4 tells us that the Head in His ascension gave His Body, the church, some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers (vv. 11-12). Ephesians 4 does not say that these gifted persons are for doing the particular work in their respective lines. It says that all of these gifted persons were given by the Head to the Body for the perfecting of the saints, so that the saints, after being perfected, can do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ. Although Ephesians 4 says this clearly, our practice has not matched this revelation. This chapter tells us about the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the very work of the ministry of the New Testament.</P><P>The Lord also showed me something further concerning the proper church meeting unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14. This chapter is a chapter encouraging all the saints to prophesy. Paul says that we can all prophesy one by one. We may feel that we cannot prophesy, but Paul says that we all can. We have the capacity to prophesy. When I use the word capacity, I mean the power or the ability. We have the capacity, the ability, to eat and digest food according to the nature of our human life. Furthermore, all of us normally have the ability in our human life to speak. Human beings have the capacity, the ability, to speak according to their very nature. Paul says that we all can prophesy one by one because the capacity, the ability, to prophesy is in the divine life which the believers possess and enjoy. First Corinthians 14:23 through 25 says that if all prophesy when the whole church comes together, there will be the power there to convict people, to judge people, and to expose people's real situation. When Paul says in verse 24&#151;"if all prophesy"&#151;this means that we all have a universal obligation to prophesy. We have the capacity to prophesy, so we have the obligation to prophesy.</P><P>Verse 1 and verse 39 of 1 Corinthians 14 both say that we should desire earnestly to prophesy. We have the capacity and the obligation to prophesy, and we should desire earnestly to prophesy. Paul also told us in verse 12 that we should seek to excel to the building up of the church. This means that we should seek to prophesy because as Paul said, "He who prophesies builds up the church" (v. 4).</P><P>I became clear that it is altogether possible to have the meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. Of course, this requires much exercise and practice. Due to the traditional practice of Christianity throughout the centuries of church history, many may feel that it is impossible to have the meeting that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. But since I saw the universal capacity, the universal obligation, and the universal desire to prophesy, I began to see that it is possible. There is the full possibility for the attendants of a church meeting to prophesy one by one because all of us have the divine life. There are many spiritual abilities, or capacities, in the very nature of the divine life which we possess. A dog cannot speak a human language because the dog's life does not have this capacity. Human beings can learn a language because in the nature of the human life there is the ability to learn a language. In the same way, there is a spiritual capacity, an ability, in the divine life to speak for God.</P><P>When I began to help the saints in Taipei to practice the God-ordained way, someone said to me, "Brother Lee, everything that you have shared in the past two years is scriptural, but it cannot be worked out." I must say, however, that I have the full assurance that this God-ordained way can be worked out because the Bible tells us so. The Bible says we can all prophesy and that whenever we come together each one has something for building up. This is our obligation. Why do we say that we cannot do this? If we give up this obligation, our attitude is that we need a "clergyman" to replace us so that he can speak to us all the time. We may feel that we need someone to speak to us who has the learning and skill. We may have the attitude of letting a few brothers bear the burden while we rest. But this practice annuls the spiritual capacity of all the saints. I believe that many of the so-called "laymen" in Christianity may be more gifted than many of the pastors.</P><P>In the spring of 1989, the Lord also showed us the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament. The Brethren stressed that all the believers are priests, and we followed them in this matter. We stressed the universal priesthood of the believers, but it was not until recently that the Lord showed us the main offering of the New Testament priests. What should a New Testament priest offer to God? In the past we saw that our praises to God and the things we do for God are spiritual sacrifices (Heb. 13:15-16; Phil. 4:18). However, we did not see that the main work of the New Testament priests is to offer the persons saved through their preaching as spiritual sacrifices to God. The sinners saved through our gospel preaching are the main offerings we should offer to God in His New Testament economy. In Romans 15:16, Paul said that he was a laboring priest of the gospel of God. Today we should preach the gospel as priests.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEW TESTAMENT WAY OF CHRISTIAN SERVICE</H2><P>In giving us the revelation of the priesthood of the gospel of God, the raising up of the new believers, the perfecting of the saints, and prophesying, the Lord has given us a conclusion to our four and a half year study. I considered whether I could find any more verses in the New Testament concerning how to serve, how to meet, how to function, how to preach the gospel, etc. I believe that we have exhausted the revelation in the New Testament concerning the Christian way of service. We now have a conclusion to all the findings of the saints throughout the centuries. We must practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God. The gospel of God regenerates sinners, making them the members of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ. The gospel of God begins from the incarnation of the Triune God with the view of regenerating people and concludes with the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate consummation of the building up of the Body of Christ. The gospel of God is not just telling people that they are sinners and that if they believe in Jesus, they will be saved and have peace and joy. This is only a small part of the gospel of God. The gospel of God is all-inclusive. As the New Testament priests, we are handling the gospel of God to save sinners, to raise them up, and to perfect them until they can prophesy.</P><P>Only two chapters in the New Testament tell us in a clear and definite way how the building up of the Body of Christ takes place&#151;Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14. Ephesians 4 refers to the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the New Testament ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. First Corinthians 14 reveals that prophesying is for the building up of the church. Prophesying is excelling because it builds up the church. Speaking in tongues is not excelling because it does not build up the church. This means that if we do not perfect the saints to prophesy, we have not reached the level of building up the church. Strictly speaking, there has been very little building up among us because we are short of the perfecting of the saints and the prophesying. We may care for having a big congregation, but do we care for the building up of the Body of Christ? We may only have the thought of edifying some of the saints to build them up as Christians. We do not have much thought concerning the direct building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ. The perfecting of the saints and prophesying for the building up of the church are missing among us. The Lord desires to recover these items for the building up of His organic Body.</P><P>In order to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we have to visit people. The conclusion of the Old Testament priesthood and the beginning of the New Testament priesthood were in John the Baptist. He was born to be a priest. Surely his father Zachariah and his mother Elizabeth expected to see their son function in the priesthood by wearing the priestly robe, eating the priestly food, and staying in the priestly place, the temple. But probably to their surprise their son became "naughty." He would not wear the robe of the priest. Instead he wore a garment of camel's hair. The camel was an unclean animal according to the Levitical regulations (Lev. 11:4). Instead of eating the priestly food, John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey. His living was uncultured and without any background of religion. He became a new start in God's move. He declared that people should repent for the kingdom of the heavens. When people repented, he "threw" them into the water. He even worked in a wild way. His living and work ended the Old Testament priesthood. John was the first New Testament priest practicing the New Testament priesthood. He did not offer the animal sacrifices, which were types of Christ. Instead he offered the repentant sinners as sacrifices to God. These repentant sinners were to be parts of the upcoming, enlarged, and corporate Christ. Paul as a pattern of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God also offered the saved sinners to God as spiritual sacrifices (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5).</P><P>The major job of the priests is to offer the offerings. This is their major business. We have to help the saints realize that we are all priests of the gospel. We must go to save sinners to make them offerings that we can offer to God. After this we should help them to grow by having home meetings with them. To have home meetings with them is the best way to help them to grow in life and in truth. Then we have to perfect them, and the best way to do this is through the group meetings. Having home meetings in the new beginners' homes is the best way to raise them up, and having group meetings is the best way to perfect the growing saints. Then we have to lead them to prophesy. In this way they become the acting, functioning, living, real members of the church life.</P><P>The Lord is going to carry out this scriptural way because this has been spoken in His Word. Heaven and earth can pass away, but the Lord's words will never pass away (Matt. 24:35). Every part of His Word will be fulfilled. Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14 will be fulfilled. The New Testament priesthood of the gospel will be carried out. It is just a matter of time. I have the deep feeling that now is the age for the Lord to carry this out. When the Lord's move comes, it comes like a tide. When the tide comes, no one can stop it. Today in the world, democracy is like a tide. Many nations desire to have some form of democracy. The Lord's move today is also like a tide. We have to follow the Lord in an up-to-date way. Right after we began to pay attention to preaching the gospel by knocking on people's doors, the Southern Baptists also picked up this practice. In their recent convention in Las Vegas, many of them went out to knock on people's doors.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO TAKE THE CHURCHES ON</H2><P>As the leading ones, we need to ask ourselves what we will do as we function in the churches. Shall we remain in our old practice prior to October of 1984? Shall we preach the gospel by inviting people to our meetings and meet on the Lord's Day morning with a big congregation and a good speaker while the rest sit and listen? We need to ask ourselves where the real functioning of the acting members in the church is. How do the co-workers among us function? Are they perfecting the saints? We are short in our experience of the scriptural way of service. We must cooperate with the Lord.</P><P>I do not expect this God-ordained way to be fully consummated among us in five years. Rather, it may take twenty, twenty-five, thirty, or fifty years for the Lord to carry this out. To the Lord one thousand years are as one day. We have published many books concerning the scriptural way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ in the advance of the Lord's recovery today. Sooner or later, some of the seeking saints will pick up some copies of these books and practice what has been released in them.</P><P>I do not like to impose this on anyone, but I do have a burden to promote this scriptural way. This way is like a diamond that I am presenting. I will not impose this diamond on you, but if you are wise, you will not miss the opportunity to pay the price to buy it. I realize that some of the churches are not fully ready to take this scriptural way. I am not saying that we need to begin practicing these four major practices right away. But we all have to see that in this age something is coming as a tide. Whether you are for it or against it, the tide will still come. I have the full assurance that this way is easy to work out. We only need to practice it by laboring, striving, and struggling.</P><P>In our locality we need to pray and seek the Lord's leading concerning how to take the church on. It is not necessary for all the churches to be unified at the same time. We need to go on according to what we feel in the Lord and before the Lord. I would like to share something with those of us who have a burden to practice this new way. The best way to begin such a practice is to have a small local conference of three or four messages. In this conference we can present to the saints what the Lord has shown us. We should tell them that this practice is the practice of the New Testament priesthood. Therefore, we all need to have a new beginning in our Christian life every day by being revived every morning. When we have this conference, we should ask the church to pray that we could have the power to stir up all the saints to be revived and ask them to consecrate themselves anew for this practice. Later, some arrangement should be made for the consecrated saints so that they can be formed into groups of three to go out in a regular way to reach people.</P><P>The saints do not need to do too much because that will tire them out and frustrate them. It is better not to do too much. Instead we need to labor regularly and constantly. We only need to go out once a week for two hours. If we have the proper practice with adequate prayer, we will get some to believe and be baptized. Once we baptize two or three new ones, we should not go out to gain more people. We need to care for the two or three the Lord has given us by having home meetings with them in their homes. We should have home meetings with them at least once a week. Probably at the beginning we need to visit them twice a week, every three or four days. We have to visit them to nourish and cherish them. Then we gradually need to encourage them to come out of their homes to join the group meetings.</P><P>We need to take care of the new believers for at least six months. It is best if we can care for them for a year until they are established. After one year of care, they can be perfected. We should carry out the new way according to all the fellowship we have published in the recent past. If we follow the details of this fellowship in our practice, we will see that it really works. The new ones will be brought on quickly or slowly according to their particular case. As we care for them for six months to a year, they will be ready to present themselves as a living sacrifice to God as Romans 12:1 instructs. Eventually, they should be able to do what we can do in the priesthood of the gospel. Our group meetings will increase and eventually will have to divide.</P><P>We hope that at least about one-third of the saints in the church would practice this kind of gospel visitation. Suppose there is a church with one hundred saints. The leading brothers should pray, "Lord, raise up at least thirty-five of the saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel. We even ask You for fifty." I have the assurance that if we practice this way according to what we have published, every saint who is exercised in this way will bring in two new ones a year. With this kind of endeavor, it is possible for the church to double in a year. Even if the church increases yearly by thirty percent, that would be the fastest growing church on this earth.</P><P>I would like to say again that the first step is to have a conference to stir up the saints. Then the saints who want to take this way can be grouped into teams of three to go out to visit people regularly. They can keep going to visit the ones they gain for six months to a year. After one year a group meeting should increase in size so that it can be divided into two groups.</P><P>The group meeting occupies eighty percent of the practical church life. The main part of the church life depends on the group meetings. In the group meetings, the saints will be spontaneously perfected to prophesy. Whether or not the saints will prophesy depends upon our practice of the group meetings. We need to take the first step to get people saved and the second step to have home meetings with them in order to raise them up in the way that parents raise up their children. Then we need to bring them into the group meetings so that they can be perfected. Nearly everyone who attends the group meetings constantly and regularly will prophesy. They will be able to prophesy, and they will have a desire to prophesy. In order to practice the group meetings in an organic way, we have much to learn.</P><P>We do not want to compel people to take anything or impose what we have learned on others, but we need to have some discernment to know the more excellent things. The four major steps in the advance of the Lord's recovery today are workable, but they require our constant and regular labor. In Colossians 1:28, Paul said that he announced Christ, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom to present every man full-grown in Christ. Then in verse 29 he said, "For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power." We need this kind of labor. This new way will make everyone busy because it will afford everyone the opportunity to function, to serve.</P><P>The governing principle of the Lord's ordained way is that it affords equal opportunity to all the members of the Body of Christ. In preaching the gospel, in home meetings, in the group meetings, in prophesying in the church meetings, the opportunity is afforded to each of the saints. This is God's way. The traditional way robs the saints of their opportunity to function and gives this opportunity to a small clerical class. Thus, the clergy has all the opportunities, and they do everything. The so-called laymen are left with little opportunity to do anything. In this clergy-laity system, the saints are annulled in their capacity of the divine life. In the divine life there is the capacity, the power, the ability to speak for the Lord. According to the old, traditional way, the believers seemingly have little ability because they are not allowed to participate in anything. They become pew members, coming to a Lord's Day service to listen to a professional speaker. The Lord's ordained way releases the saints from the bondage of this system.</P><P>Of course, to have any change is difficult at the beginning. To take the new way is not so easy because we are not used to it. I fully sympathize with the elders who are taking the lead and bearing the responsibility of the churches. It is easy to carry on in the old way because so much of the service is carried out in a routine way. There is not the need of much labor. But to carry out the new way, we have to practice diligently to learn something. Then we have to help others to enter into what we have learned to bring them into functioning with equal opportunity. I believe that in another five years, we will begin to see the consequence, the result, the coming out, of the new way. We want to be brought into a situation in which everyone can preach the gospel, everyone can take care of new ones, everyone can perfect others in the group meetings, and everyone can speak forth the Lord into others. Thus, whenever we come together we will have many ministers. We must exercise to discern the excellent things and the excellent way. The new way is the excellent way to organically build up the Body of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF<br>THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><P>In this chapter, I want us to be impressed that we should not function, serve, or meet in a natural way. We may think that serving God, preaching the gospel, or functioning to give a testimony are things that we can do easily and naturally. Actually, however, our service in the New Testament is not like this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORSHIPPING GOD ACCORDING TO<br>HIS NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</H2><P>In John 4 the Samaritan woman talked with the Lord Jesus about worshipping God. Her talk was altogether natural. She said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" (v. 20). Then the Lord Jesus adjusted her by saying that the worship the Father God seeks after is absolutely different from this. God is Spirit, so those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth (v. 24). Today by His mercy and under His enlightenment, we can say that we are clear what it means to worship God in our spirit. But it requires much understanding for us to realize what it is to worship God, the very Spirit, in truth.</P><P>Truth in John 4:24 refers to God's truthfulness in which we participate. Then this truthfulness of God becomes our virtue in our human living. Actually, this is Christ lived out in our daily life. We worship God in such a Christ. Christ is the reality of the Triune God, and this reality is God's truthfulness. This truthfulness in which we participate becomes our enjoyment. Then it becomes the virtue in our human living, which is Christ lived out in our daily life. Today we worship God in such a Christ and in our spirit. This is altogether not natural. According to my study and observation, many of the brothers in the recovery talk about how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach with a natural view. This is wrong.</P><P>If we want to see something concerning the biblical, God-ordained way to meet, to serve, to function, and to preach, we must forget what we think that we understand. We must let go of the things that we have heard in the past concerning the traditional way. How can we escape the tradition of the old, vast, and heavy system of Christianity? In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5 through 7, the first blessing is the blessing of being poor in spirit (5:3). To be poor in spirit is to be emptied in our spirit, in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation, but unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens. To the Jews, to be poor in spirit meant to empty out all the old knowledge of the Jewish religion, all the old knowledge concerning Moses, concerning Elijah, concerning the Old Testament temple, priesthood, offerings, etc. Everyone who was born as a Jew knew a lot. Then something new came embodied in this one person, Jesus. He told us that if we are going to be blessed with the kingdom of the heavens, we first have to empty ourselves in our spirit. We need to unload whatever we have in our spirit. Then we are empty, and the Spirit of truth can come in to unveil the things concerning this wonderful person, Christ, in an absolutely new way.</P><P>During Jesus' time on the earth, Judaism occupied the Jews and filled them up. In the same way today, Christianity is an old religion that has occupied us and is still filling us up. Whenever we talk about the things concerning God, we have many opinions, concepts, and views which are mostly according to tradition. When we talk about how to meet, we may have the concept that we need to be reverent and exercise a certain amount of fear toward God. Even the architecture of the cathedrals built in the Middle Ages&#151;with the steep roofs, stain glass windows, and dark, dim atmosphere&#151;was for creating fear toward God. In such places the people sit in pews, and in the Catholic cathedrals there are places to kneel down. This is the concept of worshipping God in Christianity.</P><P>In John 4, however, the Lord Jesus revealed that the way to worship God is to drink God as the living water (vv. 14, 24). Furthermore, the New Testament reveals the Lord's table as the very central worship we render toward our Triune God. When the Lord established the table, did He tell us to kneel or to prostrate ourselves? What He told us to do was to take and eat the bread, which signifies the body He gave for us. He said to do this in remembrance of Him (1 Cor. 11:23-24). To worship the Lord, to remember Him, is to receive Him into us by eating Him. To remember Him is to eat Him, to masticate Him (John 6:57). To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. This is a new thought concerning the worship we render to the processed Triune God according to the New Testament economy of God. Instead of this new thought, the natural thought of worshipping God, in principle, is within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PREACHING THE GOSPEL AS PRIESTS<br>OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</H2><P>Thus far, after about nineteen centuries of church history, the Lord has not gained His heart's desire. We know that He wants to have a group of people to be His organic members. This means we have to meet organically, serve organically, function organically, and preach the gospel organically. We should not preach the gospel as mere preachers, but as priests. All the preachers of the gospel of God should function as priests. Priests are not common people. If we are going to carry out God's ordained way of preaching the gospel by visiting people, we have to learn to do it as priests. A priest is a person who bears four particular characteristics: he bears God's image to express God; he has God's dominion to represent God; he exercises his spirit to contact and receive God; and he receives God as the tree of life to live God. A priest is a person who is so close to God and according to God's heart. As priests, we are in God and God is in us, so we are one with God. We can go to people with God, bringing God to people. The priestly preaching of the gospel brings God to people and brings people back to God. A priest is also a person who knows God's heart, God's will, God's plan, God's eternal purpose. He is one who can teach people and tell people about God, about what God wants, and about what a man should be before God. This is a priest preaching the gospel, and this priesthood is not just our profession but our life.</P><P>In the Old Testament, the serving by the priests was their daily life. What they ate, how they dressed, and where they lived was part of their priestly service. Their living of the priesthood was their job, their business. A priest serves God by bringing God to man and bringing man back to God. This is the priests' daily life and also their daily job. Today the New Testament believers are all New Testament priests. As such priests, they should always live a life of being one with God to bring God to man and to bring man back to God. Their living becomes their ministry, their work.</P><P>This is why I was so deeply impressed when the Lord showed me Romans 15:16. This verse shows that Paul preached the gospel as a laboring priest of God. He was God's priest to carry out God's gospel. He was not carrying out the priesthood in a light way. He was a laboring priest, a ministering priest. In the Old Testament, God wanted the types of Christ offered to Him. Therefore, the priests daily offered all kinds of sacrifices typifying Christ to God. In the New Testament, God wants the New Testament priests to offer saved sinners to Him as parts of the corporate Christ. All the sinners that we bring to God become Christ's members, parts of the enlarged and corporate Christ. The Old Testament priests offered the types of Christ, but the New Testament priests offer the parts of Christ. In Colossians 1:28 and 29, Paul said that he announced Christ, warning and teaching every man in all wisdom to present every man to God full-grown in Christ. This shows that Paul eventually offered the saved sinners to God full-grown in Christ, as parts of Christ. This is what we should do as priests of the gospel.</P><P>What is revealed in the New Testament concerning the preaching of the gospel is not shallow. All those who preach the gospel must do so as priests. These priests bring God to people and bring people back to God. They offer these people to God as spiritual sacrifices, as parts of the enlarged, corporate Christ. This is what Romans 15:16 reveals.</P><P>First Peter 2:5 and 9 show that Peter had the same thought as Paul. Peter said here that we are living stones being built up into a spiritual house, and this built up spiritual house is the priesthood. The priesthood in these verses refers not to the priestly service but to the priestly body. This is a group of priests built together to be a "hood," a body. This priesthood tells out the virtues of the One who called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. To preach the gospel is to tell out God's virtues. By His virtues we have been called out of darkness into His marvelous light. This was our enjoyment of God Himself as our salvation. Some of His virtues are love, kindness, and mercy. Through God's virtues we were saved in a subjective way, being brought out of darkness into His marvelous light. To tell out these virtues is to bring God to people. If we merely tell people that we are bringing God to them, they may not realize what we are talking about. This is why we must live a life of telling out God's love and mercy to us and of telling out His forgiveness of our sins. We must live such a life. Then we go to people to bring such a God in all His virtues to them.</P><P>When we go to preach the gospel to people, we must exercise our priesthood. We are priests handling God's gospel, which includes everything from the incarnation of the Triune God to the New Jerusalem. We must serve God as priests by handling the entire gospel of God. As priests of the gospel of God, we should first get sinners regenerated. Then as nursing mothers we should nourish and cherish these new ones. We have to nourish and cherish them with the word in the Spirit, ministering life to them. We need to nourish them with the milk of the word. By doing this we help them to grow. Then we can bring them into group meetings so that they can be perfected. This fellowship should show us that whatever is revealed in the New Testament concerning how to serve is altogether different from our natural concept.</P><P>When the Lord's recovery began among us, we gathered from Brother Nee all the studies he had accumulated from church history concerning the New Testament way of Christian service. We practiced what we saw from the New Testament. Then because of the Lord's mercy, we gradually found out that what we were practicing was not so complete. We had many deficiencies. Brother Nee started to restudy the Bible beginning in 1931 for the purpose of seeing more concerning how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach the gospel. In recent years, especially in the last four and a half years, I have also studied the Word concerning these matters. Today I believe that we are here with the result of all our study. We have studied the New Testament book by book, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse. We cannot find any more verses concerning how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach. We have nearly exhausted the study of the New Testament concerning the scriptural way of Christian service. If we are wise and would receive the Lord's mercy, we will see that this is what the Lord wants to do today. This is strategic. This move of the Lord is like a tide.</P><P>We must also realize that the goal of the opposition today is twofold: to oppose the God-ordained way and to smear, to put down, and to put aside my ministry. Dear saints, suppose that today we put the God-ordained way aside and we put this ministry aside. What is left here today if we do this? If we reject the God-ordained way, we have no way to go on. I know that if I do not take this way, my ministry will stop. The Lord showed me this ordained way. If I would not take it or pass it on to the saints, I am finished in the ministry. I have nothing to say. The speaking of God stops in me. I want to convince you not to drop this way or reject this way. I love all of you because you love the Lord and the truth. You have sacrificed a lot to take this way. But I am a little concerned that you might be somewhat influenced to be hesitant about taking the God-ordained way. We must be like the wise merchant mentioned in Matthew 13 who sold everything to buy the pearl of great price.</P><P>When we practice the priestly preaching of the gospel, we are not carrying it out as we did in the past. We need to drop the old way of preaching the gospel. We should not preach in the old way, which is the natural way. We need to preach in the spiritual way. First, we have to know what a priest is and how we can be proper priests. A priest must be one who lives a daily life of revival. He is revived by the Lord every morning, and he participates in and enjoys the Lord's victory every day. We need to be revived in the morning and victorious and overcoming during the day. We also need to help the saints become this kind of revived, overcoming person. This is the daily life of a priest.</P><P>Then we have to realize that the priesthood is for the gospel of God. The first item to practice in the priesthood of the gospel is to visit sinners to get them saved. We need to bring the gospel to them so that they can be regenerated to become parts of Christ. In our old way, we had big gospel meetings and invited people to come to us. These meetings were with one person speaking and the rest listening. Most of us were just the helpers, the Levitical serving ones, who served one great priest, a gifted evangelist. That is the old way, but the God-ordained way is not like this. In the God-ordained way, every believer is a priest of the gospel, going to people with the gospel. The gospel is just God Himself. We go to people to bring God to them and to bring them back to God. After we baptize them, we need to sit down with them to converse with them. We should not use vain words nor should we use too many verses from the Bible. We can use a few verses to impress these new ones that today Christ is the Spirit and that now they have Christ within them, in their spirit. We need to learn this new way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT AND<br>THE WORD TO BE ECSTATIC</H2><P>In principle, every New Testament believer must be "crazy," ecstatic. This is according to the teaching of the New Testament. Ephesians 5 charges us to be filled in our spirit with the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit. Colossians 3 tells us we need to be filled with the word of Christ. We have to be filled with these two elements every day. Both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 say that since we are so full, we will sing and speak in psalms (long poems), hymns (shorter ones), and spiritual songs (the shortest). When we are filled with the word and the Spirit, we are "crazy." It is similar to how a person would feel if he just won a prize of ten million dollars. He would be ecstatic, "crazy." Such a person is different from a formal, religious preacher. In the traditional and religious way of worship, there is no ecstasy, no "craziness," no Spirit, and no word. In this old way, the Spirit is "in the heavens" and the word is in the Bible, but they are not in us. When these two factors&#151;the Spirit and the word&#151;are within us, they make us crazy. We become like an "electrical toy." When the electricity is turned on, the electrical toy becomes "crazy" with electricity. We all need to be crazy people who are electrified by the Spirit and the word.</P><P>When we go to the home of some new believers in this way to have a home meeting with them, we are full of joy. We will be saying, "Amen! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!" When we get there, we will be singing. The new ones may hear us singing outside their door. When we come in, they can join us. Thus, the home meeting started before we arrived at their house. With those who have recently been baptized, we should use the time to impress them that the Lord Jesus is in them. We need to strengthen their understanding of the Lord's presence within them.</P><P>In a home meeting, the wife may ask a question concerning a statue of Buddha in her home. She may say, "Before I was baptized two weeks ago, I was happy whenever I saw that statue. Now I am not happy. What is this?" Then we may respond, "You feel this way because that is an idol, and the Devil is involved with it. He is the enemy of Jesus." Then her husband may ask, "Is this true?" We may say, "Surely it's true. We didn't have a chance to tell you this." Then the husband would make the decision to smash this idol into pieces, and we would encourage him to do so right away. This is an example of what it means to nourish and cherish our spiritual children. Eventually, we can lead the new believers to go with us to another home for a group meeting.</P><P>The ecstatic way, the "crazy" way, will always make people happy. It always cherishes people. The God-ordained way revealed in the Bible saves us from any formality and religious background. But we have to be filled up. We should not go out with a "flat tire." All of our "four tires" must be full of air. We need to be like a ball full of air. If someone touches us, we will "bounce" over them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</H2><P>Now we need to consider how to have the group meetings. As we have said, we Christians should be "crazy" all the time. We should be "crazy" with the Lord, filled up with His Spirit and His word. Then we will attend any meeting in a "crazy" way. We should not go to a meeting like a "flat tire," without being filled with the Spirit and the word. This is why we need to have a new revival every morning so that we can be revived persons. Then we need to continue to exercise our spirit to be overcoming and victorious every day. We need to attend every meeting as revived persons.</P><P>The meeting should actually start before we leave our home. We should go to the group gathering singing and praying. While we are on the way to meet with the saints, we may sing, "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! I have passed the riven veil, Here the glories never fail" (Hymns, #551). When we arrive at the meeting place, what shall we do? According to our old way, we would sit there in silence and wait for the meeting to begin. But the "crazy way" is not like that. We should start the meeting in our home, singing and praying in the car on the way. When we come into the meeting place, we should continue to pray. When others come, they can join our prayer.</P><P>After the prayer, someone may share that a certain brother lost his job today. This is fellowship. Then there can be some prayer for this brother. The fellowship brings in the interceding, the interceding brings in the mutual care, and the mutual care brings in the practical shepherding. After praying for the brother who lost his job, someone may ask what his profession is. Then another brother may say that his company needs such a person. This is an example of mutual care and shepherding. We have to practice this. This will make everyone living. Everyone feels free and has the boldness to share something.</P><P>Following this fellowship and interceding, questions will be asked. No one should be assigned to answer these questions. Everyone should answer them. Someone may ask what the cross is, and a young brother who was saved just three weeks ago can answer this question. He may say, "Formerly I did not know what the cross was. But just recently a brother told me that it was a means used by the Roman government to put to death the worst criminals." His answer is a short teaching. Another brother may continue by saying, "The cross was where the Lord Jesus was crucified. He was crucified there on behalf of us to take away our sins." Then he may read one verse referring to this. Another brother may say, "When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was crucified not only for our sins but also for us." He would also give a verse to support what he has shared. Another brother can add something more by saying, "Today we have to experience the cross of the Lord Jesus. We can experience the cross by applying the death of Christ on the cross to our situation. When we are about to lose our temper, we need to call on the Lord. This brings us into the death of Christ in the Spirit." This brother may then continue to share something further concerning the experience of the cross of Christ.</P><P>A number of questions may be asked in the group meeting. Some will be concerning the truth, and others will be concerning life. In this way there will be the mutual teaching of the truth and the experience of life. This does not mean that we do not need books to help us. We still need the help from books such as Truth Lessons and Life Lessons. In our fellowship with the new ones, we can tell them that it is best to have books like these in our homes so that we can study a part of a lesson when we want to learn something concerning the truth or life. Then when we are in the group meeting, we can refer to these books when we answer something. We can tell the new ones that they can read more concerning a certain truth at home in their spare time. When we take this way, the answers to the questions in the group meeting will become very rich. This way gives the opportunities to every attendant to use their knowledge and their experience to answer questions. If a new believer is brought into a group meeting, and he attends over forty-five group meetings a year, he will learn much truth. All of us start the meeting in our homes, and everyone in the meeting is a leader and a teacher.</P><P>The scriptural basis for the group meetings is in Hebrews 10:24 and 25. When Paul wrote this, he was talking to the Hebrew brothers and telling them not to forsake their own meeting, their Christian meeting. This is because some of the Jewish brothers had left their Christian meeting and had gone back to their Judaistic gathering. In our present situation, we need to have a meeting that is our own meeting. We should not forsake our own meeting. We must help all the saints to realize that the group meeting is their own meeting.</P><P>The group meeting is a meeting of mutuality in which all the saints participate. Everyone can start the meeting in his home, everyone can fellowship, everyone can intercede, and everyone can render the mutual care and the shepherding. In this way everyone in the group will be exercised to shepherd one another. It is impossible for a few elders to shepherd all the saints in the church. But if the church is divided into group meetings, all the saints will shepherd one another. The group meetings are so easy and so delightful. There is no hardship or any heavy burden on anyone. If someone were charged to be the leader of a group meeting, he would have to prepare a teaching to give, and he would be overburdened. But in the organic way, no one is overburdened. Everyone is ecstatic. When a question is raised, we can all answer, listen, and learn.</P><P>Hebrews 10:24 says that we should incite one another to love and good works. It is by this "free way," the organic way, of having group meetings that we can incite one another. In this way there is no limitation, no assignment, and no designation. The meeting is left open to everyone. All the riches of the attending members will come out in the group meetings, and these are the riches of the Body of Christ.</P><P>If a certain brother were charged to take care of a group meeting, probably very few of the saints in the group would pray for that meeting. They would not bear the burden for the meeting because they know that a brother has been assigned to care for it. If this brother has some helpers assigned to him, they may not even help to bear the burden because they know that this brother is bearing the main responsibility. This brother has to consider what kind of lesson he should give. He has to pray to get a subject from the Bible with the help of books like Truth Lessons or Life Lessons. Sometimes such a teacher would be exhausted. He may not know what lesson to choose, what lesson is applicable at that time. When we take the God-ordained way of meeting, however, we leave this matter to the Holy Spirit. The Spirit knows what to cover, and He can be one with the attendants in the meeting to raise the appropriate questions. In one meeting many questions can be asked and properly answered. In the old way, the riches within only one brother are dug out, but in the God-ordained way, everyone has an opportunity to pour out his riches. These are the riches of the Body of Christ. This kind of mutual teaching incites us to love and good works. This is the ecstatic, joyful way to have a group meeting. No one is overburdened because we all bear the burden.</P><P>The group meeting gives everyone the chance to speak. Spontaneously, everyone will participate in the speaking. Humanly speaking, no one can learn a language unless they practice speaking it. By the saints practicing to speak in the group meetings, everyone will learn how to prophesy. It is also profitable for some brothers to act as tutors in helping the saints to prophesy. Perhaps there is a new one among us who has been saved for only six months. A brother who is functioning as a tutor can encourage this new one by telling him not only to speak by answering questions in the group meeting but also to go to the Lord's Day meeting of the church to speak, to prophesy. He can tell this new brother to enlarge and uplift what he has been speaking in the group meeting for a prophecy in the Lord's Day meeting. His speaking will be prophesying with the riches of his experience of Christ or with the riches of his knowledge concerning Christ.</P><P>When we prophesy in the larger meetings of the church, we should not speak too long. Each one should prophesy for no longer than three minutes. The brothers who are tutors can observe the saints who prophesy and help them by coaching them. They can take some time with the saints after the meeting on the Lord's Day to give them some helpful adjustments. This is like a coach teaching the players. One thing we need to remember for all of our meetings is that we need to be "crazy" with and in the Spirit and the word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRACTICAL POINTS CONCERNING THE WAY TO GO ON</H2><P>I would like to say a word to the elders. In our locality we should not do anything in haste. At the present time, some of the saints may not feel good about changing our way of meeting from one person speaking to a meeting of mutuality with all prophesying. They may be concerned that nothing will come out if we begin to meet in mutuality and that this will result in a drop in attendance. We need to consider the situation of the saints in our locality. We have to fellowship with the saints who are concerned and with the whole church. We also have to help the prophesying in the larger church meetings. The elders need to do a supporting work. If the church is having a prophesying meeting and nothing substantial comes out in forty minutes, the elders need to take the last fifteen minutes to speak a word to the saints. When we first begin to take the way of meeting in mutuality, this may be needed. A word from the leading ones in the final fifteen minutes will fill in the gap. The elders should exercise to be very flexible in bringing the church into this God-ordained way of meeting. As long as we have a will, there is a way. We have the Bible and many spiritual books that open up the Bible. These can help us to get ourselves prepared to give a word full of the riches of Christ. In some meetings there may be no need for the elders to supply something special to support the meeting. But when we begin to take this way of meeting, the elders and certain gifted ones need to get themselves prepared and need to be on the alert to supply a word full of the riches of Christ if the meeting is empty. This God-ordained way will open up the mine for the riches of Christ to be released.</P><P>Every group meeting is a digging meeting, and every district meeting, the larger meeting of the church, is a meeting to exhibit, to display, the riches. If we have fifty meeting together on the Lord's Day, I believe five will be very rich. They will always have some riches in their pocket. If the others in the meeting do something to support and to supply the meeting, that is sufficient. If they do not, some of the rich ones can function to make up the lack. Therefore, no meeting will be empty.</P><P>It would be very difficult for other Christian groups to take the way of all speaking in mutuality. The Bible has not been opened up among them, and they have very few books to help them get into the riches of the Bible. But with us it is different. Many of the brothers and sisters in the recovery have the riches of Christ, and they have the capacity to release these riches for the building up of the Body. They need to be given the opportunity to practice to release their riches. If we will be faithful to take the Lord's ordained way, I believe that all the local churches will be brought on the right track within ten years. By that time the "custom" of the new way will be built up in the Lord's recovery.</P><P>Furthermore, we should not despise anyone or any church if they do not fully practice the ordained way. Criticism and gossip obviously are absolutely not from the Spirit. Whether a brother or sister takes this way or not, they are still in the hand of the Lord. Whether a church takes this way or not should be left to the Lord. All of the churches and all of the saints are members of the Body of Christ in the recovery. Whether someone takes this way or not should not concern us. But since we have seen something, we should be faithful to practice what we have seen.</P><P>We must also realize that the gifted persons have to perfect the saints. The best way and the best place to perfect the saints is in the group meetings. If you are a gifted person, you should go to a group meeting to perfect the saints in that group. When you are with them, you can observe them and get to know everyone's condition. Then you can not only perfect them in the meetings but also perfect them outside the meetings by going to be with them. Paul said in Acts 20 that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house (v. 20) and that he admonished each one with tears (v. 31). He taught the saints not only in the big meetings but also in the homes and one by one. This is a detailed, fine work. It takes much labor and time. If I am a person who has the portion, the capacity, and the gift to perfect the saints, I should attend a group meeting all the time. As everyone speaks in the group meeting, I will get to know their real situation. Then I can go to their homes to spend personal time with them. Perhaps I could visit one person each week to have a direct talk with each one of them. This is for the purpose of promoting each one's gifts, to develop his capacity, and to enrich his speaking. We can render much tutoring by this one-on-one contact. In this way the saints will be perfected face to face by some of the gifted persons. This labor will not be in vain because some saints will be perfected. Eventually, the saints will be perfected to do what the gifted persons do. Furthermore, the gifted persons will produce gifted persons.</P><P>In the old way, there was not such a result because the way was wrong. In this producing way, we all learn to do something and to share something, and we will fully use our capacity to function. Then the riches of Christ will come out of every member of His Body. We will perfect one another, and everyone will be perfected. It may be that in a five-year period, we will perfect someone. But after this, he will perfect us because he has learned more. By this God-ordained way, everyone will be perfected, everyone will be useful, and everyone will have the development of his capacity in the divine life. Every saint will be occupied, and no time, energy, or persons will be wasted. The numbers will increase, and the life and spiritual knowledge will grow. We need to cooperate with our Lord to take His ordained way to organically build up the Body of Christ.</P></body></html>
