   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 20:22; Rom 8:2, 10, 6b, 11; 2 Cor 3:6b, 17-18; Rev 1:4-5; 4:5; 5:6 THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit for God's dispensing, so that God can dispense Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By these two items, God dispenses Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The way for God to dispense Himself into His chosen people is for Him to first embody Himself in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Son came, He came with the Father and by the Spirit, so He was the embodiment of the Triune God while He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God, is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this way God dispenses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Gospel of John, God is in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then this God became flesh John 1:14 , and this man, who was the last Adam, lived on this earth thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, and was buried.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the day of His resurrection He came back to the disciples as the Spirit because He breathed Himself into the disciples and charged them to receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the beginning of the Gospel of John is God and at the end is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In between what is revealed is that the Son came with the Father by the Spirit and died and resurrected to be realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Son is realized as the Spirit, the Spirit reaches the disciples as the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaches us to be our life, to be our life supply, and to be our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This Spirit is the compound of God and man plus the processes the Triune God has gone through including incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these became elements compounded in this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When this Spirit entered into us, all these positive items entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When this all-inclusive Spirit dwells in us, all these positive items dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we have this Spirit, we have God and we have the uplifted and glorified humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have the proper and normal human living, the effectiveness of the all-inclusive death of Jesus, and the power of the surpassing resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because we have this all-inclusive Spirit, we are short of nothing and have all that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 14:26 says that the Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then John 15:26 tells us that the Son sends the Spirit with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Father sent the Spirit and the Son also sent the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These two verses show us two senders and one sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The two senders are the Father and the Son, and the sent one is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For the Father to send the Spirit in the Son's name means that the Father sent the Spirit as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Father sent the Spirit as the Son, and the Son also sent the Spirit with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that the Spirit comes as the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Spirit comes, the Son comes and the Father comes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All three come.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit breathed into the disciples at the end of John is the totality of the Triune God, the aggregate of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you have the Spirit, you have the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some teach that the "Holy Ghost" is merely the power, the means, or the instrument for God to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To these teachers when the Holy Ghost comes, the Father stays in the heavens, and the Son is sitting at the right hand of the Father in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the Bible's teaching is absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible teaches that when the Son comes, He comes with the Father and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit comes as the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the Spirit comes as the Son, whatever the Son has gone through, whatever the Son has accomplished, whatever the Son has obtained, and whatever the Son has attained are all here with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you have the Spirit, you have the Son with all the processes He has gone through and all His accomplishments, obtainments, and attainments.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have the Son's person, the Son's work, the Son's humanity, the Son's human living, the Son's death, and the Son's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because the Spirit comes with the Father, what the Father is, has, can do, is doing, and will do are all here with the Spirit.</S>
