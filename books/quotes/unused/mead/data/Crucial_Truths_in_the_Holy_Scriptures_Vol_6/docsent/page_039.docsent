   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Death of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first suffering of death is related to the death of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Originally, the human spirit was living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as our ears can understand and contact sound and our eyes can differentiate and contact color, the human spirit can know and understand matters concerning God and fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, man s spirit was deadened, and it lost the function and blessing of knowing and contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This suffering can be compared to the experience of a deaf person who is unable to hear or a blind person who is unable to see.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the day that you eat of it you shall surely die Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God told Adam that he would die in the day that he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when Adam ate of the fruit, he did not die outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, God s word must have referred to the deadening of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he disobeyed God s commandment, the function of his human spirit died, cutting him off from God and causing him to lose the blessing and ability of knowing God, contacting God, and fellowshipping with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let the dead bury their own dead Matt 8:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse speaks of two kinds of dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first are dead in the spirit but not in body, and the second are dead in both spirit and body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the first kind can bury the second.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though the first can bury those who are physically dead, they themselves are still dead because their spirit is dead in its function of contacting and fellowshipping with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the outward body is living, the inward spirit is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, both kinds of people are dead in God s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every person who does not believe is dead and is in death because his spirit is dead, having been cut off from God and being unable to contact and fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When such a one hears the voice of the Son of God, the gospel that gives life, his spirit is made alive, and he is able to contact God in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, he passes out of death into life.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In God s eyes every person who is saved was dead prior to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the day of his salvation he is enlivened, and God no longer considers such a one as being dead but rather as living again.</S>
