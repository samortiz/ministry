   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Example 2: Hymns, #578 My will is weak, my strength is frail,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And all my hope is nearly gone;</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I can but trust Thy working true</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To gently hold and lead me on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I've tried my best, but still have failed,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>E'en as before I've failed and erred;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thy patience is my only trust</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To hold and keep me to Thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whene'er my heart is lifted up,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How very near I am to fall;</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I dare not do, I dare not think,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I need Thyself in great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Though I'm the weakest of the weak,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My strength is nothing but Thy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a good hymn directed toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"My will is weak, my strength is frail."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Inwardly the will is weak, while outwardly the strength is frail.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Inwardly one wants to will, but he is too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Outwardly he wants to do something, but he is too frail.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He can neither will nor run.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus "all my hope is nearly gone."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What else can he do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He can only "trust Thy working true."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At first the writer was talking to himself, but now he turns to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He comes to God and looks to Him "to gently hold and lead me on."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that other than the Lord's gentle step-by-step leading, he now has no more hope.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is where he stands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Following this, we have the next line: "I've tried my best, but still have failed."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not preaching; this is poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"E'en as before I've failed and erred."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Thy patience is my only trust."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He trusts in the Lord's patience to do what?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"To hold and keep me to Thy word."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He has no other hope.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His only hope is in the Lord's power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is His power that holds and keeps him in obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He sees himself as being completely hopeless; he is clear about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the third stanza, we see a man of God climbing slowly upward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Whene'er my heart is lifted up" this means whenever he is slightly proud and self-appreciating only very slightly "How very near I am to fall."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has had too much of such experiences already.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should he do now?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"I dare not do, I dare not think."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He dares not do anything; he even dares not think anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"I need Thyself in great or small" this means that he needs the Lord in everything and in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here is a person whose sentiments have thoroughly passed through the refining fire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are not harsh before God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every word is poetry and full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every word touches God and God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, a person who knows himself does not remain in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, he has to pray to God, "Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,/O Lord, I come to seek Thy face."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have no way, no hope, nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I can only come to seek after You.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Though I'm the weakest of the weak" here he refers back to stanza one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He does not end abruptly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My will is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>My strength is frail.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I cannot will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I cannot run.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am the weakest of the weak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"My strength is nothing but Thy grace."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's grace is all that he needs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is this grace that enables him to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If our feelings are tested and refined, every time we come to God and touch such a divinely tested and refined hymn, our feeling cannot help but be caught up in it.</S>
