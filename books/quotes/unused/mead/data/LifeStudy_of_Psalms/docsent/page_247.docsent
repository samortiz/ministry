   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Early Rain Covering</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Valley of Weeping with Blessings</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 6c says, "Indeed the early rain covers it with blessings."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to our experience, this means that our tears become a spring and that this spring becomes the early rain that covers the valley with blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This early rain is the Spirit, and the Spirit is our blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the situation with a certain brother in Cheefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before he believed in the Lord Jesus, he was a Moslem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After he was saved and came into the church life, he suffered a great deal of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This persecution nearly killed him, and he shed many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But those tears became a spring; the spring became the Spirit as the early rain; and as a result this brother was very living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who come into the church life by passing through the valley of weeping will find that this weeping eventually becomes a great blessing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This blessing is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The tears they shed are their own, but these tears become a spring, which becomes the early rain, the Spirit as the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>E. Going from Strength to Strength</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"They go from strength to strength" v. 7a . This indicates that strength is added to strength.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who take the highway to Zion already have strength in God, and now they are strengthened further and thus go from strength to strength.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>F. To Appear before God in Zion</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Each appears before God in Zion" v. 7b . The issue of the foregoing is that we appear before God in Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We treasure God's habitation because Zion is here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We treasure the church life because here we are in Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though we are on earth, we are nonetheless in the heavenly Zion Heb 12:22 .</S>
