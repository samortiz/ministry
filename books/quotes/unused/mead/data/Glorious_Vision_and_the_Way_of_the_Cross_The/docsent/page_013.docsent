   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lead us into Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us meet, touch, enjoy, and gain You in it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Be with us again this morning in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We pray that You will open Yourself to us so that every day we can pick up what You want us to learn here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We want to be like Paul who said that he had learned the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>O Lord, remember us, and remember these young brothers and sisters that they would learn this secret from their youth, which is to be able to do everything in Him who empowers us.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We pray that Your blood will cleanse and cover us again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>EXPLANATION OF HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to consider again the humanity of one who serves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word ren-ger in Chinese, which we translate as humanity, is a word that is hard to define.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The definitions vary according to different dictionaries and lexicons; there are different explanations of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to what I know, there is even a legal definition of the word; it refers to a man's position and rights.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Legally speaking, to lose one's ren-ger, or humanity, is to lose his position and rights as a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, this is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to my experience and observation, humanity refers to what a person is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This intrinsic being of a person eventually becomes a form that expresses itself before men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not easy to find an equivalent word for ren-ger in English.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The closest word may be personality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this word only refers to the character of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is still somewhat different from what a person is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Humanity emphasizes the outward expression; "personality" emphasizes the inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Usually, whatever is within a man is expressed outwardly in a certain way or form.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore these two aspects are very close.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One is inward and the other is outward.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Inwardly it is the personality and outwardly it is the humanity.</S>
