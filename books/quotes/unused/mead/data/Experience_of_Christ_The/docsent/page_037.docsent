   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the fellowship of Christ's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sufferings here are different from our common sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most of our sufferings are not Christ's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To know the fellowship of Christ's sufferings, we must know the difference between Christ's sufferings and our common sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ's sufferings were for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ did not suffer for any other reason.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We, on the contrary, suffer not because we are fulfilling God's will, but because we have made so many mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose, for example, a certain brother is quite lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By oversleeping in the morning, he misses the bus for school.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because he is late for school, he suffers discipline at school upon his arrival.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such suffering is not the suffering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the suffering that comes upon us because of our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to be clear what the sufferings of Christ are.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose a brother who is a student has a genuine, living testimony at school.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This testimony causes him to be persecuted for the sake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This persecution is the suffering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To remain in this kind of suffering is to share in the fellowship of Christ's suffering for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The suffering that comes from being persecuted for bearing a living testimony to the Lord is in the same category as Christ's suffering for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all must stay in this kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever you repudiate your flesh and your self, you will experience Christ and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But due to your enjoyment of Christ, opposition will come to you, and you will suffer persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You will be persecuted because the world today is against God's economy and the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you suffer opposition and persecution, you share in the fellowship of Christ's suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BEING CONFORMED TO CHRIST'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this verse Paul also speaks of being conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ's humanity was like a shell, and He as the embodiment of God was concealed and confined within this shell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Outwardly He had no glory, but inwardly He was filled with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How could the glory within shine out?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The only way was by death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ's death was the breaking of the outer shell of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through His death, His human shell was broken, and the divine glory was released.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, His death broke His humanity and released His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As human beings, we also have our humanity as a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our shell, of course, is not pure, as Christ's was.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we have been born again, the divine life is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, it is concealed within this shell of our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we need to experience the kind of death that breaks the shell of our humanity and releases the glory of the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this to take place, we need to be conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ's death is the death that breaks the human shell and releases the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need such a death day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we repudiate our flesh and all that we are by nature, Christ remains within as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we enjoy Christ, we must be prepared to experience the death that breaks our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From this kind of death there is no escape.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The death of Adam is terrible, but the death of Christ is lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we all must love the death of Christ and be willing to be conformed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Each day as I experience Christ, the experience of Christ brings me into a situation of death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This death situation, however, is lovable and not dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even God loves the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This situation of death may involve our wife or husband or the elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By experiencing this death, the natural man that we have already repudiated and set aside is killed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At times Christ may seem to say, "Since you have repudiated your flesh, let Me kill it."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This killing is the conformity to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually, we shall be fully conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At that time, others will be able to see in us and upon us the working of death that kills our flesh, self, and natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This death breaks the outer shell and releases the inward glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of the five points covered in this message are part of the detailed way to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we experience these five items, we shall one day attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We shall cover this matter in a later message.</S>
