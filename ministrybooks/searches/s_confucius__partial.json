Actually, followers of Confucius never formally assert that theirs is a religion. Confucianism merely exercises great influence on Chinese culture, education, ethics, and philosophy. One thing, however, is certain: the teachings and doctrines of Confucius are of foremost importance, while the person Confucius is not as crucial. I do not mean that Confucianism has no concern for Confucius. The man indeed was an extraordinary person. However, in order to be a part of Confucianism, one only needs to understand the doctrines of Confucius, abide by his teachings, and be thoroughly acquainted with his books. It does not matter whether one understands the man Confucius or not. The principles, doctrines, and teachings of Confucius are the essence of the religion.

Once He asked His disciples, \u201cWho do you say that I am?\u201d Over and over again He demanded that His disciples believe in Him. He said that he who believes in the Son has eternal life. Again He said, \u201cHe who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me\u201d (Matt. 10:37). Unless a man loves in this way, he is not worthy to be His disciple. Words such as these have been uttered only by Him. No other religious leader ever said anything like that. Confucius never said to Yen-weh or Tze-lu, \u201cBelieve in me,\u201d nor did he ever say, \u201cLove me.\u201d Neither did any of the other leaders, such as Sakya Muni or Mohammed, demand of their disciples faith in them.

Confucius did mention God a few times in his writings, calling Him the King of the heavens, or even the heavens. Even though Confucius mentioned God, his teachings are ethical, not religious. Therefore, Buddhism is nonsensical, Taoism is vain, and the teachings of Confucius are ethical.

When you do this, you are outside of your spirit; you are in the improper functioning of your lusts, emotions, and mind. But on the other hand, [65] while you are doing this, you sense an inner voice condemning you, even forbidding and criticizing you. Sometimes after you have stolen something, you feel uneasy using it. This feeling of uneasiness is not from any outward religious or ethical teaching.

Our life is fragile, but His life is transcendent. In Him is life (1:4); only He is life. This word spoken by Him is truly high and great.

What the Lord Jesus is, is the bread of life, the water of life, and the light of life. Therefore, often when He opened His mouth, He referred to these things. Men do not have these concepts in their mentality, so they cannot speak them. About two hundred years ago a French philosopher said that if the Jesus recorded in the four Gospels was a fabrication, then the fabricator was qualified to be Jesus. This is because the words spoken by Jesus were unparalleled before that time or since then. This is especially true in the matter of life. Therefore, His disciples testified, \u201cIn Him was life, and the life was the light of men\u201d (John 1:4).

However, the Lord Jesus said, \u201cI am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\u201d (8:12).

Thus, man\u2019s life should come under God\u2019s life. It should even submit to God\u2019s life unto death. Philippians 2 shows us that the man Jesus humbled Himself and obeyed unto death, even the death of the cross (v. 8). His death, that is, the death on the cross, was a laying aside of Himself. He did not act according to man\u2019s will but to God\u2019s will (Matt. 26:39). Today our Christian life is the same. We should be obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, without self-choosing, desire, inclination, or enjoyment, instead, seeking only God and His will.

This brightness in one\u2019s heart is the function of the conscience, which is a part of the human spirit. Even though Confucian scholars speak of the bright virtue within man, they do not speak very clearly concerning it.

To set the mind on the flesh is to focus our attention on outward things; to set the mind on the spirit is to be focused inwardly. The direction of our entire being should be adjusted and readjusted all the time by our continually turning within rather than without. According to God\u2019s creation, man\u2019s spirit is a treasure. This treasure is in us. Everything that is focused on outward things will fail.

The church in Jerusalem can be considered the \u201cbig brother\u201d among all the churches. Christ once ministered there, and the twelve apostles labored there for a long time. Even the gospel spread out from the Christians in Jerusalem. Many Christians were produced through Jerusalem. Later, after Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch from their first mission, they faced a great trial; some from the church in Jerusalem came to Antioch and taught that all believers had to be circumcised according to the law of Moses and that if they were not circumcised, they were not saved. Paul and Barnabas debated with them fiercely. The two were clear that if a man who believes in Christ cannot be justified and remains a sinner, it means that Christ has died for nothing (Gal. 2:17-21). For this reason, the church can never mix salvation with things of the Jewish background, including circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, and ordinances related to eating, etc. If such things were allowed to mix with salvation, other teachings would eventually come in. A man would be told that he could not be saved unless he did other things, such as obtain a university degree or practice vegetarianism, etc. In China, if the teaching of Confucius is allowed to come in, many will say that a man cannot be saved unless he honors his parents or practices universal compassion, etc. But this is not the gospel of Christ. The gospel says that [396] anyone can believe in the Lord and be saved. The teaching that one can only be saved through keeping the law came from Jerusalem. Therefore, Paul and Barnabas had to go up to Jerusalem to fellowship with the church. They were not the only ones. Other brothers from the church in Antioch also went with them.

Within the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are good, evil, and knowledge. These things, together with the death that comes with them, [476] are included in this tree. The skill that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil renders is the ability to know, and the end is death. But the tree of life is God, and the end is God coming to us as life. Once God comes forth, and man touches Him, he has life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is something entirely outside of God. The result of touching this tree is surely death. As a Christian we are revived. Before we were revived, we touched evil. Now that we are revived, we touch good. But whatever we touch, we are still touching the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Please remember that good and evil belong to the same tree. Neither good nor evil belongs to life. The acts of the Chinese bandits are, of course, not life. But the virtuous acts of the Chinese sages such as Confucius, Mencius, and Wang Yang-ming are not life either.

Followers of Confucius talk about developing and magnifying the bright virtue, but the Bible says that God is the Creator, the source, of every virtue and that He is the reality of every virtue. Hence, man must receive God as his content, reality, and life so that God can express His attributes in and through man\u2019s virtues. Our human virtues can be compared to a glove; God\u2019s attributes can be compared to a hand. Our human virtues should contain and express God\u2019s attributes.

I do not like that kind of skin coloring, for it makes me think of the work of a mortician, who tries to make the face of a dead person appear as attractive as possible.
