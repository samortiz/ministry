   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This life does not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God sees this life, He reckons us as righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ's resurrection not only imparts a new life to us; it also hides our life with Christ in God Col 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the subjective side, Christ as our life is dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We received this at the time of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This life is the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the objective side, we appear before God in Christ and have a new position so that God sees us just as He sees Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way God sees Christ is the same way He sees us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, when we come before God's presence, we do not have to tremble.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we appear before God in Christ, nothing is more beautiful than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hymn #299, stanzas 3 and 4 say,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So nigh, so very nigh to God,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I cannot nearer be;</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For in the person of His Son</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am as near as He.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So dear, so very dear to God,</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once there is a hole in the conscience, faith leaks out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we pray and our conscience is under accusation, our faith is weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our justification by the blood resolves our problem with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God looks upon us as though we have no sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our justification by resurrection means that Christ has become our life within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We occupy a new position in Christ before God, the position which Christ occupies before God.</S>
