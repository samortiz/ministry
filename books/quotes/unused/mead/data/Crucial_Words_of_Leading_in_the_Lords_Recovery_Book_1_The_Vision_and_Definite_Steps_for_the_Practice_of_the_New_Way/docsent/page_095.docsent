   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADDITIONAL POINTS REGARDING THE TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have included some language classes in the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is for the preparation of the gospelization of Taiwan and the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After we have gospelized the island of Taiwan, some full-timers will be sent abroad, in particular to South America, Africa, Australasia, Japan, and Korea.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, they will need to learn the respective languages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, for the purpose of understanding the Bible and reading the reference materials, they will need to learn Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have invited teachers from different places to come, so that on the one hand, they can teach the trainees different languages, and on the other hand, they can live the church life here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is killing two birds with one stone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning the furnishing of the training center, everything should be simple, dignified, and harmonious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There must be some who would specifically manage affairs and finance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we will have the full-time training every year, we must set up a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the Lord wills, after the meeting hall in Lin-ko is completed, we will move the training center there, and it will be on a larger scale.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must now establish a good foundation so that there will be no difficulties in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope that all the churches will try their best to encourage the young people to join the full-time training and help in handling the applications.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not insist on my own view.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you want to have a full-time training in your own locality, you may do so, but I would rather that you do it together with some other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way, the teaching staff and the content of the classes will be enriched and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This also saves much energy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are two terms of training in a year, with each term lasting four months.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the remaining months in the year, the trainees can return to their respective localities to help and strengthen the churches, or they may stay in Taipei to propagate in the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will further strengthen the steps we take for the propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CONCERNING EXPENSES FOR THE TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the churches must bear the burden to share the expenses for the training.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In principle, one full-timer should be produced out of twenty people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Owing to different circumstances, some churches may not have suitable young people to send to the full-time training, but they should still be faithful in the matter of financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In contrast, some churches or halls may have many students that can be produced as full-timers but have some difficulties in the matter of support; other churches and halls should make up this lack.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If all the churches in Taiwan are one and all the saints endeavor together in one accord, producing as many full-timers as possible and giving as much as possible, the Lord s grace will enable us to reach our goal of having one thousand full-timers to evangelize Taiwan in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FELLOWSHIP REGARDING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE MEETING HALL IN LIN-KO</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are producing a model in Taipei for spreading the gospel to the entire island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our basic principle is to build up the church in the believers homes so that the preaching of the gospel, the teaching of the truth, and the edifying of the saints are in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, Christians still need big meetings, because the atmosphere of the big meetings can never be replaced by small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, we need a big meeting hall that can afford us a place for corporate meetings once a month and can be used on a regular basis for the long-term training.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once the meeting hall in Lin-ko is completed, it will have an occupancy of fifteen thousand so that saints from various localities can take turns to come and have corporate meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the principle in the Old Testament, God ordained that His people gather in Jerusalem three times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was very helpful to the establishment and unity of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the church is built up only in the homes, the building will be scattered, and the saints as a whole will not be able to join and blend with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, there is the need for a big meeting to join and blend the saints together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, some high-peak truths cannot be released from house to house through the ministry; rather, they need to be released in the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The release of the high-peak truths in the big meetings will become the truth lessons for the saints to mutually teach and ask questions in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, international conferences and trainings can also be held in Lin-ko.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will blend the churches on the earth into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the meeting hall in Lin-ko is not merely for the need in Taiwan but for the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All that we are doing is beneficial to our country.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our effort to bring the gospel and truth to the homes to gospelize, truthize, and churchize Taiwan is the real reformation of the people s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This will have a far-reaching influence on people s morality and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the meeting hall in Lin-ko is finished, it will be used as the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Like a factory, the training will be very profitable for the building up of our nation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, all the saints should pray much that the government will have the foresight to approve our request to build.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The budget for the construction of the meeting hall in Lin-ko is around NT 400 million approximately US 13 million .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The need for the full-time training and propagation is about the same amount.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It will be too heavy for the churches in Taiwan to bear the entire burden.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that the saints from overseas, especially the churches in the United States, will share this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This requires much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In terms of priority, the full-time training and propagation should be given priority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The move of gospelizing Taiwan will begin in January of 1988, but the construction of the meeting hall in Lin-ko depends on the approval of the government and the giving of the saints; thus, it may take some time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THREE CRUCIAL MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I hope that when the co-workers and elders go back to their localities, they will fellowship with the saints regarding these three great schedules, plans, and needs: first, there is the support and quota for the full-timers and the financial need; second, there is the expenses of the full-time training and propagation; and third, there is the need for the construction of the meeting hall in Lin-ko.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although the full-time training is in Taipei, the full-time trainees come from all over Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After they are trained, they will be for the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, this financial burden should be shared by all the churches in Taiwan and not borne exclusively by the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I hope the brothers will encourage the saints to rise up to respond to these three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we succeed in these three matters, the Lord s recovery will have a broad way on the earth, and the prospect of the Lord s recovery will surpass our expectation.</S>
