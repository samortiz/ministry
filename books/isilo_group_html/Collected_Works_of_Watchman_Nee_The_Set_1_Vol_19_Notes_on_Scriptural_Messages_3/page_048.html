God loves man, and He loves to forgive man's sins. Therefore, from the time man sinned, God sought ways to redeem man from his sins.</P><P>In the Old Testament God used the blood of bulls and goats to redeem man from his sins. In the New Testament He appointed the Lord Jesus, who is the Lamb of God, to be the sacrifice for sin. In offering up Himself, man is forever redeemed from his sins. On God's side, the blood shed on the cross by the Lord Jesus has completely solved the problem of man's sin. But on man's side, there is another condition-faith. Whoever believes that the blood of the Lord Jesus is shed for his sins is redeemed, and his sins are forgiven. Whoever does not believe will perish and his destiny will be hell. However, the work of redemption is complete, and it is of God. It was initiated by God, a work that God wanted to do. God has done this work; He has sacrificed His only begotten Beloved and paid such a price. Therefore, there is no problem to prevent God from forgiving man's sin to redeem man from his sins. O sinners, are you still fearful that your sins will not be taken care of? Are you still afraid that your sins will not be forgiven? God will forgive you; He is willing to forgive you, and He has paid a great price to forgive you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD BEING ABLE TO FORGIVE MAN'S SINS</H2><P>As soon as a sinner believes that the blood of the Lord Jesus was shed on the cross for his sins, his sins are forgiven. If a believer is by chance overcome by sin, he only needs to repent sincerely and confess his sins before God (1 John 1:9). Such confession will bring about forgiveness. The worth of the Lord Jesus' blood is so great that all of man's sins can be forgiven and he can be cleansed from all unrighteousness. Therefore, there is a way to take care of sins, both in the sinners as well as in the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD FOREVER FORGIVING MAN'S SINS</H2><P>Once the Lord Jesus told Peter to forgive others seventy times seven times. This means that one should continually and forever forgive. As long as a person turns and repents, his sins will be forgiven. Since the Lord taught Peter such a word of grace, is it possible that He would not practice it Himself? This is impossible; He will forgive a sorrowful and repentant sinner, and He will forgive him every time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S FORGIVENESS LEAVING NO TRACE</H2><P>Many people think that committing a sin is like copying a wrong letter, whereas being forgiven of sin is like the erasure of that wrong letter which still leaves an indelible mark on the page. They do not realize that this does not match the fact of God's forgiveness. The blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses man from his sins. What is the meaning of cleansing? It means to be washed to the extent that no trace of blemish or spot is left; it is as if the person had never sinned and is as holy as Christ. Isaiah 1:18 says, "Come now and let us reason together,/Says Jehovah./Though your sins are like scarlet,/They will be as white as snow;/Though they are as red as crimson,/They will be like wool." Snow and wool do not have a speck of red in them. Therefore, when God washes man of his sins, he becomes absolutely clean, and no trace of sin is left.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S HEART OF FORGIVENESS BEING MORE THAN<br>OUR DESIRE FOR FORGIVENESS</H2><P>The actions of the prodigal son's father in Luke 15 show us the forgiving heart of our heavenly Father. While the prodigal son was on his way home, the father saw him and went out to meet him. The old man was not walking slowly but was running toward the son. The father was eager to see his son, and he considered walking to be too slow. As a result, he ran. God's "feet" of forgiveness toward a repentant sinner are also swift. He only wishes He could forgive man of his sins sooner. Did the prodigal son run to his father? No, he did not run. In the movement of the two persons, we see that the forgiving heart of the father was greater than the desire for forgiveness in the son. As we read on, the father's kiss and his embraces tell us that God is most pleased and happy with a sinner who turns back. The son was still remorseful about his past sins and felt that he had sinned against heaven and against his father, but as he was confessing to his father, the father could not contain himself out of his earnest love for the son. He could not wait and did not wait for the son to finish his words. (In Luke 15:18-19, there are five phrases of confession, but in verse 21 only four phrases were spoken; the last one was interrupted by the father.) The father ordered the servants to bring in the best robe and the ring and put them on the son. Oh, our heavenly Father's forgiving heart is greater than our desire for forgiveness. We do not have to weep for three days and three nights, confessing our sins over and over again before we can be forgiven. Many times we confess our sins over and over; we weep again and again, thinking that we can only be forgiven if we buffet ourselves once again. Oh, we have misunderstood God's heart; we have caused His heart pain. We have to realize that He loves those whom He has purchased even more than we love ourselves. He is most eager to forgive us; He "runs" to forgive us. He does not wait for us to finish our confession before He has already forgiven us!</P><P>Many times in our homes the ones we love offend us. Do we not eagerly wait to forgive them? If they apologize a little from their heart and say a little word of apology, do we not forgive them right away? Wherever there is love, there is a forgiving heart. If this is true with earthly relationships, how much more is it true with the Father in heaven, who is full of love and mercy? Will He not eternally and completely forgive man of his sins?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
