   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOURISHING PEOPLE IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As soon as a person rises up from baptism, you need to have a long time of fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is his first home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I suggest that you talk to him about the Lord being the life-giving Spirit and being one spirit with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You should tell him, The Jesus whom you have believed in has become the life-giving Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally, He was God becoming the flesh on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But for the bearing of our sins, He died on the cross for us and shed His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After He died and was buried, He resurrected again after three days to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Spirit is just like the air; He is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although He cannot be touched or seen, He is more real than everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone needs Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, this Spirit is personified; that is, He is a person, a divine person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is why if you call on Him today, He will enter into you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, when God created us, He created us with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only do we have an outward body; we have a soul within also.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Inside the soul, there is a spirit, which is our innermost person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today, this pneumatic Lord has entered into our spirit and has regenerated our spirit, so that the two spirits are now one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now your calling and praying must be from this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Following this, you can lead him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By then, he may feel ashamed of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You can then lead him to confess his sins to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as a person is willing to confess his sins, everything will work out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is like a person who has taken the wrong kind of food into the stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the wrong food is vomited out and the stomach is cleared, everything will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a person has vomited out all his sins, the result is the filling up of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With all these words, you have enough to talk about for the first home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After this, you should set up an appointment for the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Preferably, it should be within the next one or two days.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason for this is that newborn babies need special care.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before you go to his home the second time, you should first pray at home, and you should confess your sins thoroughly and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While you are on your way, you should sing along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The best song to sing is the one you taught him the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he hears your singing from within his house, he will join in as soon as he greets you, and the home meeting begins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This home meeting does not begin at his home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, it begins from your home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is what we mean by being organic.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After you sing a few times, spontaneously, you can utter a simple prayer, Lord, how we praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are all rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our brother is happy, and we are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is Your grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no need for religious prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to turn our prayers into a kind of ordinary speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Following that, he may open his mouth to say, Yesterday evening I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was really marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But this morning, while I was rejoicing, suddenly I began to feel sad.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a question that has to do with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It also has to do with life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If two have come to his house, you may not necessarily be the first to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The other one can first answer the question, According to my experience, when I am happy and there suddenly comes a sad feeling, often it is the Lord speaking to me that I have a problem within.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You can pray to the Lord and ask Him why you are not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Gradually, you will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After he says this, you can add some more to show him that this is the Lord trying to point out something within.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For that reason, he should pray more to the Lord, so that the Lord will reveal Himself clearly to him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, some have cheated their companies before they believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They have coveted some money.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Later, the Lord was shining on them and gave them a feeling towards this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They would then pray and would ask the Lord for strength and courage to confess the transgression and to return the money.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When he obeys this way, he will feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some may have hidden away items like an image of Buddha.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord causes him to remember these things, and when he moves them out of his house, he will be filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This kind of fellowship has, on the one hand, the teaching of the truth and, on the other hand, the leading in life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this way, he will be helped to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The home meeting does not need to have a set topic.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A question that a new one raises can become a topic.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the new ones are not very aggressive in asking questions, you can ask them questions instead.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, you can ask them if they have prayed in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This question will bring out many more questions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As for ourselves, first, we need to have some foundation in the Bible, some edification in the truth, and we need to love the Lord and have the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only then will we know the others condition, and only then will we be able to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are all going on the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have walked through it ahead of you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Now I am leading you on in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we go to the meeting, we are not going to a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everything has to be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This requires practice.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What I have just spoken is not imaginary.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I have experienced these things and they have proved to be effective, powerful, and far-reaching.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After you leave the new ones, they will begin to experience something according to what you have instructed them to do.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When you come back the next time, they will say, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What you told us the last time was really right.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now I feel very refreshed within.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Based on this, you can go on to say something more: This feeling of refreshment is there because the sins within you are removed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now the Lord has the ground within you, and He can now move in you.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>From now on, in your daily life, whatever you do, whether things great or small, you have to follow the sense of the Lord within you.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This sense is the sense of the spirit and the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In this way, you have given him another lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is no need to be too legal or regimented.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Everything depends on how the Holy Spirit leads.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you would visit this one in this way ten times a week, he will surely become stable.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All the mothers know that the period after a child is first born is the most dangerous one.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is easy to catch diseases at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But after a month or two, the condition will become more stable.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When we help a newly baptized person to go on, the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As soon as a person is baptized, immediately we have to feed him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is why the Lord said to Peter, Do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we do love Him, then we have to feed the lambs John 21:15 .</S>
