   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Jer 1:1-3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our life-study of the Word, we now come to the book of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although many of us may not be familiar with Jeremiah, I hope that the Lord will stir up our interest in this book and show us its intrinsic purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Jeremiah has as its particular nature and standing God's tenderheartedness plus God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our God is a tenderhearted God, and He is absolutely righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is full of compassion, sympathy, and tender care, yet He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the righteous God, He cannot spare those who have sinned against Him; He has to judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This book is also an autobiography in which Jeremiah tells us of his situation, his person, and his feeling, revealing his tender heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jehovah is the tenderhearted God, and in being tenderhearted Jeremiah is absolutely one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because Jeremiah often wept, even wailed, he is called the weeping prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In his weeping Jeremiah represented God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, God could use a prophet like Jeremiah to express Him, speak for Him, and represent Him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This book also deals with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Israel is stubborn, evil, wicked, and stiff-necked, knowing nothing of repentance or of returning to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Israel is altogether not one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jeremiah also speaks much concerning the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to this book, in the sight of God, all the nations, all the Gentiles, are animals, acting as if they do not have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not bear any kind of image or likeness of God nor understand anything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the book of Jeremiah four parties are revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first party is God, who is tender, loving, compassionate, and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second party is Jeremiah, a timid young man raised up by God to be His mouthpiece to speak for Him and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As God's mouthpiece, Jeremiah is one with God in being tenderhearted, loving, and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In contrast, Israel, the third party, is evil and stubborn, and the fourth party, consisting of the nations, is even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us now go on to consider, in an introductory way, certain important aspects of the book of Jeremiah.</S>
